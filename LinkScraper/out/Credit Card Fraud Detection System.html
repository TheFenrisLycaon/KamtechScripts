    <h2>Python Machine Learning Project on Credit Card Fraud Detection System</h2>
    <p>Today we will discuss the <b>Credit Card Fraud Detection System Machine Learning Project</b>. In this project, we will find out how to achieve the exposure of credit card frauds. We would go through different algorithms such as Logistic Regression,
        Artificial Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and finally, Decision Trees. For credit card fraud detection, our project will use the Card dealings dataset, which includes a mix of fraud and non-fraudulent transactions.</p>
    <p>This <b>Credit Card Fraud Detection System Machine Learning Project</b> aims to make a classifier capable of detecting credit card fraudulent transactions. We will apply a mixture of machine learning algorithms that can distinguish fraudulent from
        non-fraudulent ones. After completing this project, users will learn how to use machine learning algorithms for performing classification. </p>
    <p>The <b>Credit Card Fraud Detection System Machine Learning Project uses user behavior and position scanning to
            verify unusual patterns.</b> These patterns consist of user characteristics like user expenditure patterns and regular user geographic locations to confirm his identity. If any abnormal pattern is identified, the system calls for revivification.
        The network may need the user to log in once more or even block him for the above three invalid attempts.</p>
    <h2>Core Features:</h2>
    <ul style="padding:revert">
        <li>The Credit Card Fraud Detection System Machine Learning Project system stores earlier transaction patterns for every user.</li>
        <li>Based on the user expenditure ability and even state, it calculates the userâ€™s characteristics.</li>
        <li>Over 20 -30 % difference in user transaction is considered as an invalid attempt, and the system takes action.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So, now you are prepared to identify the fraud. The Credit Card Fraud Detection System Machine Learning Project is essential technology of this era and expected to last forever. Students can start using our Card Fraud Detection System Machine Learning
        Project for your academic requirements for FREE.</p>
