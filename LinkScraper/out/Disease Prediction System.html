    <h2>Python Machine Learning Project on Disease Prediction System</h2>
    <p>If you want to set up machine learning in medical science, in that case, this Disease Prediction System Machine Learning Project may be exciting to you. The primary task of our project is to predict various diseases.</p>
    <h2>Highlights of the Project</h2>
    <ul style="padding:revert">
        <li>You may use this project for any type of disease. You can download the dataset from our Learning Repository.
        </li>
        <li>In our database, there are several prediction tools for you.</li>
        <li>To build up this project, you need to have a basic idea of the random forest.</li>
        <li>You will get a full description of the project.</li>
        <p>The k- mean algorithm is generally used to predict diseases analyzing patient health data and treatment history. Prediction by a traditional sickness threat model typically involves a machine learning and some supervised algorithm which uses guidance
            data with the label for the preparation of the models.</p>
        <p><b>Disease prediction by patient health data and treatment history through machine learning techniques and
                applying data mining is a continuing struggle for past decades.</b> Lots of works have been done to data mining to pathological data or medicinal profiles to forecast particular diseases. Our new <b>Disease
                Prediction System Machine Learning Project</b> can be proved as a better solution for this.</p>
        <p>In many countries, many years of education are required for becoming a doctor. It’s a challenging field with high stakes, long hours, and a higher barrier to entry. Consequently, Prediction System Machine Learning Project has recently been a significant
            effort to lessen doctors’ workload and develop the overall competence of the health care method with machine learning.</p>
        <h2>Uses cases contain:</h2>
        <ul style="padding:revert">
            <li><b>Preventative care:</b> Predicting disease epidemic on both the personal and the public level.</li>
            <li><b>Diagnostic care:</b> Repeatedly classified illustration data, such as x-rays or scans, etc.</li>
            <li><b>Insurance:</b> Adjust premiums of coverage based on openly available risk factors.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As hospitals maintain to modernize patient reports and gather more grainy health information, Prediction System Machine Learning Project is the arrival of low-hanging fruit opportunity for health scientists to make a difference.</p>
