    <h2>Python Machine Learning Project on Heart Disease Prediction</h2>
    <p>The major killer of human death is Heart Disease. Many researchers have discovered new technologies to prognosticate the disease early before it's too late for helping healthcare and people. These processes are still under the research phase. <b>Heart Disease Prediction System Machine Learning Project</b>        is faster-emerging technology of Artificial Intelligence that contributes various algorithms for heart disease. Our project provides different classification algorithms to divine the probability of a patient having HD.</p>
    <p><b>Heart Disease Prediction System Machine Learning Project is an emerging AI application that uses different
            analytics and techniques to improve the performance of particular machine learning from old data.</b> It enables a specific machine to determine from the database and enhance the performance by experience. It helps to build an intelligent
        tool to solve a particular problem. ML addressed various complex issues that don't answer by statistic algorithms. Heart Disease Prediction System Machine Learning Project provides dynamic algorithms that quickly solve multiple challenging problems.
        These projects explained the different type of problem which is categorized into three-part. Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement type problems. In supervised, there are two types of issues, such as classification and regression problems.
        In unattended, there is a clustering type problem that can solve ML algorithms. Heart Disease Prediction System Machine Learning Project different algorithms based on their type of problem. The following steps do ML project:</p>
