    <p>In this <b>Image To Speech Convert Machine Learning Project</b>, the content is extracted from images with OCR; then, it is provided as the input for conversion to speech.</p>
    <p>This project aims to develop a tool that takes an image as input and extracts characters like symbols, alphabets, and digits from it. The image can include a Printed document. It is used as a type of data entry from the printed records. Our <b>Image To Speech Convert Machine Learning Project</b>        is based on Machine learning. The system can recognize the supply of a lot of data set as input to the software, and a similar pattern can be taken out from them. </p>
    <p>It is a challenge in artificial intelligence to enable natural communications between computers and people with multiple modalities. It is generally desirable to convert information between the same patterns. The conversion between image and speech
        using speech recognition and speech synthesis is an excellent example of it.</p>
    <p>This <b>Image To Speech Convert Machine Learning</b> Project will develop picture–to–text synthesis algorithms that can automatically produce text from original images so that the writing conveys the primary meaning of the image. Key components include
        extracting relevant information from the picture, generating corresponding documents, composing the text from a coherent picture, and lastly, evaluation. Our projects use statistical machine learning and draw ideas from text summarization, automatic
        machine translation, image-to-text synthesis, graphics, and computer vision.</p>
    <p>Picture-to-text synthesis is likely to have several significant impacts. It can improve literacy across a collection of groups, including kids, with the need for support in learning to read, and adults who want to learn a second language.</p>
    <p>Like most other machine learning projects, <b>Image To Speech Convert Machine Learning Project</b> also requires data from a wide range of environments to perform accurately. Keeping this in mind, our developers have put together a list of the top
        publicly available image recognition datasets. Please browse our catalog and choose the best one for you. </p>
