1. A combination of uniform flow and doublet flow gives ______________
a) flow past a circular cylinder
b) flow past a wedge
c) flow past a plate
d) flow over any body
a
In the above figure, the first diagram shows the uniform flow whereas, the second one shows the doublet flow (source sink combination of equal strength). The combination of these two leads to the flow past a cylinder. 
2. The stream function can be obtained by _______
a) sum of stream function of uniform flow and doublet flow
b) difference of stream function of uniform flow and doublet flow
c) sum of stream function of uniform flow and source flow
d) sum of stream function of uniform flow and sink flow
a
Ψ = U*y + ((-u/2*pi*r)*sin θ. 
3. The flow past cylinder is also called as _________
a) Vortex flow
b) Source flow
c) Rankine oval of equal axes
d) Newton’s ring
c
4. The shape of Rankine oval of equal axes can be found out by substituting ______________
a) Ψ=0
b) Ψ=1
c) U=0
d) U=1
a
5. What will be the shape of Rankine oval when sin θ=0?
a) vertical line
b) horizontal line
c) a point
d) curve
b
6. What will be the shape of Rankine oval when U*y+ ((-u/2*pi*r) = 0?
a) open curve
b) closed body profile
c) straight line
d) point
b
7. The amount of lift generated in the flow over a cylinder is __________
a) Infinity
b) Positive lift
c) Negative lift
d) No lift
d
8. In real life, zero drag is acceptable.
a) True
b) False
b
