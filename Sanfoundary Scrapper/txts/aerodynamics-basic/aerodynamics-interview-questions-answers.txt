1. Ram was on the bank of the river and was observing the flow of river. After sometime he got an idea and he started imagining certain points in the fluid and when he drew tangent to those points, he got direction of the flow. These lines are called as _____________
a) Streakline
b) Pathline
c) Streamline
d) Velocity vector
c
2. In the figure shown below, what does the fluid particle ‘A’ represents from t=0 to t=t?
a) Streamline
b) Streakline
c) Pathline
d) Velocity vector
c
3. The smoke particles coming out from the chimney falls under ____________
a) Streamline
b) Streakline
c) Path line
d) Position vector
b
4. Which of the following are the imaginary lines?
a) Streamline and pathline
b) Pathline and streakline
c) Streamline and streakline
d) Only streamline
a
5. In steady flow, streamline, streakline, pathline are the same.
a) True
b) False
a
6. The pathline equation is ______
a) y = xt
b) 2ln y = (ln x)2
c) x = y
d) x = -1 + y
b
Consider the velocity vector,
        V= Xi+Yj
        T=0, U=X and V=Y*t
        ln X=t and ln Y=t2/2
On substituting the above values we get, 2 lnY = (ln x)2. 
7. In steady state flow, the equation for streamline can be given by ________
a) x=0
b) y=0
c) x=y
d) x=-1
c
8. In an unsteady flow, the equation of streamline is given by __________
a) x=y
b) y=0
c) y=0
d) y=xt
d
     Here u=x and v=y*t
We know that dx/u=dy/v=dz/w
On substituting the vales and integrating, we get, y=xt. 
9. Which of the following is not related to the streamlines?
a) Mass
b) Velocity
c) Fluid flow
d) Fluid domain
a
10. Seeta used a closed curve as her start point, it will result in the ___________
a) plane
b) stream surface
c) stream line
d) stream plane
b
11. The streamlines depend on the frame of reference.
a) true
b) false
a
