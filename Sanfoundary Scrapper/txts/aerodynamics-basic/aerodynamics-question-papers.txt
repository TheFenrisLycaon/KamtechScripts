b) \(\frac {\pi }{4}\) 
c) \(\frac {-\pi }{8}\) 
d) –\(\frac {\pi }{4}\) 
a

10. The quarter-chord is the aerodynamic center for a cambered airfoil.
a) True
b) False
a
11. For a cambered airfoil, the center of pressure does not vary with_____
a) Chord length
b) Angle of attack
c) The shape of the airfoil
d) Location of the aerodynamic center
d
12. When the lift becomes zero, the center of pressure of the cambered airfoil is at which point on the airfoil (consider given lengths are from the leading edge)?
