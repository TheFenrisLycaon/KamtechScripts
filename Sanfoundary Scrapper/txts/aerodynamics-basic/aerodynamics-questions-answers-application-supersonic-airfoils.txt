1. Which of these equations is used for computing the lift and wave drag over a supersonic airfoil?
a) Cp=\(\frac {2θ}{\sqrt {M_∞^2-1}}\) 
b) Cp=\(\frac {2θ}{\sqrt {M_∞^2+1}}\) 
c) Cp=\(\frac {\sqrt {M_∞^2-1}}{θ}\) 
d) Cp=\(\frac {\sqrt {M_∞^2+1}}{θ}\) 
a
Where, θ is the angle made by surface relative to the horizontal. This value is very small
M∞ is the free stream mach number.
This formula is applicable for slender 2-dimensional body and can be used to for estimating the value of both lift and wave drag for supersonic airfoils.
2. What is the value of Cp at the forward surface in a biconvex airfoil?
a) Zero
b) Positive
c) Negative
d) Infinite
b
3. The Cp value for supersonic airfoil surface which is inclined away from the freestream is positive.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Which of these graphs represent the variation of Cp over a biconvex airfoil?

c)
d)
a
5. According to lineralized theory, what is the formula for coefficient of lift over the a flat plate in a supersonic flow?
a) cl=\(\frac {4α}{\sqrt {M_∞^2-1}}\) 
b) cl=\(\frac {4α^2}{\sqrt {M_∞^2-1}}\) 
c) cl=\(\frac {4α}{\sqrt {M_∞^2+1}}\) 
d) cl=\(\frac {4α^2}{\sqrt {M_∞^2+1}}\) 
a
cp,l=\(\frac {2α}{\sqrt {M_∞^2-1}}\) 
cp,u=\(\frac {-2α}{M_∞^2-1}\) 
The upper surface is inclined away from the free stream thus it has a negative value.
The normal and axial forces are computed as follows:
cn=\(\frac {1}{c} \int _0^c\) (cp,l-cp,u)dx=\(\frac {1}{c} \int _0^c \big ( \frac {2α}{\sqrt {M_∞^2-1}}-\frac {-2α}{\sqrt {M_∞^2-1}} \big ) \)dx
cn=\(\frac {4α}{\sqrt {M_∞^2-1}}\) 
Similarly,
ca=\(\frac {1}{c} \int _{LE}^{TE}\)(cp,u-cp,l)dy=0
The value above is zero because for a thin plate of negligible thickness, dy=0.
Substituting the normal and axial forces in coefficient of lift formula:
cl=cncosα-casin∝=cn-ca∝
This is because the value of ∝ is very very small resulting in cosα~1,sinα~α.
cl=\(\frac {4α}{\sqrt {M_∞^2-1}}\) 
6. Wave drag coefficient as derived from linearized theory is independent of the airfoil shape and thickness.
a) True
b) False
b
cd=\(\frac {4(α^2+g_c^2+g_t^2)}{\sqrt {M_∞^2-1}}\) 
7. What is the lift coefficient over a flat plate at an angle of attack of 3 degrees in a supersonic flow at Mach 4?
a) 0.0512
b) 0.0541
c) 0.0628
d) 0.0714
b
The lift coeeficient formula according to the linearized theory is :
cl=\(\frac {4α}{\sqrt {M_∞^2-1}}\) 
Substituting the values:
cl=\(\frac {4 × 0.05236}{\sqrt {4^2-1}}\)=0.0541
8. For supersonic flow, which differential equation is obtained for the linearized perturbation potential equation?
a) Elliptic partial differential equation
b) Hyperbolic differential equation
c) Parabolic differential equation
d) Linear differential equation
b
1-M\(_∞^2=\frac {∂^2 \hat {ϕ}}{∂x^2}+\frac {∂^2 \hat {ϕ}}{∂y^2}\)=0
Where, \(\hat {ϕ}\) is ther perturbation potential
M∞ is the free stream Mach number
In case of supersonic flow, 1-M\(_∞^2\) < 0 since Mach number is greater than 1. For this case the equation becomes hyperbolic differential equation which is of the type \( \frac {∂^2 u}{∂x^2}+\frac {∂^2 u}{∂y^2}\).
9. What happens to the coefficient of pressure in a supersonic flow for an increase in Mach number?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains unaffected
d) First increases then decreases
b
10. What is the source of wave drag exerted on the supersonic airfoil?
a) Shock waves
b) Skin friction
c) Viscous boundary layer
d) Trailing vortex
