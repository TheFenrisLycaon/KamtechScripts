1. Sonic flow exists at the throat of an equilibrium chemically reacting nozzle flow?
a) True
b) False
a
\(\frac {dA}{A}\)=(M2-1)\(\frac {du}{u}\) 
For sonic flow, Mach number = 1. Therefore for M=1 we get \(\frac {dA}{A}\)=0, thus sonic flow does exist for an equilibrium reacting nozzle flow at the throat.
2. For a subsonic flow, what should be the value of dA to get flow acceleration?
a) Zero
b) Negative
c) Positive
d) One
b
3. For which of these flows do we need a divergent duct to increase the velocity of the flow?
a) Subsonic flow
b) Supersonic flow
c) Hypersonic flow
d) Sonic flow
b
\(\frac {dA}{A}\)=(M2-1)\(\frac {du}{u}\) 
According to this formula, for supersonic flows the value of M2-1 is positive since M > 1. Thus, with increasing cross-sectional area, the velocity increases. Increasing area is achieved by convergent duct.
4. What happens to the velocity of the supersonic flow in the convergent duct?
a) Decreases
b) Increases
c) Remains the same
d) Changes periodically
a
5. What is the minimum area of a duct known as?
a) Throat
b) Minimum area duct
c) Convergent duct
d) Divergent duct
a
6. Which equation is obtained when Mach number is equated to zero in area-velocity relation?
a) Momentum equation
b) Continuity equation
c) Energy equation
d) Bernoulli’s equation
b
\(\frac {dA}{A}\)=(M2-1)\(\frac {du}{u}\) 
In the above equation if we substitute M=0 we get,
\(\frac {dA}{A}=-\frac {du}{u}\) 
On integrating this equation we get:
Au=constant
This is the continuity equation for incompressible flow in a duct
7. The trends of velocity change in a duct for both subsonic and supersonic flow are identical.
a) True
b) False
b
