1. What is the blade element theory used for?
a) Predict performance of airscrew airfoil
b) Predict performance of wind turbine
c) Predict performance of supersonic airfoil
d) Predict performance of flat plate
a
2. Which shape is traced by the trailing vortex at the tip of the airscrew blade?
a) Helix
b) Solenoid
c) Circle
d) Sine curve
a
3. The bound and trailing vortex cancel out each other in the plane of the airscrew blade.
a) True
b) False
b
4. How many times is the angular velocity of flow behind airscrew compared to that of angular velocity in plane of airscrew?
a) Same
b) Twice
c) Thrice
d) Four times
b
ω=(b+β)Ω=2bΩ
This value is twice that of the angular velocity in plane of the airscrew.
5. When is the blade element theory applicable?
a) When solidity is much greater than 1
b) When solidity is much lesser than 1
c) When solidity is equal to 1
d) When solidity is equal to 0
b
\(\frac {s}{c}\) >> !
And solidity should be much lesser than 1. Solidity is defined by:
σ=\(\frac {Bc}{πr}\) 
Where, B is number of blades
C is the chord length
R is the radius

6. How does the blade element theory treat the airfoil as?
a) One-dimensional
b) Two-dimensional
c) Three-dimensional
d) One complete body
b
7. Why is blade element theory preferred over momentum theory for designing a propeller?
a) Assumes flow inside stream tube as constant
b) Neglects span wise flow
c) Model thrust lag
d) Account for varying blade geometry
d
8. What is the formula for the helix angle?
a) Φ=tan-1\(\frac {V_0}{V_E}\) 
b) Φ=sin-1\(\frac {V_0}{V_E}\) 
c) Φ=cos-1\(\frac {V_0}{V_E}\) 
d) Φ=tan-1\(\frac {V_E}{V_0}\) 
a
Φ=tan-1\(\frac {V_0}{V_E}\) 
Where, V0 is the forward airspeed of the aircraft
VE is the effective resultant velocity.
9. What is the inflow ratio for hovering?
a) 1-1.5
b) 0.05-0.07
c) 0.6-1
d) 0.01-0.05
b
λ=\(\frac {V+v}{ΩR}\) 
Where, V is the climb velocity which is zero for hovering
v is the induced velocity
Ω is the rate of rotation of the blade
R is the radius
The value of inflow ratio ranges between 0.05 and 0.07 for hovering.
