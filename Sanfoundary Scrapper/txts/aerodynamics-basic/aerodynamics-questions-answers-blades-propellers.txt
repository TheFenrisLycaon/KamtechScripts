1. Why is the flap hinge offset in articulated rotor?
a) Design constraints
b) Mechanical constraints
c) Aerodynamics constraints
d) Vibrational constraints
b
2. What is the use of mechanical lag damper?
a) Avoid ground instability
b) Dampen the hub vibration
c) Dampen the resonance in rotor blades
d) Absorb instabilities in hinges and flap
a
3. Which of these conditions is essential for a rotor airfoil when the helicopter has high forward speed?
a) Low critical Mach number
b) Low drag divergence
c) High critical Mach number
d) High angle of attack
c
4. Which of these is not suitable for helicopter blade?
a) Moderately hick airfoil
b) Thin airfoil
c) Small pitching moment
d) Unsymmetrical airfoil
d
5. Which of these options is a feature of teetering rotor blade?
a) Two blades attached to hub without flap/hinge
b) Three blades attached to hub with only flaps
c) Two blades attached to hub with single flap hinge
d) Four blades attached directly to hub
a
6. What is the flap frequency of a gimballed rotor?
a) 1/rev
b) 2/rev
c) 0.5/rev
d) 10/rev
a
7. Which of these is not the purpose of rotor blade?
a) Generate lift
b) Counter weight
c) Provide thrust
d) Generate drag
d
8. Helicopter blades have large diameter.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Which of these is an important parameter for selecting the rotor blade based on aerodynamic efficiency?
a) Solidity ratio
b) Structural ratio
c) Figure of merit
d) Hovering ratio
c
M=\(\frac {1}{Κ+\frac {3}{4}\frac {c_{d_0}/\overline {c}_l}{\lambda _h}}\) 
Where, Κ is an empirical factor which accounts for losses in the rotor
cl is mean lift coefficient
cd0 is profile drag
High value of the figure of merit is achieved when the airfoil has low drag for high lift coefficient.
10. For forward flight, the airfoil of the blade have fixed stall characteristics.
a) True
b) False
b
