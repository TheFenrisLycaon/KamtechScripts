1. At low temperature, low – lying states close to the ground energy levels are overly populated.
a) True
b) False
a
2. What does Boltzmann distribution tell us?
a) Energy levels
b) Distribution of molecules at different energy levels
c) Distribution of electrons in a molecule
d) Magnitude of different energy levels of a molecule
b
N\(_j^*\) = N\(\frac {g_j e^{- \frac {ε_j^{‘}}{kT}}}{∑_jg_j e^{ – \frac {ε_j^{‘}}{kT}}} \) 
Where, ε\(_j^{‘}\) is total energy
gj are the degenerate states
N are the number of molecules
3. What is a partition function Q a function of?
a) Volume
b) Temperature
c) Temperature and volume
d) Volume and mass
c
Q = ∑jgje\(^{- \frac {ε_j^{‘}}{kT}}\) 
This partition function has its use in statistical thermodynamics and is a function of both temperature and volume.
4. Boltzmann distribution tells us the distribution of molecules in an unsteady system.
a) True
b) False
b
5. How does the probability of finding molecule in an energy state vary?
a) Parabolic
b) Exponential
c) Hyperbolic
d) Linear
b
