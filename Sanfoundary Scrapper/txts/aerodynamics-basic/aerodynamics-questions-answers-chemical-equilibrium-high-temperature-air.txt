1. Which of these reactions is not carried out for the formation of nitric oxide?
a) Dissociation reaction of oxygen molecule
b) Dissociation reaction of nitrogen molecule
c) Shuffle reaction of nitric oxide molecule
d) Dissociative – recombination reaction of nitrogen and oxygen
d
           O2 + M ⇌ 2O + M
           N2 + M ⇌ 2N + M
           NO + M ⇌ N + O + M
           O2 + N ⇌ NO + O
The first two reaction are the dissociation of oxygen and nitrogen molecule respectively. The third and the fourth equations are the shuffle reactions.
2. The dissociative – recombination reaction below yields in NO.
        N + O ⇌ NO + e- 
a) True
b) False
b
3. What is the equation of rate of formation of oxygen atoms in the following chemical reaction? (M is the collision molecule)
            O2 + M → 2O + M
a) \(\frac {d[O_2]}{dt}\) = k[O2][M] 
b) \(\frac {d[O]}{dt}\) = 2k[O2][M] 
c) \(\frac {d[O_2]}{dt}\) = 2k[O][M] 
d) \(\frac {d[O]}{dt}\) = k[O][M] 
b
\(\frac {d[O]}{dt}\) = 2k[O2][M] 
Where, [O] is the number of moles of oxygen atom per unit volume of mixture
[O2] is the number of moles of oxygen molecule per unit volume of mixture
k is the reaction rate constant.
4. For the equilibrium reaction, what is the relation between the forward and reverse reaction rate constant?
          O2 + M ⇌ 2O + M 
a) kf = kb\(\frac {[O]}{[O_2]}\) 
b) kf = kb\(\frac {[O]^{*2}}{[O_2]^{*}}\) 
c) kf = kb\(\frac {[M]^{*}}{[O_2]}\) 
d) kf = kb\(\frac {[O_2]}{[O]} \) 
b
The net rate of reaction is the net sum of both forward and reverse reaction resulting in:
\(\frac {d[O]}{dt}\) = 2kf [O2][M] – 2kb  [O]2 [M] 
After substituting the equilibrium conditions in the above equation, we get
0 = 2kf [O2]* [M]* – 2kb  [O]*2 [M]*
2kf [O2]* [M]* = 2kb  [O]*2 [M]*
kf = kb  \(\frac {[O]^{*2}}{[O_2]^{*}}\) 
5. What is the value of equilibrium constant based on concentrations if the forward and reverse rate constant of a non – equilibrium reaction are 1.85 × 10-4 and 2.34 × 10-5?
a) 6.45
b) 7.91
c) 8.43
d) 2.31
b
The equilibrium constant based on concentrations for non – equilibrium is same as derived for the equilibrium condition since it relates the forward and reverse rate constants. It is given by:
kc = \(\frac {k_f}{k_b}\) 
Substituting the values, we get,
kc = \(\frac {1.85 × 10^{- 4}}{2.34 × 10^{- 5}}\) = 7.91
6. 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O is an elementary chemical reaction.
a) True
b) False
b
