b
11. What is the formula to compute the efficiency of diffusers?
a) ηD = \(\frac {(\frac {p_{d_0}}{p_0})_{actual }}{(\frac {p_{0_2}}{p_{01}})_{normal \, shock \, at \, M_e}}\) 
b) ηD = \(\frac {(\frac {p_{d_0}}{p_0})_{actual }}{(\frac {p_{0_2}}{p_{01}})_{oblique \, shock \, at \, M_e}}\) 
c) ηD = \(\frac {(\frac {p_{0_2}}{p_{01}})_{normal \, shock \, at \, M_e}}{(\frac {p_{d_0}}{p_0})_{actual }}\) 
d) ηD = \(\frac {(\frac {p_{0_2}}{p_{01}})_{oblique \, shock \, at \, M_e}}{(\frac {p_{d_0}}{p_0})_{actual }}\) 
a
12. What is the diffuser efficiency of a normal shock diffuser?
a) 1
b) 0
c) Inifinty
d) \(\frac {1}{2}\) 
a
ηD = \(\frac {(\frac {p_{d_0}}{p_0})_{actual }}{(\frac {p_{0_2}}{p_{01}})_{normal \, shock \, at \, M_e}}\) 
In case of normal shock diffuser, the numerator will be equal to the denominator, hence the efficiency is one.
