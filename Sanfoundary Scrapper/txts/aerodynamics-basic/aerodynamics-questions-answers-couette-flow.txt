1. What is an assumption made while considering Couette flow?
a) Flow is unparallel
b) No slip condition between two plates
c) Flow is inviscid
d) Both the plates are stationary
b
2. The two plate in Couette flow are kept at the same temperature.
a) True
b) False
b
3. Which of these phenomena results in viscous dissipation?
a) Kinetic energy transformed into internal energy
b) Acceleration of flow
c) Temperature gradient
d) Hot wall and cold wall case
a
4. What is a cold wall case?
a) Heat flowing from fluid to wall
b) Heat flowing from wall to fluid
c) Reducing temperature of upper wall
d) Reducing temperature of lower wall
a
5. Which of these laws is used to find the heat flux at a point in the fluid?
a) Fourier law
b) Fick’s law
c) Newton’s law
d) Kepler’s law
a
\(\dot {q}_y\) =  – k\(\frac {∂T}{∂y}\) 
Where, heat flux is in the y – direction
Minus sign indicates that the heat flows from high temperature to low temperature and thus \(\dot {q}_y\) is in opposite direction to the temperature gradient.
6. Couette flow is a constant pressure flow.
a) True
b) False
a
\(\frac {∂p}{∂y}\) = 0
From this equation, it is evident that the variation of pressure in y – direction is zero. Hence, pressure in Couette flow is constant.
7. How does the velocity vary in case of incompressible Couette flow?
a) Linear
b) Parabolic
c) No variation
d) Hyperbolic
a
u = ue (\(\frac {y}{D}\))
Where, ue is the velocity at y = D that is at the upper plate.
According to the formula, the flow varies linearly across the flow field.
8. What happens to the shear stress if the thickness between the two plates is increased in a Couette flow?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains same
d) Becomes infinite
b
τ = μ(\(\frac {u_e}{D}\))
Where, ue is the velocity at y = D that is at the upper plate.
τ is the shear stress
D is the thickness of the vicsous shear layer/distance between the two parallel plates
As peer the formula, then the thickness of the viscous shear layer increases, the shear stress decreases provided the other properties remain the same.
9. Which of these laws is obeyed by a Newtonian fluid?
a) Shear stress law
b) Newtonian law
c) Incompressible fluid law
d) Prandtl law
a
The shear stress law is given by:
τ = μ(\(\frac {∂u}{∂y}\))
This formula helps in obtaining the shear stress at any point in the fluid flow.
10. Where does the maximum value of the temperature occurs in a Couette flow?
a) Top plate
b) Bottom plate
c) Midpoint between the two plates
d) No maximum temperature occurs
c
T = Tw + \(\frac {Pru_e^2}{2c_p} \big [\frac {y}{D} – \big ( \frac {y}{D} \big )^2 \big ] \) 
Where, Tw is the temperature at y = 0 that is at the lower plate
ue is the velocity at y = D that is at the upper plate.
Pr is Prandtl number
cp is coefficient of pressure
D is the distance between the two plates
According to this, the temperature in Couette flow varies parabolically in y – direction. The maximum temperature occurs at y = D/2 which is the midpoint between the two parallel plates.
Tmax = Tw + \(\frac {Pru_e^2}{8c_p}\)
