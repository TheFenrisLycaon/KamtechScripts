1. What is a critical Mach number?
a) Freestream Mach number for which stagnation pressure is obtained
b) Freestream Mach number for which sonic flow is obtained
c) Free stream Mach number for which supersonic flow is obtained
d) Freestream Mach number for which hypersonic flow is obtained
b
2. The local Mach number at a point on the airfoil reaches 1 for critical Mach number.
a) True
b) False
a
3. What is the coefficient of pressure at the minimum pressure point for an airfoil with critical Mach number as 0.6?
a) 1.53
b) 1.66
c) 1.42
d) 1.15
b
The critical Mach number is calculated using the relation
(Cp)crit = \(\frac {2}{γM_{crit}^{2}} \bigg [ \frac {1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)M_{crit}^{2}}{1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)} \bigg ]^{\frac {γ}{γ – 1}}\) – 1
On substituting the values, we get
(Cp)crit = \(\frac {2}{1.4×0.6^{2}} \bigg [ \frac {1 + \frac {(1.4 – 1)}{2} 0.6^{2}}{1 + \frac {(1.4 – 1)}{2}} \bigg ]^{\frac {1.4}{1.4 – 1}}\) – 1
(Cp)crit = 3.97\(\big [ \frac {1.07}{1.20} \big ] \)3.5 – 1 = 1.66
4. What is the coefficient of pressure at minimum pressure point a function of?
a) Critical Mach number
b) Freestream Mach number
c) Chord/thickness ratio of airfoil
d) Length of the airfoil
a
(Cp)crit = \(\frac {2}{γM_{crit}^{2}} \bigg [ \frac {1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)M_{crit}^{2}}{1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)} \bigg ]^{\frac {γ}{γ – 1}}\) – 1
In this the value of gamma is constant depending on the medium. The only varying quantity is critical Mach number. Thus, the coefficient of pressure at minimum pressure point is a function of only critical Mach number.
5. Thicker the airfoil, higher is the critical Mach number.
a) True
b) False
b
Cp = \(\frac {C_{p_0}}{\sqrt {1 – M_∞^{2}}}\) 
For airfoils which are thin, the flow has less expansion resulting in less magnitude of Cp0. This results in a higher critical Mach number value. On the other hand thick airfoils have higher magnitude of Cp0 because of strong flow expansion. This results in lower critical Mach number.
6. What is the relation between the drag divergence Mach number and critical Mach number?
a) Mdrag – divergence = Mcrit
b) Mdrag – divergence > Mcrit
c) Mdrag – divergence < Mcrit
d) Mdrag – divergence × Mcrit = 0
b
7. Which of these techniques is employed to delay the critical Mach number?
a) Increasing the thickness of airfoil
b) Swept wing
c) Increase camber
d) Decrease drag – divergence Mach number
b
8. Which equation is used to compute the critical Mach number of the airfoil?
a) (Cp)crit = \(\frac {2}{γM_{crit}^{2}} \bigg [ \frac {1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)M_{crit}^{2}}{1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)} \bigg ]^{\frac {γ}{γ – 1}}\) – 1
b) (Cp)crit = \(\frac {2}{γM_{crit}^{2}} \bigg [ \frac {1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)M_{crit}^{2}}{1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)} \bigg ]^{\frac {γ}{γ + 1}}\) + 1
c) (Cp)crit = γM\(_{crit}^{2} \bigg [ \frac {1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)}{1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)} \bigg ]^{\frac {γ}{γ – 1}}\) – 1
d) (Cp)crit = γM\(_{crit}^{2} \bigg [ \frac {1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)}{1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)M_{crit}^{2}} \bigg ]^{\frac {γ}{γ – 1}}\) – 1
a
Cp = \(\frac {2}{γM_∞^{2}} \bigg ( \frac {p}{p_∞}  – 1 \bigg )\) 
For an isentropic flow, the ratio of pressure at a point to the freestream pressure is given by:
\(\frac {p}{p_∞}  = \bigg [ \frac {1 + \frac {(γ – 1)}{2} M_∞^{2}}{1 + \frac {(γ – 1)}{2} M^{2}} \bigg ]^{\frac {γ}{γ – 1}} \) 
Substituting this in the above equation we get
Cp = \(\frac {2}{γM_∞^{2}} \bigg [ \bigg ( \frac {1 + \frac {(γ – 1)}{2} M_∞^{2}}{1 + \frac {(γ – 1)}{2} M^{2}}\bigg ) ^{\frac {γ}{γ – 1}} – 1 \bigg ] \) 
At critical Mach number, local Mach number M = 1 and freestream Mach number is equal to the critical Mach number. Substituting these we finally arrive at the relation:
(Cp)crit = \(\frac {2}{γM_{crit}^{2}} \bigg [ \frac {1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)M_{crit}^{2}}{1 + \frac {1}{2}(γ – 1)} \bigg ]^{\frac {γ}{γ – 1}}\) – 1

b) The flow around airfoil becomes supersonic
c) The flow around airfoil becomes sonic
d) The flow around airfoil becomes hypersonic

a) Form drag

c) Pressure drag
d) Skin – friction drag
