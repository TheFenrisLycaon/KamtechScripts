1. What does the curl of velocity field give us?
a) Moment of Inertial
b) Angular velocity
c) Angular acceleration
d) Moment
b
ω = \(\frac {1}{2}\) ∇ × V
2. How is the vorticity related to the angular velocity?
a) Twice of angular velocity
b) Thrice of angular velocity
c) No difference
d) Half of angular velocity
a
∇ × V
The value of vorticity is twice as much as the angular velocity whose formula is:
ω = \(\frac {1}{2}\) ∇ × V
3. What does Crocco’s theorem establish?
a) Relationship between inertial and fluid properties
b) Relationship between fluid and thermodynamic properties
c) Give the body forces
d) Determine the relation between vorticity and angular velocity
b
4. Which of these is Crocco’s theorem?
a) V × (∇ × V) = ∇h0 – T∇s
b) V(∇ × V) = ∇h0
c) (∇ × V) = T∇s
d) (∇ × V) = ∇h0 + T∇s
a
V × (∇ × V) = ∇h0 – T∇s
5. According to Crocco’s theorem, the vorticity behind the curved shockwave is zero.
a) True
b) False
b
6. Crocco’s theorem gives a relation between which of the following?
a) Entropy and flow velocity
b) Gradient of entropy and vorticity
c) Gradient of angular acceleration and enthalpy
d) Flow velocity and enthalpy
b
V × (∇ × V) = ∇h0 – T∇s
Where, ∇ × V is the vorticity
∇h0 is gradient of total enthalpy
T∇s is gradient of entropy
7. Flow passing through curved shock creates vorticity in the downstream.
a) True
