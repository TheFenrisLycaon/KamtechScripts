1. For a finite wing, the local airfoil section sees the angle of attack which is called as ____
a) Downwash angle
b) Induced angle of attack
c) Relative angle of attack
d) Effective angle of attack
d
Effective angle of attack = Geometric angle of attack – induced angle of attack.

a) True
b) False
a
3. Which is the correct statement with regards to the flow over a finite wing?
a) Local lift is vertical
b) Downward velocity increases lift
c) Local lift is inclined to vertical by induced angle of attack
d) Free-stream velocity causes all the drag
c
4. Select the incorrect statement for a flow over wings.
a) Induced drag comes from pressure- drag
b) Pressure imbalance makes D’Alembert’s paradox does not occur
c) 3D flow over wings cause induced drag
d) Induced drag is a ‘type’ of pressure- drag
