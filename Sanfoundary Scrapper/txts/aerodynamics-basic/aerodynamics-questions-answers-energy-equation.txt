a
2. The kinetic energy of an object depends only on magnitude.
a) True
b) False
c
3. The formula for kinetic energy is __________
a) KE = 0.5*m*v
b) KE = 0.5*m*v2
c) KE = m*v2
d) KE = 0.6*m*v2

5. The SI unit of kinetic energy is ___________
a) Newton
b) Joules
c) Pascal
d) Meters
b
6. Determine the kinetic energy of the body of mass 90 kg moving with a speed of 200 m/s.
a) 15000 Joules
b) 900000 Joules
c) 21000 Joules
d) 40000 Joules
b
Substitute the values in the formula.
Here, m=90 kg and v= 200 m/s.
On solving the above equation we get,
KE=0.5*90*(200)2= 900000 Joules.
