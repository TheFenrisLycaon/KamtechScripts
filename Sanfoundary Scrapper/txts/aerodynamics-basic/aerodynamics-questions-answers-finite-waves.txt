b) False
a
3. What is the region in a finite wave called where density increases?

5. Which of these is the compatibility equation along C+ characteristic line?
a) du + \(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = 0
b) du – \(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = 0
c) \(\frac {dpu}{ρa}\) = 0
d) \(\frac {du}{ρa}\) = 0
a
du + \(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = 0
The compatibility equation along C– line is:
du – \(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = 0
6. What is the slope for C– characteristic line?
a) u + a
b) u – a
c) ua
d) \(\frac {u}{a}\) 
b
7. Riemann invariants are obtained by differentiating the compatibility equations for the characteristic lines.
a) True
b) False
b
8. What is the Riemann invariant for C+ characteristic line?
a) J+ = u + ∫\(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = constant
b) J+ = u – ∫\(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = constant
c) J+ = u + \(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) 
d) J+ = u – \(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) 
a
The compatibility equation along C+ characteristic line is given by:
du + \(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = 0
On integrating the above equation, we get:
J+ = u + ∫\(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = constant
Where, J+ is the Riemann invariant
9. If the Riemann variants are known, how can we compute the mass – motion velocity u?
a) \(\frac {J_++J_-}{2}\) 
b) \(\frac {J_+-J_-}{2}\) 
c) \(\frac {J_+×J_-}{3}\) 
d) \(\frac {J_+×J_-}{6}\) 
a
u = \(\frac {J_++J_-}{2}\) 
10. How is local velocity of sound related to the Riemann invariants?
a) a = \(\frac {γ – 1}{4}\)(J+ + J–)
b) u = \(\frac {γ – 1}{4}\)(J+ J–)
c) a = \(\frac {γ – 1}{4}\)(J+ – J–)
d) a = γ – 1(J+ – J–)
c
J+ = u + \(\frac {2a}{γ – 1}\) = constant
J– = u – \(\frac {2a}{γ – 1}\) = constant
Where J+ is along C+ characteristic line and J– is along C– characteristic line. When we solve these two equations, we obtain the local velocity of sound which is given by:
a = \(\frac {γ – 1}{4}\)(J+ – J–)
