1. Which of these parameters in quasi – one dimensional flow varies w.r.t. x as opposed to the one – dimensional flow?
a) Cross – sectional area
b) Pressure
c) Density
d) Temperature
a
2. What is the momentum equation for a quasi – one dimensional flow?
a) p1A1 + ρ1u\(_1 ^2\)A1 + \(\int _{A_1} ^{A_2}\)pdA = p2A2 + ρ2u\(_2 ^2\)A2
b) p1A1u1 + ρ1u\(_1 ^2\)A1 + \(\int _{A_1} ^{A_2}\)pdA = p2A2u2 + ρ2u\(_2 ^2\)A2
c) p1A1 + ρ1u\(_1 ^2\)A1 = p2A2 + ρ2u\(_2 ^2\)A2
d) p1A1u1 + ρ1u\(_1 ^2\)A1 = p2A2u2 + ρ2u\(_2 ^2\)A2
a
&Conint;s(ρV.dS)V = – &Conint;spdS
In order to find the x – component of this the equation becomes:
&Conint;s(ρV.dS)u = – &Conint;spdSx
Where, pdSx is the x component of pressure
u is the velocity
On the control surfaces of the streamtube, V.dS = 0 because they are streamlines. At 1, A1, V,dS are in opposite direction thus they are negative. This results in the left side of the equation to be – ρ1u\(_1 ^2\)A1 + ρ2u\(_2 ^2\)A2.
For the right side of the equation, it is – (-p1A1 + p2A2). Negative sign is because at A1, dS points to the left and is negative.
For the upper and lower surfaces of the control volume, pressure integral becomes:
 – \(\int _{A_1} ^{A_2}\) – pdA = \(\int _{A_1} ^{A_2}\)pdA
Where the negative sign is because the dS points to the left.
This results In the equation to be:
 – ρ1u\(_1 ^2\)A1 + ρ2u\(_2 ^2\)A2 = – ( – p1A1 + p2A2 ) + \(\int _{A_1} ^{A_2}\)pdA
On rearraging the terms we get:
p1A1 + ρ1u\(_1 ^2\)A1 + \(\int _{A_1} ^{A_2}\)pdA = p2A2 + ρ2u\(_2 ^2\)A2
3. Which is the Euler’s equation for the quasi – one dimensional flow?
a) dp = \(\frac {ρ}{u}\)du
b) dp = – \(\frac {u}{ρ}\)du
c) dp = – ρudu
d) dp = ρudu
c
Using the momentum equation:
p1A1 + ρ1u\(_1 ^2\)A1 + \(\int _{A_1} ^{A_2}\)pdA = p2A2 + ρ2u\(_2 ^2\)A2
We get,
pA + ρu2A + pdA = (p + dp)(A + dA) + (ρ + dρ)(u + du)2(A + dA)
pA + ρu2A + pdA = pA + pdA + Adp + dpdA + ρu2 + (ρdu2 + 2ρudu + dρu2 + dρdu2 + 2dρudu)(A + dA)
Since the conditions at station 1 are: p,ρ,A and conditions at station 2 are (p + dp),(ρ + dρ),(A + dA).
The product of differentials dPdA, dρ(du)2 (A + dA) are negligible thus are ignored.
The resulting equation is:
AdP + Adρu2 + ρu2 dA + 2ρuAdu = 0 ➔ eqn 1
The continuity equation is given by:
d(uρA) = 0
Explanding this we get,
ρudA + ρAdu + Audρ = 0
Multiplying the above equation by u on both sides we get:
ρu2 dA + ρuAdu + Au2 dρ = 0 ➔ eqn 2
Subtracting eqn 2 from eqn 1, we get the differential equation for the quasi one – dimensional flow:
dp = – ρudu
4. What is the differential form of momentum equation for the quasi one – dimensional flow known as?
a) Froude equation
b) Euler’s equation
c) Kelvin’s equation
d) Bernoulli’s equation
b
dp = – ρudu
This is known as Euler’s equation which is derived from the momentum equation.
5. For which of these flows do we need a convergent duct to increase the velocity of the flow?
a) Subsonic flow
b) Supersonic flow
c) Hypersonic flow
d) Sonic flow
a
\(\frac {dA}{A}\) = (M2 – 1)\(\frac {du}{u}\) 
According to this formula, for subsonic flows the value of M2 – 1 becomes negative since 0 < M < 1. Thus, with decreasing cross – sectional area, the velocity increases. Decreasing area is achieved by convergent duct.
6. What happens to the velocity of the supersonic flow in the divergent duct?
a) Decreases
b) Increases
c) Remains the same
d) Changes periodically
b
7. State true or false. Divergent – convergent nozzles are used to achieve supersonic flow.
a) True
b) False
b
8. What is the differential form of energy equation for quasi one – dimensional flow?
a) dh – u2du = 0
b) dh – udu = 0
c) dh + u2du = 0
d) dh + udu = 0
d
h + \(\frac {u^2}{2}\) = constant
On differentiating the above equation we arrive at the differential energy equation for the quasi one – dimensional flow:
dh + udu = 0
9. The area – Mach number relation yields how many solutions for a given Mach number?
a) 2
b) 4
c) 6
d) 0

10. In case of flow inside a nozzle, how should the exit pressure be in relation to the inlet pressure?

b) pB > pe
c) pB < pe
d) pB = 2pe
