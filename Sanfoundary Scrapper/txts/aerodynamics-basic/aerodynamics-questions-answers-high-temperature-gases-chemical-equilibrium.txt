1. At high temperature, there’s presence of only oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the air.
a) True
b) False
b
2. Which of these methods is not used in describing the composition of air which is at a chemical equilibrium?
a) Partial pressure
b) Partial temperature
c) Mass fraction
d) Mole – mass ratio
b
3. What is Dalton’s law?
a) Total temperature is equal to sum of partial temperatures
b) Total entropy is equal to sum of partial entropies
c) Total pressure is equal to sum of partial pressures
d) Total number of moles is equal to sum of mole fractions
c
4. What is the equilibrium constant for the following reaction?
        XY ⇄ X + Y       
a) \(\frac {p_X p_Y}{p_{XY}}\) = Kp(T)
b) \(\frac {p_X + p_Y}{p_X p_Y}\) = Kp(T)
c) \(\frac {p_X – p_Y}{p_X p_Y}\) = Kp(T)
d) \(\frac {p_X + p_Y}{p_X – p_Y}\) = Kp(T)
a
Kp(T) = ∏ip\(_i^{v_i}\) 
Where, vi is stoichiometric mole number for i species (this is negative for reactants and positive for products)
pi is partial pressure of each species
There for the above reaction the equilibrium constant is given by:
\(\frac {p_X p_Y}{p_{XY}}\) = Kp(T)
5. What is chemical equilibrium?
a) Change in temperature spontaneously
b) No change in chemical composition spontaneously
c) Change in pressure
d) Equilibrium between mole fractions
b
6. For the reaction below, what is the relation between the rate of forward and reverse reaction?
          N2 ⇆ 2N        
a) Ratef = Rater
b) Ratef > Rater
c) Ratef < Rater
d) Ratef Rater = 1
a
This implies: \(\frac {k_f}{k_r} = \frac { [N]^2 }{ [ N_2 ] }\) 
7. What happens to a reaction when reaction quotient is equal to the equilibrium constant?
a) Forward reaction
b) Equilibrium
c) Reverse reaction
d) No change
c
