1. Which of these does not result in two or more flows being dynamically similar?
a) Streamlines are geometrically similar
b) The shape of the blunt body is same
c) Length of the body is same
d) Non dimensional parameters remain same
c
2. Why is hypersonic similarity parameter essential?
a) Supersonic flow over wedges
b) Hypersonic flow over slender bodies
c) Hypersonic flow over cone
d) Hypersonic flow over flat plate
b
3. For two bodies with same shape but different scales, which of these parameters must be equal for the flow to be same in hypersonic regime?
a) Mach number
b) Product of Mach number and slenderness ratio
c) Tangential flow velocity
d) Normal flow velocity
b
4. Two bodies holding hypersonic similarity at small angle of attack need the values of γ and M∞τ to be same.
a) True
b) False
b
5. The ratio \(\frac {C_p}{τ^{2}}\) behind a shock wave is a function of which of these parameters?
a) Hypersonic similarity parameter K and γ
b) Angle of attack and wedge angle
c) Coefficient of lift and wedge angle
d) Hypersonic similarity parameter and angle of attack
a
\(\frac {C_p}{τ^{2}}\) = f(K,γ)
According to this, \(\frac {C_p}{τ^{2}}\) is a function of only gamma and the hypersonic similarity parameter.
6. On which of this parameter is the coefficient of lift over a two – dimensional body at hypersonic flow dependent?
a) γ.\(\frac {α}{τ}\) 
b) γ, K, M∞
c) M∞T, \(\frac {α}{τ}\), γ
d) M∞T, K, γ
c
cl = \(\frac {1}{l} \int _0^{l}\)(Cpl – Cpu)dx
Where, Cpl – Cpu are coefficient of pressure over the upper and lower surface
l is the length of body
The above equation in terms of x is
cl = \(\int _0^{1}\)(Cpl – Cpu)dx
Diving this equation with the square of slenderness ratio, we get
\(\frac {c_l}{τ^{2}} = \int _0^{1}\)(Cpl – Cpu)dx = f(M∞T, \(\frac {α}{τ}\), γ)
Thus, coefficient of lift is a function of M∞T, \(\frac {α}{τ}\) and γ.
7. Hypersonic similarity is applicable for only irrotational flow.
a) True
b) False
b
8. For which range of values is the hypersonic similarity rule valid for very slender bodies?
a) K = 0.5 to infinity
b) K > 1.5
c) 0.5 < K < 1.5
d) 2 < K < 1000
