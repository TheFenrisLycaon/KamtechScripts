1. The chemical and vibrational process occur due to molecular collision.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Which of these parameters affect the number of collisions?
a) Pressure of the setup
b) Kinetic energy between the molecules
c) Density of the apparatus
d) Temperature of the apparatus
b
3. Time taken for the number of collisions depends on which of these parameters?
a) Molecular collision frequency
b) Molar density
c) Number of moles
d) Boltzmann constant
a
4. If the temperature increases, what happens to the molecular collision frequency?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) No change
d) First increases then decreases
b
Z ∝ \(\frac {p}{\sqrt {T}}\) 
Therefore, molecular collision frequency is inversely proportional to the square root of temperature which means that as the temperature increases, collision frequency decreases.
5. For which condition is collision theory low?
a) Low temperature and pressure
b) High temperature and pressure
c) Low temperature, high pressure
d) High temperature, low pressure
d
