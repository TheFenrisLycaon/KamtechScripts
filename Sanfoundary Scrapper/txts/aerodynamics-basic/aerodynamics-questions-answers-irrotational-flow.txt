1. What happens to the flow which passes through a curved shock wave?
a) Creates vorticity downstream
b) Creates vorticity upstream
c) Flow passes by undisturbed
d) Flow moves parallel to the curves shock wave
a

b) ∇ × V
c) ∇.V2
d) (∇.V) × V
b
3.  Vorticity is thrice as much as the angular velocity.

6. The special form of Euler’s equation dp = – ρVdV is applicable for rotational flow.
a) True
b) False
b
7. According to Euler’s equation, what happens to the velocity of the inviscid flow if the pressure increases?
a) No change
b) Increases
c) Decreases
d) Becomes zero
c
8. Which of these conditions is not met at a point for irrotational flow?
a) \(\frac {∂w}{∂y} = \frac {∂v}{∂z}\) 
b) \(\frac {∂w}{∂x} = \frac {∂u}{∂z}\) 
c) \(\frac {∂v}{∂x} = \frac {∂u}{∂z}\) 
d) \(\frac {∂v}{∂x} = \frac {∂u}{∂y}\) 
c
∇ × V = \(\begin{vmatrix}
   i & j & k  \\
   \frac {\partial }{\partial x} & \frac {\partial }{\partial y} & \frac {\partial }{\partial z}  \\
   u & v & w  \\
   \end{vmatrix} \) 
On expanding this we get,
i(\(\frac {∂w}{∂y} – \frac {∂v}{∂z}\)) – j(\(\frac {∂w}{∂x} – \frac {∂u}{∂z}\)) + k(\(\frac {∂v}{∂x} – \frac {∂u}{∂y}\)) = 0
For irrotational flow since vorticity = 0, ∇ × V = 0
\(\frac {∂w}{∂y} = \frac {∂v}{∂z}\) and \(\frac {∂w}{∂x} = \frac {∂u}{∂z}\) and \(\frac {∂v}{∂x} = \frac {∂u}{∂y}\) 
9. What is the value of angular velocity at a point on the solid surface outside the boundary layer where the velocity becomes equal to free stream velocity?
a) Infinite
b) One
c) Zero
d) 0.5
c
10. According to d’Alember’s paradox, what happens when the flow over a body is irrotational?
a) Results in infinite drag
b) Results in zero drag
c) Results in formation of vortices behind the body
d) Results in body forces
b
11. What is a velocity potential?
a) ∇ × ϕ
b) ∇ϕ
c) – ∇ × V
d) (∇ × V)ϕ
b
∇ × (∇ϕ) = 0
Thus the velocity potential is described as the scalar function ∇ϕ. It satisfies the Laplace equations as well.
