1. What forces are exerted on the body by a fluid flow?
a) Pressure force
b) Shear stress
c) Pressure and shear stress
d) Lift force
c
2. Thrust produced by engine is due to the shear stress distribution from the fluid.
a) True
b) False
b
3. What is the formula for net thrust of the engine?
a) F = -&Conint;pdS
b) F = &Conint;pdS
c) F = -&Conint;\(\frac {dS}{p}\) 
d) F = -&Conint;p2 dS
a
F = -&Conint;pdS
Where, p is the pressure distribution
dS is the outer surface over which it is integrated and thus vector points away from the surface
The negative sign is present because thrust acts in the opposite direction of the acceleration.
4. What is the static thrust for an engine as derived from the integral momentum equation?
a) T = \(\dot {m}\)ue + Ae(pe – p0)
b) T = \(\dot {m}\)Ae(pe – p0)
c) T = Ae(pe – p0)
d) T = \(\dot {m}\)Ae
a
∑Fx = T + Ae(p0 – pe)
Fx = \(\dot {m}\)ue
Thus, solving the equations we get,
T + Ae(p0 – pe) = \(\dot {m}\)ue
On rearranging the terms we get,
T = \(\dot {m}\)ue + Ae(pe – p0)
5. What is the thrust of an engine if the inlet and exhaust mass flow rate are 150 kg/s and 190 kg/s respectively with the pressure difference between the exhaust and ambient air is 1.85 × 104? The exhaust area is 2m2, the ambient and exhaust velocities are 280 m/s and 400 m/s.
a) 50 kN
b) 62 kN
c) 71 kN
d) 84 kN
c
Ve = 400 m/s.
The thrust equation is given by:
T = \(\dot {m}\)eVe – \(\dot {m}\)iV∞ + Ae(pe – p∞)
Substituting the values, we get
T = 190 × 400 – 150 × 280 + 2(1.85 × 104)
T = 76,000 – 42,000 + 37,000 = 71 kN
6. The integral form of the conservative equation is used for computing thrust of an engine.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Integral form of momentum equation cannot replace the need for theoretical and experimental measurements.
a) True
b) False
b
8. What happens to the integral ∫dS when the area of exhaust is less than the area of inlet?
a) Positive
b) Negative
c) Zero
d) Infinity
b
9. What causes thrust of an engine?
a) Change in momentum
b) Difference in lift distribution
c) Difference in drag distribution
d) Mass flow entering the engine
a
