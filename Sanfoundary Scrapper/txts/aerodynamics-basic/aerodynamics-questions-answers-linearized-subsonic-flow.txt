1. What is the surface boundary condition for a thin airfoil at a subsonic flow? (Where shape of the airfoil is represented as y = f(x))
a) \(\frac {∂ϕ}{∂x}\) = V∞ \(\frac {df}{dx}\) 
b) \(\frac {∂ϕ}{∂y} = \frac {df}{dy}\) 
c) \(\frac {∂ϕ}{∂x}\) = – V\(_∞^2 \frac {df}{dx}\) 
d) \(\frac {∂ϕ}{∂x} = \frac {dV_∞}{dx}\) 
a
\(\frac {df}{dx} = \frac {v^{‘}}{V_∞ + u^{‘}}\) = tanθ
Since it is a thin airfoil, the perturbation vector u‘ is very small in comparison to the freestream velocity V∞, resulting in \(\frac {df}{dx} = \frac {v^{‘}}{V_∞}\) = θ (Where tanθ ~ θ for small angles). Expressing the perturbation v‘ in terms of velocity potential we get
v‘ = \(\frac {∂ϕ}{∂x}\) 
Substituting this in the above equation:
\(\frac {df}{dx} = \frac {\frac {∂ϕ}{∂x}}{V_∞}\) = θ
\(\frac {∂ϕ}{∂x}\) = V∞ \(\frac {df}{dx}\) 
2. Which of these is the linearized perturbation velocity potential equation over a thin airfoil in a subsonic compressible flow?
a) β2(ϕxx + ϕyy) = 0
b) ϕxx + ϕyy = 0
c) β2ϕxx + ϕyy = 0
d) β2ϕxx + ϕxy = 0
c
β2ϕxx + ϕyy = 0
In this equation the perturbations are assumed to be small with the value of β = \(\sqrt {1 – M_∞^{2}} \).
3. Which of the equations governs the linearized incompressible flow over an airfoil at subsonic velocity using transformed coordinate system?
a) Laplace’s equation
b) Euler’s equation
c) Navier – Stokes equation
d) Cauchy’s equation
a
ϕξξ + ϕηη = 0
This is the Laplace equation representing the incompressible flow in a linearized form.
4. The shape of the airfoil in both (x, y) and transformed (ξ, η) space are different.
a) True
b) False
b
5. What does the Prandtl – Glauert rule relate?
a) Shape of airfoil in transformed spaces
b) Incompressible flow to the compressible flow for same airfoil
c) Coefficient of lift to coefficient of pressure
d) Coefficient of drag to coefficient of pressure
b
Cp = \(\frac {C_{p0}}{\sqrt {1 – M_∞^{2}}}\), Cl = \(\frac {C_{l0}}{\sqrt {1 – M_∞^{2}}}\), Cd = \(\frac {C_{d0}}{\sqrt {1 – M_∞^{2}}}\) 
This equation relates the pressure/lift/drag coefficient in incompressible flow Cp0 to the pressure/lift/drag coefficient in compressible flow (Cp) for a two – dimensional airfoil with the same profile.
6. Linearized theory is applicable for transonic regions as well.
a) True
b) False
b
Cl = \(\frac {C_{l0}}{\sqrt {1 – M_∞^{2}}}\), Cd = \(\frac {C_{d0}}{\sqrt {1 – M_∞^{2}}}\) 
7. For a subsonic flow, how does the coefficient of pressure vary with increasing Mach number?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains same
d) First increases, then decreases
a
Cp ∝ \(\frac {1}{\sqrt {1 – M_∞^{2}}}\) 
8. Up to which Mach number is Prandtl – Glauert rule applicable for subsonic flow?
a) 1
b) 0.5
c) 0.8
d) 0.65
c
