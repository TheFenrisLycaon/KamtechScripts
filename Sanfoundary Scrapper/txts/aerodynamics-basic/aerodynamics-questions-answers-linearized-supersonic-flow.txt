3. For an airfoil kept at supersonic flow, how does the coefficient of pressure vary with an increase in Mach number?

b) Decreases
c) Remains same
d) First increases, then decreases
b
4. What is the coefficient of lift according to the linearized theory over a flat plate kept at an inclination of 4 degrees having freestream Mach number of 3?
a) 0.0987
b) 1.231
c) 0.857
d) 1.362
a
According to the linearized theory, the coefficient of lift over a flat plate is given by:
cl = \(\frac {4∝}{\sqrt {M_∞^2 – 1}}\) 
Substituting the values we get
cl = \(\frac { 4× 0.0698}{\sqrt {9 – 1}} = \frac {0.2792}{2.8284}\)0.0987

a) True
b) False
b
6. For a biconvex airfoil, what sign convention is used for the value of θ while computing the coefficient of pressure?

b) Positive for upper and negative for lower surface
c) Positive for rearward and negative for forward surface
d) Positive for lower and negative for upper surface
a
7. For a thin airfoil kept at a supersonic flow of Mach number 3 at an inclination of 2 degrees, what is the coefficient of pressure?
a) 0.47

c) 1.78
d) 2.83
d
For the supersonic flow, the linearized coefficient of pressure for small inclinations is given by:
