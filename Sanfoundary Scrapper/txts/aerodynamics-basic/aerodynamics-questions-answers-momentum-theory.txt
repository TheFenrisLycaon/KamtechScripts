1. Who developed the momentum theory?
a) Daniel Bernoulli
b) Ludwig Prandtl
c) Osborne Reynolds
d) W.J.M. Rankine
d
2. For momentum theory analysis, what is rotor modelled as?
a) Thin actuator disk
b) Thick actuator disk
c) Angled blade
d) Two dimensional airfoil
a
3. The actual induced power loss result is less than the momentum theory result.
a) True
b) False
b
4. What is the formula for induced velocity for a helicopter while it hovers?
a) vh=\(\frac {T}{2\rho A}\) 
b) vh=\(\sqrt {\frac {T}{2\rho A}}\) 
c) vh=\(\frac {T^2}{\rho A}\) 
d) vh=2ρAT
b
T=2ρAvh2
Which is rearranged to obtain the induced velocity:
vh=\(\sqrt {\frac {T}{2\rho A}}\) 
Where, T is the total thrust
A is area of actuator disk
vh is induced velocity at rotor disk.
5. In order to increase the hovering efficiency, which parameter must be taken care of?
a) High power by thrust ratio
b) High thrust by area ratio
c) Low induced drag
d) High rotor tip speed
a
\(\frac {P}{T}=\sqrt {\frac {T}{2\rho A}}\) 
Thus, for low inflow velocity and low induced power loss, air must be accelerated through the rotor by virtue of pressure difference. For improving hovering efficiency, the value of P/T must be small thus improving fuel efficiency and decreasing engine’s weight.
6. Disk loading affects the hovering efficiency.
a) True
b) False
a
7. What is the ideal range of disk loading for high hover performance?
a) 10-100 \(\frac {N}{m^2}\) 
b) 100-500 \(\frac {N}{m^2}\) 
c) 1000-4000 \(\frac {N}{m^2}\) 
d) 5000-10,000 \(\frac {N}{m^2}\) 
b
8. Which of these is not an assumption made while formulating momentum theory for hover and clib of a helicopter?
a) Blade is modeled as an actuator disk
b) Non-uniform loading over the disk
c) Smooth slipstream
d) Slipstream rotation velocity is negligible
b
9. The momentum conservation equation for a helicopter in climb state is independent of which term?
a) Climb velocity
b) Induced velocity
c) Wake velocity
d) Mass flux
a
T=\(\dot {m}\)(V+w)-\(\dot {m}\)V
T=\(\dot {m}\)w
Where, V is the climb velocity
w is the induced velocity in the wake region
T is the thrust
\(\dot {m}\) is mass flux
On observing the equation, we see that the momentum equation is independent of the climb velocity.
10. What is the relation between the induced velocity in far wake region (w) and that at the rotor disk (v) for hovering condition?
a) w=v
b) w=v2
c) w=2v
d) w=v/2
c
T=\(\dot {m}\)w
Which can be rearranged as:
\(\frac {T}{\dot {m}}\)=w (equation 1)
And the energy equation is given by:
Tv=\(\frac {1}{2}\dot {m}\) 
Which is rearranges as:
\(\frac {T}{\dot {m}}=\frac {1}{2}\)vw2 (equation 2)
On equating equation 1 and 2 we get w=2v
Thus, the induced velocity in the wake region is twice that of the velocity at the rotor disk.
11. How is induced velocity in far wake region and actuator disk related in climb condition?
a) w=√v
b) w=v2
c) w=2v
d) w=3v
c
T=\(\dot {m}\)(V+w)-\(\dot {m}\)V=\(\dot {m}\)w
And the energy equation for climb condition rotor is given by:
T(V+v)=\(\frac {1}{2}\dot {m}\)(V+w)2–\(\frac {1}{2}\dot {m}\)(V)2=\(\frac {1}{2}\dot {m}\)w(w+2V)
On rearranging and eliminating T/\(\dot {m}\) term, we get w=2v which is similar to the condition for hovering helicopter. Thus, the induced velocity in the wake region is twice that of the velocity at the rotor disk.
