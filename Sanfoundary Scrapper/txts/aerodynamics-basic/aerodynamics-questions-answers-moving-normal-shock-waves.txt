1. What happens when the shock wave propagates in the opposite direction with the same magnitude as wave velocity?
a) Velocity increases
b) Velocity decreases
c) Appears stationary
d) Becomes sonic
c
2. What happens when normal shock wave propagates into laboratory facility?
a) Induces gas ahead of it
b) Induces gas behind it
c) Leaves a small area of vacuum behind it
d) Leaves a small area of vacuum ahead of it
b
3. The flow properties of the moving wave depends on which property/properties?
a) Direction
b) Time
c) Both direction and time
d) Temperature
c
4. Shock tube is an application of steady motion of the shock waves.
a) True
b) False
b
5. What is the continuity equation for a moving shock wave?
a) ρ1W = ρ2up
b) ρ1W = ρ2(W – up)
c) ρ1(W + up) = ρ2up
d) ρ1W = ρ2(W + up)
b
ρ1u1 = ρ2u2
Where, subscripts 1 and 2 are the sections behind and ahead of the shock wave. The above formula is valid only for stationary wave. For a moving wave, there is a induced gas formation behind the shock wave resulting in (W – up) being the velocity behind the shock wave which is relative to the wave, and W is the velocity of the gas ahead of the shock wave. Thus, the continuity equation becomes:
ρ1W = ρ2(W – up)
up is the velocity of induced mass motion due to the gas
W is the velocity of the normal shock wave.
6. Hugoniot equation is physically dependent on whether the shock wave is stationary or moving.
a) True
b) False
b
e2 – e1 = \( \frac {p_1 + p_2}{2}\)(v1 – v2)
This is derived from the three governing equations – Continuity, momentum and energy equations for a moving shock wave. This equation gives idea of how the thermodynamic variables such as energy, pressure changes across the normal shock wave. It is not dependent on whether the shock wave is stationary or not.
7. Which of these is the governing parameters for change across shock wave when it is moving?
a) Mach number
b) Density
c) Pressure ratio
d) Velocity ratio
c
\( \frac {T_2}{T_1} = \frac {p_2}{p_1} \Bigg ( \frac {\frac {γ + 1}{γ – 1} + \frac {p_2}{p_1}}{1 + \frac {γ + 1}{γ – 1} \frac {p_2}{p_1}} \Bigg )\) 
\( \frac {\rho _2}{\rho _1} = \frac {1 + \frac {γ + 1}{γ – 1} \frac {p_2}{p_1}}{\frac {γ + 1}{γ – 1} + \frac {p_2}{p_1}}\) 
8. If the wave velocity is 900 m/s and the density ratio across the shock wave is 0.6, then what is the value of velocity of induced mass motion behind the wave?
a) 400 m/s
b) 360 m/s
c) 180 m/s
d) 980 m/s
b
For a moving shock wave that propagates into a stagnant gas, it induces a mas motion of velocity up.
This velocity is given by the relation:
up = W\(\big (\)1 – \( \frac {\rho _2}{\rho _1} \big ) \) 
Substituting the values:
up = 900(1 – 0.6) = 360 m/s
9. How is total enthalpy related in a stationary shock wave?
a) Constant
b) h2 > h1
c) h2 < h1
d) h02 < h01
a
10. What is the temperature ratio across a moving shock wave in ambient air if the pressure ratio is 8.5?
a) 1.43
b) 2.37
c) 4.21
d) 3.82
b
The temperature ratio across a moving shock wave is given by:
\( \frac {T_2}{T_1} = \frac {p_2}{p_1} \Bigg ( \frac {\frac {γ + 1}{γ – 1} + \frac {p_2}{p_1}}{1 + \frac {γ + 1}{γ – 1} \frac {p_2}{p_1}} \Bigg )\) 
Substituting the values, we get:
\( \frac {T_2}{T_1}\) = 8.5\( \Bigg ( \frac {\frac {1.4 + 1}{1.4 – 1} + 8.5}{1 + \frac {1.4 + 1}{1.4 – 1} \times 8.5} \Bigg )\) = 8.5\( \Bigg ( \frac {\frac {2.4}{0.4} + 8.5}{1 + \frac {2.4}{0.4} \times 8.5} \Bigg ) \) 
\( \frac {T_2}{T_1}\) = 8.5\(\big ( \frac {14.5}{52} \big ) \) = 2.37
