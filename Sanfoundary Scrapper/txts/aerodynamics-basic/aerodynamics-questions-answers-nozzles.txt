1. For a flow in a duct, what is Mach number a function of?
a) Local duct area to sonic throat area
b) Sonic throat area to local duct area
c) Local duct area to convergent duct area
d) Local duct area to divergent duct area
a
M = f(A/A*)
2. In the area – Mach relation A < A* or A ≥ A*.
a) True
b) False
b
3. The area – Mach number relation yields how many solution(s) for a given Mach number?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 0
b
4. What happens in case of a choked flow?
a) When flow becomes supersonic at the throat
b) When flow is sonic and mass flow remains constant at the throat despite reducing exit pressure
c) When the exit pressure is reduced to a point where the flow becomes subsonic at throat
d) Normal shock is created at the inlet of the nozzle
b
5. For a nozzle with the following data \(\frac {A_e}{A_t}\) = 1.616, P01 = 1 atm, Pe = 0.947 atm, what is the the Mach number at the throat of the nozzle?
a) 0.25
b) 0.50
c) 0.75
d) 0.58
b
P01 = P0e = 1atm
\(\frac {P_{0e}}{P_e} = \frac {1}{0.947}\) = 1.056
From the isentropic table:
For \(\frac {P_{0e}}{P_e}\) = 1.056, we get Mach number as Me = 0.28
For Me = 0.28, \(\frac {A_e}{A^*}\) = 2.166 (From the gas table)
\(\frac {A_t}{A^*} = \frac {\frac {A_t}{A_e }}{\frac {A^*}{A_e }} = \frac {2.166}{1.616}\) = 1.34
For \(\frac {A_t}{A^*}\) = 1.34, we get Mt = 0.5
6. If the given conditions for a nozzle are P01 = 1 atm, Pe = 0.3143 atm, then what is the ratio of exit area to throat area?
a) 1.15
b) 1.5
c) 1.25
d) 1.115
d
To calculate – \(\frac {A_e}{A^*}\) 
Stagnation pressures remain same P01 = P0e
\(\frac {P_{0e}}{P_e} = \frac {1}{0.3143}\) = 3.182
For \(\frac {P_{0e}}{P_e}\) = 3.182 we get Me = 1.4 (Using gas table)
For Me = 1.4, we get \(\frac {A_e}{A^*}\) = 1.115 (Using gas table)
7. Which of this conditions is necessary to achieve flow in a nozzle?
a) \(\frac {P_e}{P_0}\) < 1
b) \(\frac {P_e}{P_0}\) > 1
c) \(\frac {P_e}{P_0}\) = 1
d) \(\frac {P_e}{P_0}\) = 0
a
Thus the condition to achieve an accelerated flow inside a nozzle is: \(\frac {P_e}{P_0}\) < 1
8. What is the exit Mach number if the convergent nozzle is choked?
a) 0
b) 1
c) 0.5
d) 1.5
b
9. In case of the formation of shock in the divergent section of a C – D nozzle, the flow remains isentropic.
a) True
b) False
b
10. What happens to the mass flow rate if the reservoir pressure is doubled?
a) Doubled
b) Remains same
c) Becomes half
d) Becomes one – fourth
a
\(\dot {m} ∝ \frac {p_0 A^*}{\sqrt {T_0}} \) 
Thus, when the resrvoic pressure is doubled, the mass flow rate through the nozzle also doubles as it is directly proportional to it.
11. Which of these conditions result in underexpanded nozzle?
a) Pe = Pa
b) Pe > Pa
c) Pe < Pa
d) Pe << Pa
b
12. In which of these conditions there’s no formation of shock wave inside a convergent – divergent nozzle?
a) Overexpanded
b) Underexpanded
c) Fully expanded
d) Fully underexpanded
c
