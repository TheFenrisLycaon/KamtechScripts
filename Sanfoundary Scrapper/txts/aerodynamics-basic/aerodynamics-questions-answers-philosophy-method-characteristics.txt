a
ui + 1,j = ui,j + \(\frac {∂P}{∂x_{i,j}}\) ∆x + \(\frac {∂^2 P}{∂x^{2}_{i,j}} \frac {∆x^{2}}{2} + \frac {∂^3 P}{∂x^{3}_{i,j}} \frac {∆x^{3}}{3}\) + ⋯.
3. The numerical solution results in certain amount of truncation error.
a) True
b) False
a
4. What causes ‘round off’ error in numerical solution?
a) Finite grid points
b) Rounding number to a significant figure
c) Solving nonlinear equation
d) Incoherent boundary conditions
b
5. Which of these is the compatibility equation along C– characteristic line?
a) du + \(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = 0
b) du – \(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = 0
c) \(\frac {dpu}{ρa}\) = 0
d) \(\frac {du}{ρa}\) = 0
b
du – \(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = 0
The compatibility equation along C+ line is:

6. What is the slope of the right running wave characteristic equation?
a) u + a
b) u – a
c) 2u
d) 2a
a
7. The Riemann invariants are constant along the characteristic line.
a) True
b) False
a
J+ = u + ∫\(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = const
J– = u – ∫\(\frac {dp}{ρa}\) = const
J+ and J– are hence constant along the characteristic lines.
