10. If a cone with half angle 30.2 degrees is kept in a flow at Mach number 3.5, then what is the value of Mach number downstream of the shockwave?
a) 1.110
b) 2.482
c) 1.648
d) 3.45
c
From the θ – β – M curve,
For M1 = 3.5 and θ = 30.2°, the value of β is 48°
Normal component of M1 is Mn1 = M1 sinβ = 3.5 × sin48 = 2.60
From the normal shock table (gas table), for Mn1 = 2.6, we get
\(\frac {P_{02}}{P_{01}}\) = 0.4601 and Mn2 = 0.5039
Thus the Mach number downstream of the shock wave is
M2 = \(\frac {M_{n2}}{sin⁡(β – θ)} = \frac {0.5039}{sin⁡(48 – 30.2)}\) = 1.648
