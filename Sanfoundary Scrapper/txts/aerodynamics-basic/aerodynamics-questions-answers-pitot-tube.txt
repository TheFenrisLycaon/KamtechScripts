b) Static
c) Dynamic
d) Absolute
b
3. How does the pitot tube help in measuring the airspeed?

b) Using velocity
c) Using mach number
d) Using the pressure difference
d
4. The instrument which combines both the static and total pressure is _______
a) Dynamic probe
b) Static probe
c) Pitot static probe
d) Stagnation probe
c
5. The dynamic pressure can be used in all flows from incompressible to hypersonic.
a) True
b) False
a
                   q=0.5*ρ*V2.
6. The dynamic pressure can be given by ____________
a) difference of total and static pressure
b) sum of total and static pressure
c) product of total and static pressure
d) double of total and static pressure
a
   Therefore, the dynamic pressure (q)= total pressure (p0)- static pressure (p1). 
7. The pressure difference (p0-p1) holds good only for incompressible flow.
a) True
b) False
a

a) total pressure is not equal to static pressure
b) total pressure is equal to static pressure
c) 0
d) infinity
b
9. An aircraft is flying at cruise level with a velocity of 110m/s at an altitude of 10 km and the dynamic pressure is 5.43kN/m2. Now assume the aircraft is flying is at sea level with a speed of 65m/s and the same dynamic pressure. In the above data, the velocity 65m/s refers to __________
