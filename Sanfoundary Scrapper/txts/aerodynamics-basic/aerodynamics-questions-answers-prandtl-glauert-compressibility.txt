1. Prandtl – Glauert compressibility correction is applied for finding airfoil properties at low speed.
a) True
b) False
b
2. For which of thee flows is Prandtl – Glauert compressibility correction is effective?
a) Subsonic flow
b) Sonic flow
c) Supersonic flow
d) Hypersonic flow
a
3. Prandtl – Glauert compressibility correction is based on which of the following methods?
a) Velocity potential equation
b) Energy equation
c) Momentum equation
d) Continuity equation
a
(1 – M\(_∞^2\))\(\frac {∂^2 \hat {ϕ}}{∂x^2} + \frac {∂^2 \hat {ϕ}}{∂y^2}\) = 0
Where, ϕ is the velocity potential. It is a combination of continuity, momentum and energy equation. The above equation is only applicable for thin bodies
\(\hat {ϕ}\) is perturbation velocity potential which is a non linear equation.
4. For which of these conditions is Prandtl – Glauert compressibility equation valid?
a) Thick airfoil, small angle of attack
b) Thick airfoil, large angle of attack
c) Thin airfoil, large angle of attack
d) Thin airfoil, small angle of attack
d
5. What is the relation between linearized pressure coefficient for compressible Cp and incompressible flow Cp,0?
a) Cp = βCp,0
b) Cp = \(\frac {C_{p.0}}{β}\) 
c) Cp = \(\frac {β}{C_{p.0}}\) 
d) Cp = β2Cp,0
b
Cp =  –\(\frac {2\hat {u}}{V_∞}\) 
Where, \(\hat {u} = \frac {∂\hat {ϕ}}{∂x}\) is the velocity perturbation
Cp =  –\(\frac {2}{V_∞} \frac {∂\hat {ϕ}}{∂x}\) 
\(\frac {∂\hat {ϕ}}{∂x} =  -\frac {1}{β} \frac {∂\bar {ϕ}}{∂ξ}\) 
Where, \(\bar {ϕ}\) is the perturbation velocity for incompressible flow
β = \(\sqrt {1 – M_∞^2}\) 
Cp =  –\(\frac {2}{V_∞} \frac {1}{β} \frac {∂\bar {ϕ}}{∂ξ} = \frac {C_{p.0}}{β}\) 
This relation helps in finding out the coefficient of pressure for a compressible flow using the incompressible pressure coefficient value.
6. If the lift coefficient for an aircraft at low speed is 0.45, then what is the value of the coefficient of drag at Mach number 0.7?
a) 0.51
b) 0.49
c) 0.63
d) 0.71
c
The coefficient of lift for compressible and incompressible flow are related by the following relation:
cl = \(\frac {c_{l.0}}{β} = \frac {c_{l.0}}{\sqrt {1 – M_∞^2}} = \frac {0.45}{\sqrt {1 – 0.7^2}}\) 
cl = \(\frac {0.45}{\sqrt {0.51}}\) = 0.63
