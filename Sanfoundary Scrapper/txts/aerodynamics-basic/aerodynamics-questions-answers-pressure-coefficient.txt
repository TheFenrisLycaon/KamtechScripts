1. Coefficient of pressure is a ________
a) dimensional quantity
b) dimensionless quantity
c) negligible value
d) cannot be determined
b
2. For incompressible flow, Cp is expressed only in terms of ____________
a) pressure
b) density
c) temperature
d) velocity
d
                         P1+0.5*ρ*V12 = P2+0.5*ρ*V22
From here we get, P2-P1 = 0.5*ρ (V12– V22)
Hence, Cp = (P2-P1)/q
Where q-dynamic pressure
On solving the above equation we get, Cp = 1 – (V2/ V1)2.
3. The highest value of Cp is given at ________
a) end points
b) stagnation point
c) everywhere in the flow field
d) at boundaries
b
Gives the value of the coefficient of pressure as 1. This is true only for incompressible flow. Stagnation point gives the highest value of the coefficient of pressure.
4. For compressible flow, the value of Cp at stagnation point is __________
a) 0
b) negative
c) infinity
d) greater than 1
d
5. The value of Cp for compressible flow can be given as ___________
a) Cp = P2-P1
b) Cp = 0
c) Cp = (P2-P1) /q
d) Cp = 0.5*ρ*V12
d
6. If the value of Cp=1, then the local pressure can be given as ___________
a) P = Pfreestream + q
b) P = 0.5*ρ*V12
c) P = Pfreestream
d) P = 0
a
7. Ram is working on an experiment. He has a beaker in which fluid is moving at a very high velocity. He wants to calculate the relative pressure at each and every point of the flow. Which of the following will help him to do so?

d) no significance
a
13. The aspect ratio (AR) is given by __________
a) b/s
b) s/b
c) b2/s
d) s3/b
c
AR = b2/S where b is the wing span and S is the wing area.
14. Pressure is _____ proportional to altitude.
a) inversely
b) directly
c) no relation
d) equal
a
15. The pressure and temperature are ________
