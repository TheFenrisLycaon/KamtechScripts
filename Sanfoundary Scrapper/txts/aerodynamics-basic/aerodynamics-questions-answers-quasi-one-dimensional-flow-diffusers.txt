1. What is the role of the diffuser?
a) Increase the flow velocity after test section
b) Decrease the flow velocity after test section
c) Increase the flow velocity inside test section
d) Decrease the flow velocity inside the test section
b
2. How is flow deaccelerated In the diffuser?
a) Isentropic compression
b) Isentropic expansion
c) Adiabatic compression
d) Adiabatic expansion
a
3. Which of these properties remain constant in the ideal isentropic supersonic diffuser?
a) Total pressure
b) Velocity
c) Mach number
d) Mass flow
a
4. Why can’t build an ideal supersonic diffuser with no total pressure losses?
a) Presence of shock waves
b) Varying cross – sectional area
c) Varying throat area
d) Choked flow
a

6. Oblique shock diffuser has a better pressure recovery than a normal shock diffuser.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Which of these phenomena attenuates the advantages of greater pressure recovery in an oblique shock diffuser?
a) Abrupt change of convergent – divergent sections
b) Shock wave interaction with walls
c) Isentropic flow
d) Presence of normal shock
b
 In real life, oblique shock diffusers have viscous flow. The presence of shock waves inside the diffuser leads to interaction with the viscous boundary layer of the diffuser walls which leads to additional pressure losses. There’s also friction involved which makes oblique shock diffusers far from the ideal diffusers which have no total pressure losses.
8. Why is the diffuser throat area greater than the nozzle throat area?
a) To reduce speed
b) To maintain constant mass flow rate
c) Rise in entropy within diffuser
d) Rise in entropy within nozzle
c
9. What is the diffuser efficiency for supersonic flow?
a) ηD = 1
b) ηD > 1
c) ηD < 1
d) ηD = 1/2
b
10. What is the diffuser efficiency of a normal shock diffuser?
a) 1
b) 0
c) Inifinty
d) \(\frac {1}{2}\) 
a
ηD = \(\frac {(\frac {p_{d_0}}{p_0})_{actual}}{(\frac {p_{0_2}}{p_{01}} )_{normal \, shock \, at \, M_e}}\) 
The numerator will be equal to the denominator for a normal shock diffuser, hence the efficiency is one. For subsonic flow, the siffuder’s performance is lower resulting in efficiency which is less than unity. And for the hypersonic flow the efficiency is greater than unity since it has a better shock recovery.
11. What is the entropy relation between the entry and exit of an actual diffuser?
a) s1 = s2
b) s1 > s2
c) s1 < s2
d) s1 s2 = 1
c
12. What happens if the second throat area is larger than the starting value when the wind tunnel starts and the reservoir pressure value is opened?
a) Normal shock is swallowed by diffuser
b) Normal shock remains upstream of diffuser
c) Throat area has no effect
d) Normal shock is generated at the inlet
a
If the throat area of the diffuser is not large enough, the normal shock remains upstream of the diffuser and the wind tunnel is unable to start properly. On the other hand, when the second throat area is larger than the starting value, the normal shock is able to pass through the diffuser/swallowed by the diffuser resulting in proper functioning of the wind tunnel.
13. Why is a variable – geometry diffuser used?
a) Ease in manufacturing
b) Higher efficiency
c) More mass flow rate
d) Inexpensive
b
Variable – geometry diffuser on the other hand can vary the throat area by hydraulic or mechanical means. The second throat area at the start of the operation is kept high enough so that the normal shock is able to pass through the diffuser and there is no starting problem. Once the wind tunnel starts working, its throat area is reduced so that it operates with a higher efficiency.
