1. What is the velocity behind a reflected shock wave?
a) Equal to the wave velocity
b) Zero
c) Less than the wave velocity
d) More than the wave velocity
b
2. What is a wave diagram?
a) Plot of wave motion between t and x
b) Plot of reflected wave motion between t and x
c) Diagram of shock creation inside shock tube
d) Plot of wave motion between x and t
a
3. What is the relation between velocity of the wave and reflected shock wave?
a) WR = W
b) WR < W
c) WR > W
d) WR × W = ∞
b
4. What is the continuity equation for a reflected shock wave?
a) ρ1W = ρ5up
b) ρ1W = ρ2(W – up)
c) ρ2(WR + up) = ρ5WR
d) ρ1W = ρ5(W + up)
c
ρ1u1 = ρ2u2
Where, subscripts 1 and 2 are the sections behind and ahead of the shock wave. This above formula is valid only for stationary wave. For a reflected unsteady shock wave, the velocity ahead of the shock relative to wave is WR + up and the velocity behind the shock relative to the wave is WR. Thus, the continuity equation becomes:
ρ2(WR + up) = ρ5WR
5. If the Mach number of the moving shock wave relative to the laboratory Ms = 1.25 then what is the Mach number of the reflected shock wave in a calorically perfect gas?
a) 1.2331
b) 1.4821
c) 1.5671
d) 1.1102
a
The relation between Ms and MR is:
\(\frac {M_R}{M_R ^2 – 1} = \frac {M_s}{M_s ^2 – 1} \sqrt {1 + \frac {2(γ – 1)}{(γ + 1)^2}(M_s^2 – 1)\big (γ + \frac {1}{M_s ^2} \big )}\) 
Substituting the values we get
\(\frac {M_R}{M_R ^2 – 1} = \frac {1.25}{1.25^2 – 1}\sqrt {1 + \frac {2(1.4 – 1)}{(1.4 + 1)^2}  (1.25^2 – 1)\big (1.4 + \frac {1}{1.25^2} \big )} \) 
\(\frac {M_R}{M_R ^2 – 1} = \frac {1.25}{1.25^2 – 1}\sqrt {1 + \frac {2(1.4 – 1)}{(1.4 + 1)^2}  (1.25^2 – 1)\big (1.4 + \frac {1}{1.25^2} \big )} \) 
\(\frac {M_R}{M_R ^2 – 1}\) = 2.20\(\sqrt {1 + \frac {0.8}{5.76}  (0.5625)(2.04)}\) = 2.3689
MR = 2.3689 MR2 – 2.3689MR
On solving the quadratic equation we get two results:
MR = 1.2331, – 0.81
Negative values of Mach number is not possible, hence MR = 1.2331
6. What is the Mach number of the reflected wave if the velocity of the reflected wave is 600 m/s, velocity of induced mass motion is 350 m/s and the speed of air is 400 m/s?
a) 3.5
b) 2.375
c) 1.25
d) 3.561
b
The incident shock wave propagates into the gas ahead of it towards the wall with Mach number Ms which is reflected into the gas ahead of it with Mach number MR. This is given by the formula:
MR = \(\frac {W_R + u_p}{a_2}\) 
Substituting the values, we get:
MR = \(\frac {600 + 350}{400}\) = 2.375
