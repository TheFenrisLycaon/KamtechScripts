b) Divergent
c) Convergent-Divergent
d) Divergent-Convergent
c
2. What is the shortcoming of analysing flow properties using quasi-one-dimensional analysis?
a) Time consuming
b) Inaccurate
c) No information on wall contours of nozzle
d) Unable to predict all the flow properties
c
3. What is the portion of the nozzle called where the angle between the tangent to the wall and horizontal decreases?
a) Divergent section
b) Expansion section
c) Straightening section
d) Convergen section
c
4. Characteristic lines are those lines in the flow field where the flow variables cannot be determined.
a) True
b) False
a
5. How many characteristic line/lines can pass through a point P in a streamline?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
\((\frac {dy}{dx})\)char = tan⁡(θ ± μ)
Where, θ is the angle made between the tangent to the point P and horizontal
μ is local Mach angle = sin-1(1/M)
Thus the two characteristic lines have slope tan⁡(θ + μ) and tan⁡(θ – μ). The one which is inclined above the streamline is labelled as C+ and the characteristic line inclined below the streamline is C–.
6. Which of these steps is not involved in method of characteristics for supersonic nozzle design?
a) Determining characteristic lines
b) Determining compatibility equations for characteristic line
c) Solving compatibility equation point by point
d) Neglect the internal points
d
7. What is the proses of applying method of characteristic known as?
a) Unit process
b) Numerical process
c) Characteristics formulation
d) Computation process
a
8. At which point is the initial data taken for nozzle flow?
a) Downstream of the limiting characteristic
b) Upstream of the limiting characteristic
c) Expansion region
d) Straightening section
a
9. Lines originating after limiting line intersect the sonic line.
a) True
b) False
b
10. If we know the location and flow properties of internal points 1 and 2, then what is the value of local streamline direction θ3 for point 3 which lies at the intersection of characteristic lines?
a) θ3 = \(\frac {1}{2}\)[(K–)1 + (K+)2] 
b) θ3 = [(K–)1 + (K+)2 ] 
c) θ3 = \(\frac {1}{2}\)[(K–)1 – (K+)2] 
d) θ3 = [(K–)1 – (K+)2] 
a
Thus, K–1 = K–3 = θ1 + ν1 since it lies along the same characteristic line C+. Similarly, K+2 = K+3 = θ2 – ν2 because point 3 and 2 lie along the same characteristic line C–.
Solving for the following equation:
K–3 = θ1 + ν1
K+3 = θ2 – ν2
We get,
θ3 = \(\frac {1}{2}\)[(K–)1 + (K+)2]
