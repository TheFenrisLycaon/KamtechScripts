b) Test section
c) Diffuser
d) Test model

6. The nozzle throat area is same as the diffuser throat area.
a) True
b) False
b
\(\dot {m_1} = \dot {m_2}\) 
ρ1u1A1t = ρ2 u2A1t
But due to the presence of shock waves inside the diffuser, the density and the flow velocity are not same. (ρ1≠ρ2, u1≠u2). This means that the throat areas are also not same.
7. What is the relation between the nozzle A1t and diffuser throat area A2t in the supersonic wind tunnel?
a) At2 = At1
b) At2 > At1
c) At2 < At1
d) At2 At1 = 1
b
\(\frac {A_{t2}}{A_{t1}} = \frac {p_{01}}{p_{02}}\) 
Since in the diffuser section, the total pressure drops across oblique shock wave, thus p02 < p01. Hence the throat area of the diffuser is larger than the throat area of the nozzle.
8. In which scenario is the throat area of both the nozzle and diffuser the same?
a) Ideal isentropic diffuser
b) Ideal adiabatic diffuser
c) Ideal isobaric diffuser
d) Ideal Isochoric diffuser
a
\(\frac {A_{t2}}{A_{t1}} = \frac {p_{01}}{p_{02}}\) 
9. What is the ratio of throat area of diffuser to nozzle in supersonic wind tunnel with flow at Mach 2.7?
a) 0.4236
b) 0.8338
c) 2.36
d) 1.199
c
If we assume that there’s a normal shock present at the entrance of the diffuser, then using the gas table we can find the ratio of total pressures \(\frac {p_{01}}{p_{02}}\).
For M = 2.7, \(\frac {p_{02}}{p_{01}}\) = 0.4236
Using the relation beween the throat areas and total pressure we get
\(\frac {A_{t2}}{A_{t1}} = \frac {p_{01}}{p_{02}} = \frac {1}{0.4236}\) = 2.36
10. In how many categories is the supersonic wind tunnel classified into?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 6
