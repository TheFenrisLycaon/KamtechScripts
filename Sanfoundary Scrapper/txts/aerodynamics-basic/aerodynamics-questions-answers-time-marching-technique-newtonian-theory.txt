1. What is a Newtonian theory used for?
a) Finding lift coefficient over blunt body
b) Finding pressure coefficient over blunt body
c) Finding drag coefficient over sharp wedge
d) Finding pressure coefficient over cone
b
Cp = 2sin2θ
Where, the coefficient of pressure is given by:
Cp = \(\frac {1}{2} \frac {(p – p_∞)}{ρV^{2}}\) 
2. Newton theory is applicable for which of these flows?
a) Subsonic flow
b) Supersonic flow
c) Transonic flow
d) Hypersonic flow
d
3. What is the relation according to the Newton’s theory for hypersonic problems?
a) Cp = 2sinθ
b) Cp = 2sin2θ
c) Cp = cosθ
d) Cp = 2sinθcosθ
b
Cp = 2sin2θ
Where, θ is the local inclination angle of the surface with respect to the free stream velocity.
4. According to the Newtonian theory, which of these is preserved after the impact of the incident particles?
a) Normal momentum
b) Tangential momentum
c) Normal velocity
d) Tangential velocity
b
5. According to the Newtonian model for fluid flow, what is the coefficient of pressure at the rear of the surface while free stream flows horizontally towards it?
a) One
b) Zero
c) Infinity
d) 0.5
b
6. According to Newton’s theory, what happens to the lift to drag value with decreasing angle of attack of a flat plate?
a) Remains same
b) Increase monotonically
c) Decreases parabolically
d) Becomes zero with maximum angle of attack
b
\(\frac {L}{D}\) = cotα
On plotting the curve, as the angle of attack decreases, L/D ratio monotonically increases. Obviously this is a hypothetical condition as skin friction drag is not incorporated in this.
7. At what angle does the coefficient of lift over a flat plate become maximum?
a) 66.6 deg
b) 54.7 deg
c) 33.3 deg
d) 90 deg
b
cl = 2sin3α
This value is maximum for α = 54.7 degrees.
8. What is the formula for coefficient of drag over a circular cylinder at hypersonic speed?
a) cd = \(\frac {D}{q_∞ S}\) 
b) cd = \(\frac {D}{2q_∞ S}\) 
c) cd = \(\frac {2D}{q_∞ S}\) 
d) cd = Dq∞S
a
cd = \(\frac {D}{q_∞ S}\) 
Where, S = 2R is the cross – sectional area and R is the radius of the cylinder
cd = \(\frac {4}{3}\) which is obtained using Newton’s theory.
9. Coefficient of drag over a sphere at hypersonic speed is dependent on the Mach number.
a) True
b) False
b
cd = \(\frac {D}{q_∞ S}\) 
Where, S = πR2 (R being the radius of the sphere)
This results in the value of cd being 1. Clearly, this result is independent of the Mach number of the flow. The only condition is that the Mach number should be in the range of hypersonic regime for this result to be valid.
10. What is the pressure exerted by the incoming stream of particles on an inclined flat plate based on Newton’s theory?
a) \(\frac {F}{A}\) = ρV\(_∞^2\)sin2θ
b) \(\frac {F}{A}\) = ρV∞sin2θ
c) \(\frac {F}{A}\) = ρV\(_∞^2\)cos2θ
d) \(\frac {F}{A}\) = ρV\(_∞^2\)sinθ
a
The rate of mass flow of the particles over the flat inclined plate with an area A is given by ρAV∞sinθ.
Thus the force is given by product of mass flux and velocity change.
(ρAV∞sinθ)(V∞sinθ) = ρAV\(_∞^2\)sin2θ = F
And since pressure is equal to force upon area, therefore it is \(\frac {F}{A}\) = ρV\(_∞^2\)sin2θ
11. Newton’s theory gives much more accurate results for 2 – dimensional shapes.
a) True
b) False
b
12. Which of these methods is not a local inclination method for computing pressure distribution?
a) Newtonian theory
b) Tangent wedge theory
c) Tangent cone theory
d) Oblique shock method
d
13. As a result of chemically reacting gas, which of these features differ compared to the ideal gas??
a) Pitching moment coefficient
b) Temperature
c) Drag
d) Lift
a
