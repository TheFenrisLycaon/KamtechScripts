1. How does the turbulent boundary layer vary with respect to the Reynolds number?
a) Rex–\(\frac {1}{5}\)
b) Rex–\(\frac {1}{4}\)
c) Rex–\(\frac {1}{2}\)
d) Rex-2
a
δ = \(\frac {0.37x}{Re_x^{-1/5}}\) 
Thus the turbulent boundary layer thickness varies as Rex-1/5 whereas in case of laminar flow, it varies as Rex-1/4.
2. What is the skin friction drag for an incompressible turbulent flow with Reynolds number =  1.5 × 107 over a flat plate?
a) 2.72 × 10-3
b) 5.41 × 10-3
c) 3.82 × 10-3
d) 2.91 × 10-3
a
The skin friction drag over a flat plate for an incompressible turbulent flow is given by:
Cf = \(\frac {0.074}{Re_c^{1/5}}\) 
Substituting the values,
Cf = \(\frac {0.074}{1.5 \times 10^{7^{1/5}}}  = \frac {0.074}{27.24}\) = 2.72 × 10-3
