1. For an irrotational flow having velocity potential ϕ = 2x + 3z2 – 4y2 + 8x2, the flow field satisfies continuity equation.
a) True
b) False
b
The velocity components u and v are calculated as follows:
u = –\(\frac {∂ϕ}{∂x} = -\frac {∂}{∂x}\)(2x + 3y – 4y2 + 8x2) = -2 – 16x
v = –\(\frac {∂ϕ}{∂y} = -\frac {∂}{∂y}\)(2x + 3y – 4y2 + 8x2) = -3 + 8y
The continuity equation is given by:
\(\frac {∂u}{∂x} + \frac {∂v}{∂y}\) = 0
Substituting the values of u and v,
\(\frac {∂}{∂x}\)(-2 – 16x) + \(\frac {∂}{∂y}\)(-3 + 8y) = -16 + 8 = -8
Since this is not equal to zero, hence continuity equation is not satisfied.
2. For an irrotational flow, what is the relation for the velocity potential?
a) V = ∇ × ϕ
b) V = ∇ϕ
c) V = -∇ × V
d) V = (∇ × V)ϕ
b
∇ × (∇ϕ) = 0
Thus, the velocity potential is describing as the scalar function ∇ϕ.
3. Which of these equations is satisfied by the velocity potential equation?
a) Laplace equation
b) Fano’s equation
c) Bernoulli’s equation
d) Rayleigh equation
a
u = –\(\frac {∂ϕ}{∂x}\), v = –\(\frac {∂ϕ}{∂y}\), w = –\(\frac {∂ϕ}{∂z}\) 
The continuity equation for three – dimensional flow is given by:
\(\frac {∂u}{∂x} + \frac {∂v}{∂y} + \frac {∂w}{∂z}\) = 0
Substituting the velocity components in the continuity equation, we get
\(\frac {∂}{∂x} \big ( – \frac {∂ϕ}{∂x} \big ) + \frac {∂}{∂y} \big ( – \frac {∂ϕ}{∂x} \big ) + \frac {∂}{∂z} \big ( – \frac {∂ϕ}{∂x} \big )\) = 0
\(\frac {∂^2 ϕ}{∂x} + \frac {∂^2 ϕ}{∂y} + \frac {∂^2 ϕ}{∂z}\) = 0
The above final equation is known as Laplace equation, thus velocity potential satisfies the Laplace equation.
4. If the velocity potential is given by ϕ = +2x2 – 4xy2 + \( \frac {8x^2}{y}\), then what is the value of velocity component in x – direction at point (2,1)?
a) 30 m/s
b) 15 m/s
c) 36 m/s
d) 24 m/s
c
Velocity component in x – direction is given by u = –\( \frac {∂ϕ}{∂x}\) 
u = –\( \frac {∂}{∂x} \big ( \)2x2 – 4xy2 + \( \frac {8x^2}{y} \big ) \) = 4x – 4y2 + \( \frac {16x}{y}\) 
For calculating the velocity component at point (2,1), we substitute these points in the above equation
u = 4(2) – 4(1)2 + \( \frac {16(2)}{(1)}\) = 8 – 4 + 32 = 36 m/s
5. What is the nature of the flow having a velocity potential?
a) Rotational
b) Irrotational
c) Inviscid
d) Viscous
b
6. If the Laplace equation is satisfied by the velocity potential, then the fluid flows.
a) True
b) False
a
Thus, the condition for the fluid to flow is:
\(\frac {∂^2 ϕ}{∂x} + \frac {∂^2 ϕ}{∂y} + \frac {∂^2 ϕ}{∂z}\) = 0
Or
∇2ϕ = 0
