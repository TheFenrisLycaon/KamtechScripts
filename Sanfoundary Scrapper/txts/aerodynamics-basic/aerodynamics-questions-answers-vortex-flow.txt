1. The free vortex flow forms _________
a) straight lines
b) concentric circles
c) parabola
d) hyperbola
b
2. The following figure is an example of ____________
a) source flow
b) sink flow
c) doublet
d) free vortex flow
d
3. Except at the origin where r=0, the vortex flow is ___________
a) rotational
b) laminar
c) irrotational
d) turbulent
c
4. The strength of the vortex flow can be given by ______________
a) Γ=2*pi*C
b) Γ=2*pi
c) Γ=-2*pi*C
d) Γ=0
c
Γ=2*pi*C where, C – constant and Γ is the strength of the vortex flow.
When Γ is positive, it means that vortex of positive strength rotates in the clockwise direction and vice versa.
