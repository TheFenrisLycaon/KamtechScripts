b) 1/100 of registered load
c) 1/500 of registered load
d) 1/200 of the registered load
a
2. Which of the following can be obtained through a tension test?
a) Colour
b) Heat treatment
c) Ultimate tensile strength
d) Conductivity
c
3. During tension testing, the material must be held in _____________ alignment.
a) normal
b) axial
c) parallel
d) diabolical
a
4. The extensometer can be attached anywhere to the specimen.
a) True
b) False
b
5. The elastic limit of a material is _____________
a) the least amount of stress that can be held without permanent deformation
b) highest stress a material can experience without permanent deformation
c) average stress experienced by material in its lifeline.
d) strain on material
b
6. In the tension testing experiment, while determining elastic limit, the increment, while the load is being increased, should not exceed ___________ % of the elastic limit in the ending.
a) 50
b) 7
c) 2
d) 3
d
7. The tension testing machine (crosshead) should not cross a speed of ___________ inch per inch of the gage length per minute until the yield point.
a) 1/11
b) 2
c) 1/16
d) 2/5
c
8. It is possible to determine the proof stress in a way in which ___________ is determined.
a) elastic limit
b) yield point
c) stress
d) strain
a
9. For a 4-inch gage length, crosshead speed of a machine should not exceed ___________ inch up to yield point.
a) 1/16
b) 1/4
c) 1/8
d) 1/6
b
For 4 inches, it is – \(\frac{1×4}{16}\) = 1/4 inch.
10. What does ‘A’ represent in the diagram?
a) Stress meter
b) Radius
c) Gage length
d) Diameter of center
d
11. A materials proof stress is the highest stress possible for it to tolerate without causing a permanent set of more than ___________ inch per inch the length of gage, after the total release of stress.
a) 5.1
b) 0.002
c) 0.0001
d) 0.1
c
12. Why must an accurate extensometer be used in reading a permanent set?
a) It is cheap
b) To obtain accuracy
c) It is radioactive
d) It is unnecessary
b
13. The proof stress of a material of 3 inches gage length is the highest stress it can withstand without a permanent set of above ___________ inch.
a) 0.0003
b) 0.21
c) 0.05
d) 0.004
a
0.0001×3 = 0.0003 inches.
Hence, it is 0.0003 inches.
14. A materials proof stress is also referred to as ___________
a) elastic limit
b) yield limit
c) proportional limit
d) set method
c
