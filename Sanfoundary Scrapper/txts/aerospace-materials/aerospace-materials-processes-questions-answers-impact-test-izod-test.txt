1. What is an impact test?
a) Fixing a specimen in the machine to be broken by weight or heavy pendulum
b) Indenting with the help of a diamond hammer
c) Rolling with steel
d) Dipping in a mixture of ethanol and carbon and checking indentation of a material
a
2. The impact tests can be used to _____________
a) find out the absolute value of a material
b) to determine the tensile strength of a material
c) compare two specimens of similar composition and tensile strength
d) to find the quantity of material
c
3. What is the principal use of the impact tests?
a) To determine ductility
b) To determine if the material has been subjected to heat treatment
c) To prevent material from corroding
d) To obtain absolute values
b
4. The impact test of a material determines the shock resistance.
a) True
b) False
b
5. On _________ materials, impact test cannot be conducted.
a) steel
b) solid
c) room temperature
d) extremely ductile
d
6. In an Izod test after the pendulum is released from a certain height, it hits the material at the __________ point of it’s path.
a) lowest
b) opposite
c) highest
d) sideways
a
7. What is the angle ‘A’ (notch) in the following figure of the Izod test specimen?
a) 60°
b) 30°
c) 45°
d) 90°
c
8. The impact test value of a material changes with material.
a) True
b) False
a
9. If in an old test, energy absorbed (obtained on the scale) is 34 J and cross-section area of the notch is 10×8 mm square. What is the impact strength of the material?
a) 34 J per mm square
b) 4.25 J per mm square
c) 0.425 J per mm square
d) 80 J per mm square
c
= \(\frac{34}{10×8}\) 
= 0.425 J per mm square.
