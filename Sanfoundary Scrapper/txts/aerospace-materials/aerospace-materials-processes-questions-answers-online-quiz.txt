d
4. There is often no choice between the two methods of determination of yield strength available, as it is predetermined.
a) True
b) False
b
5. What does length ‘AC’ in the diagram represent?
a) Yield gage
b) Yield strength
c) Set
d) Yield point
c
6. The extension under load method is easier to use in finding yield strength because ___________
a) no necessity to plot a curve
b) it is not easier
c) it is the only method available
d) randomness
a
7. The second part of specified extensions in the extensions under load method typically involves adding an elongation of ____ inch per inch of gage length.
a) 0.2
b) 2.02
c) 0.02
d) 0.002
d
8. If the expected yield strength of a material is 50,000 pounds per square inch and modulus of elasticity is 10,000, what is the normal elongation of the material?
a) 50,000,000 inch per inch gage length
b) 5 inch per inch gage length
