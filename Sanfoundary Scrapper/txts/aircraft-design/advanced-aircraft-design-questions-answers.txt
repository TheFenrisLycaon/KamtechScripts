c) High lift device
d) Anti ice device
a
2. Which of the following is correct?
a) Corrosion is major problem in terms of material lifespan
b) Corrosion cannot be considered as major factor at all

3. Let us consider the ambient air temperature is 25°C and aircraft has Mach number of 1.5. Find the stagnation temperature.
a) 432.32K
b) 789K
c) 123.56K
d) 213.458K
a
Stagnation temperature for air is given by,
Stagnation temperature = T1*(1+0.2*M2)
= (25+273.15)*(1+0.2*1.52) = 432.32K.
