1. Graphical representation of sink rate of sailplane is called ____________
a) typical speed polar
b) drag polar wing
c) lift curve of wing
d) propulsion systems
a
2. Velocity for the best glide ratio is 100ft/s. Determine velocity for minimum sink rate.
a) 76ft/s
b) 124m/s
c) 23fts
d) 45 fts2
a
3. Variometer is used for _____________
a) informing pilot when glider is in lift
b) increase lift
c) thrust reversal
d) increase thrust produced
a
4. Consider turning glide operation with bank angle of 1.5 and Weight of 125 unit. Find lift.
a) 125.042
b) 56
c) 120
d) 345
a
5. Determine the value of turn rate. Consider glider has centripetal acceleration of 10 and velocity of 9.5.
a) 1.052
b) 9.5
c) 10
d) 2.8
a
6. Determine the value of best glide ratio velocity. Consider velocity for minimum sink rate is 10 fps.
a) 13.15 fps
b) 20 fps
c) 11 fps
d) 34 fps
a
Velocity for best glide ratio = v/0.76 = 10/0.76 = 13.15 fps.
7. Consider turning gliding flight. Turn rate is given as 0.2 unit and velocity of flight is 10 unit. Find the value of turn radius.
a) 50
b) 100
c) 2
d) 8
a
8. Find the range of glider which has L/D of 13.6 and is descending from 5km.
a) 68km
b) 12 m
c) 12 inch
d) 68 m
a
9. If KCD0 is 0.014 then, find lift to drag ratio for minimum sink.
a) 3.66
b) 36.6
c) 1.4
d) 24
a
= (0.1875/0.014)0.5
= 3.66.
10. Consider a glider is descending from 2km altitude. If it covers range of 30km then, at which aerodynamic efficiency the glider was flying?
a) 15
b) 60
c) 12
d) 21
a
