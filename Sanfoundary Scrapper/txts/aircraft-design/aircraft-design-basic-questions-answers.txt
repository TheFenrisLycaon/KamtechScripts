8. Evaluate downstream Mach number if an oblique shock is observed at inlet with shock angle of 40.30°. Consider upstream Mach number is 1.65. Use following shock table.
Upstream Mach number
Shock angle 
Downstream Mach Number
1.60
49.51
1.281
1.65
40.30
1.548
1.60
38.66
1.601
1.65
37.28
1.651
1.5
64.35
0.961
a) 1.548
b) 1.601
c) 1.08
d) 1.65
a
Now, we have been asked to use the shock table. Hence, find the upstream Mach number of 1.65 in the above table. As can be seen in the table there are 2 rows which has a mach number of 1.65.
Now, observe second column of shock angle. We need to evaluate downstream Mach number at shock angle of 40.30°.
Hence, by observing the shock angle column, the downstream Mach number corresponding to our requirement (Upstream Match of 1.65 and shock angle of 40.30°) is 1.548.
9. Following diagram represents _____
a) Mixed isentropic compression inlet
b) Mixed Isotropic expansion
c) Isotropic compression
d) Isothermal expansion
a
10. Typically, diffuser length is about eight times the diameter for supersonic application.
a) True
b) False
a
11. If bypass ratio of subsonic non afterburning engine is found to be 2.1 then, what will be the specific fuel consumption of the same engine at cruise?
a) 0.8
b) 0.1
c) 0.3
d) 0.4
a
Now, SFC at cruise is given by,
SFC = 0.88*e (-0.05*BPR) = 0.88 * e (-0.05*2.1) = 0.7922 = 0.8.
12. We need to design a supersonic fighter with afterburner which has maximum Mach number of 1.8. If thrust at takeoff is 10000 unit and bypass ratio is 0.71 then, find ratio of length to the diameter for this engine.
a) 4.9
b) 1.8
c) 2
d) 3.4
a
Now, Ratio of length to diameter is given by,
L/D = 10.625*T-0.1*M0.2*e 0.04*BPR = 10.625*10000-0.1*1.80.2*e 0.04*0.71
Hence, L/D = 10.625*0.3981*1.1247*1.028 = 4.9.
13. If an aircraft has maximum Mach number of 2 and bypass ratio of 0.71 then, what will be the weight of the engine? (Find the approximate value. Given thrust at takeoff is 10000 Unit.)
a) 1058.5 unit
b) 12000 unit
c) 120
d) 234.585 unit
a
Now, Weight is given by, W = 0.063*T1.1*M0.25*e -0.81*BPR
W = 0.063*100001.1*20.25*e -0.81*0.71
W = 0.063*25118.86*1.189*0.5626 = 1058.5 unit
14. Calculate the approximate value of length at which supersonic after burning engine could be design in such a way that thrust at takeoff will be 29800 unit and maximum Mach number will be 2.12.
a) 219
b) 100
c) 301
d) 183.129
a
Now, Length L is given by, L = 3.06*T0.4*M0.2 = 3.06*298000.4*2.120.2 = 3.06*61.615*1.162 = 219 unit.
15. At which diameter we should design a supersonic after burning engine for a fighter which will have thrust at takeoff 150000 Unit and bypass ratio of 0.7.
a) 114.67 unit
b) 160.78 unit
c) 350.39 unit
d) 235.78 unit
a
Now, Diameter D is given by, D = 0.288*T0.5*e 0.04*BPR = 0.288*1500000.5*e0.04*0.7
Hence, D = 0.288*387.3*1.028 = 114.67 unit.
