1. As a designer, our task is to design wing layout such that the location of MAC from root chord or centre line is at 8ft. Find the appropriate value of the wingspan if wing is rectangular.
a) 32ft
b) 50ft
c) 28m
d) 32m
a
MAC location y = 8ft. As wing is rectangular taper ratio t =1.
Wingspan b = (6*y*(1+ t)) / (1+t+t2) = 6*8*(1+1) / (1+1+12) = 6*8*2/3 = 32ft.
2. A fighter jet is flying with wing span of 90ft. If mean aerodynamic chord MAC is at 30ft from tip chord then, to design such wing which type of planform should I use?
a) Delta
b) Rectangular
c) Square
d) Triangle
a
Location of MAC from root y = b/2 – 30ft = 90/2 – 30 = 45-30 = 15ft.
To find planform let’s find taper ratio first from y.
Location of MAC is given as, y = (b/6)*(1+t+t2) / (1+t). …. (1)
From given options, let’s consider delta wing first.
Delta wing has taper ratio near to none. Let’s consider taper ratio to be zero for idle case.
Hence, by substituting value of taper ratio in eq (1),
Y = (90/6)*1+0+0/1+0 = 90/6 = 15ft.
This value is same as we found earlier from given data. Hence, wing planform is delta.
3. An unstable A/C configuration is a typical wing-aft tail body. IF MAC is 4m then, what would be the approximated location of the CG?
a) 2m
b) 5m
c) 6m
d) 7m
a
4. Following diagram represents?
a) Rounded wingtip
b) LEX
c) Midline tip
d) Blended tip
a
5. Following diagram represents?
a) T.e. kick
b) T.e. extension
c) Rounded tip
d) Straight tip
a
6. As a designer, our job is to design a wing which has root chord Cr as 1m. What should be the approximate radius of fillet?
a) 0.1m
b) 1m
c) 2m
d) 2.1m
a
Hence, radius = 10% of Cr = 10% of 1 = 0.1*1 = 0.1m.
7. Following diagram represents?
a) Wing fillet
b) Wing chamfer
c) T-tail arrangement
d) Wing drag
a
8. Which of the following is correct?
a) We can generate flat wrap surface by using linear interpolation method
b) Flat surfaces can only be generated by using linear interpolation
c) Linear interpolation will never give flat surface
d) Linear interpolation is only used for flat wrap surfaces
a
9. Determine the corrections or otherwise of the following assertion [A] and reason [R]:
Assertion [A]: To generate new airfoil, we use spanwise line instead of chord line in flat wrap interpolation technique.
Reason[R]: Chordwise line will generate flat structure from curves having different values of tangent angle.
a) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A] 
b) Both [A] and [R] are true but [R] is not the correct reason for [A] 
c) Both [A] and [R] are false
d) [A] is true but [R] is false
d
10. At maximum thickness point, fillet is in ____________
a) purely vertical plane
b) purely in hp
c) plane at an angle of less than 20° always
d) plane at 45° always
a
11. Fillet radius is typically more at rear of the aircraft.
a) True
b) False
a
12. Wing planform is always elliptic.
a) True
b) False
b
