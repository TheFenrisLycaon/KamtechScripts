1. For high aspect ratio strength of the wing tip vortex is low.
a) True
b) False
a
2. If aspect ratio of wing is 8 and S=0.1m2 then, what will be the span of wing?
a) 0.89m
b) 0.89cm
c) 0.89
d) 0.89inch
a
Aspect ratio = span square/ reference area
8 = span square / 0.1
Span square = 8*0.1 = 0.8
Hence, span = 0.89m.
3. Which of the following is correct in accordance to diagram?
a) Aspect ratio of 1 is highest
b) Aspect ratio of 2 is maximum
c) Aspect ratio of 3 is maximum
d) Similar aspect ratio
a
4. Let’s consider an aircraft has statistically determined aspect ratio of 8.1. Aircraft has canard which gives contribution of 10% for total lift. Determine the aspect ratio of wing.
a) 9
b) 0.9
c) 10
d) 8.1
a
Canard contribution = 10%
Here, total lift is not produced by the wing only. Canard is also responsible for it as well.
Hence, wing contribution = total lift – lift by canard = 100% – 10% = 90% = 0.9.
Now, aspect ratio of the wing is given by,
ARw = ARst / wing contribution = 8.1 / 0.9 = 9.
5. An aircraft with elliptic wing planform has parasite drag coefficient as 0.6. Lift coefficient of wing is 0.25 and aspect ratio is 7.5. If induced drag co-efficient is 0.0235 then, find total drag coefficient for the wing.
a) 0.06235
b) 0.5235
c) 0.6
d) 0.0235
a
Total drag coefficient = Parasitic drag coefficient + induced drag coefficient = 0.6+0.0235 = 0.06235.

6. An aircraft with elliptic wing planform has parasite drag coefficient as 0.9. Lift coefficient of wing is 1.8 and aspect ratio is 8.5. Find total drag coefficient for the wing.
a) 1.021
b) 0.9
c) 0.121
d) 0.25
a
Lift coefficient CL = 1.8, Aspect ratio AR=8.5
Now, Total drag coefficient = Parasitic drag coefficient (CD0) + induced drag coefficient (CDi)
CDi = CL*CL / (ᴨ*e*AR) = 1.8*1.8 / (ᴨ*1*8.5) = 0.121
Hence, Total drag coefficient = CD0 + CDi = 0.9 + 0.121 = 1.021.
7. Wing sweep is used to ____
a) increase critical mach number
b) decrease critical mach number
c) increase lofting
d) increase drafting
a
8. Canard pusher aircraft uses wing sweep to change location of aerodynamic centre.
a) True
b) False
a
9. The ratio of tip and root chord is called ____
a) taper ratio
b) sweep
c) aspect ratio
d) slope
a
10. If root chord is 2m and tip chord is 0.9m then, find taper ratio.
a) 0.45
b) 0.55
c) 0.65
d) 0.25
a
Taper ratio = tip chord/root chord = 0.9/2 = 0.45.
11. What is the function of wing twist?
a) To improve stall characteristics at tip
b) To reduce lift by tail
c) To provide lofting
d) To increase engine thrust
a
12. Excessive dihedral can produce _____
a) dutch roll
b) thrust
c) pitch
d) deflection at nose
a
13. Determine the corrections or otherwise of the following assertion [A] and reason [R]:
Assertion [A]: In general, wing twist should not be more than 6°.
Reason[R]: Wing twist is used to improve stall properties at tip.
a) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A] 
b) Both [A] and [R] are true but [R] is not the correct reason for [A] 
c) [A] is true but [R] is false
d) [A] is false but [R] is true
b
