a
3. Which of the following is part of the fuel-fraction method?

4. An Aircraft has gross weight of 10000lb. At the end of the mission segment it has weight fraction as 0.985. Determine fuel consumed for this mission.
a) 150lb
b) 150kg
c) 60kg
d) 60lb
a
Aircraft gross weight W0 = 10000lb
Fuel weight fraction at the end of mission = Wx/W0 = 0.985
Here, there is no provision of reserved fuel is mentioned. So, we are neglecting reserve fuel fraction.
Now, from fuel fraction method,
Used fuel weight fraction is Wf / W0 = 1 – (Wx / W0)
= 1 – 0.985 = 0.015
Hence, fuel consumed during this mission = Wf = W0 * 0.015 = 10000 * 0.015 = 150lb.
5. Choose appropriate option for cruise mission leg weight fraction.
a) Breguet endurance formula
b) Breguet range formula
c) Cruise invert method
d) Breguet approximation
b
6. A jet aircraft is cruising at 12000ft. What will be the cruise leg (mission phase ‘n’) weight fraction?
a) Wn/Wn-1 = \(e^{\left(-\frac{R*C}{V*\frac{L}{D}}\right)}\) 
b) Wn/Wn+1 = \(e^{\left(-\frac{R*C}{V*\frac{L}{D}}\right)}\) 
c) Wn/Wn-2 = \(e^{\left(-\frac{R*C}{V*\frac{L}{D}}\right)}\) 
d) Wn/Wn-1 = \(e^{\left(-\frac{R*C}{V*\frac{L}{D}}\right)}\) 
a
R = (V/C) * (L/D) * ln (Wn-1/ Wn)
Now by re-arranging, cruise mission leg weight fraction is,
Wn/Wn-1 = \(e^{\left(-\frac{R*C}{V*\frac{L}{D}}\right)}\)
7. What will be the total fuel weight fraction for x-number of mission phases?
a) Wf / W0 = 1 – (Wx / W0)
b) Wf / W0 = 1 + (Wx / W0)
c) Wf / W0 = 1 / (Wx / W0)
d) Wf / W0 = 1 + (Wx / W0)
a
According to which if there are x – number of mission phases in mission profile then the total fuel weight fraction is given by,
Wf / W0 = 1 – (Wx / W0)
Since, reserved fuel is not mentioned we can neglect it.
8. What will be the weight fraction of the aircraft at final mission segment w.r.t. W0?
a) Multiplication of individual weight fraction
b) Division of individual weight fraction
c) Addition of individual weight fraction
d) Subtraction of individual weight fraction
a
9. How will you determine climb mission weight fraction?
a) Climb Endurance
b) Loiter
c) Always constant
d) Cruise Speed
a
10. If all the other factors remain unchanged and only aerodynamic efficiency of the aircraft is doubled then, what will be the cruise segment fuel weight fraction?
a) Will increase
b) Will decrease
c) Will remain same
d) Will be independent of aerodynamic efficiency
a
Wn/Wn-1 = \(e^{\left(-\frac{R*C}{V*\frac{L}{D}}\right)}\) 
Now if we double the value of aerodynamic efficiency the denominator will increase which in turn increases fuel fraction during cruise.
11. Fuel consumption during cruise is affected by wetted area.
a) True
b) False
a
12. A prop-driven aircraft is cruising with 90% propeller efficiency. If, range of aircraft is 7*106 ft, C=1.38*10-7 s-1 and L/D = 14 then what will be the fuel weight fraction for the cruise?
a) 0.9216
b) 0.9261
c) 0.9289
d) 0.9365
b
Range R = 7*106 ft, C = 1.38*10-7 s-1, L/D =14
Here, propeller efficiency is 90% hence, η = 0.9
Now cruise weight fraction is given by range formula. For, prop-driven aircraft it is given by,
Wcruise / W0 = \(e^{\left(-\frac{R*C}{\eta*\frac{L}{D}}\right)}\) = \(e^{-(\frac{7 * 10^ 6* 1.38 * 10^ {-7}}{0.9*14})}\) = 0.9261.
13. An Aircraft has following mission profiles with their respective mission weight fraction. There is 10% allowance of reserved fuel. Now, due to some reason loiter weight fraction has changed to 0.90. Now, with same amount of fuel as initial, will aircraft be able to perform loiter?
Mission
Weight fraction
Engine start-up
0.975
Taxi
0.98
Climb
0.970
Cruise
0.989
Loiter
0.96
Landing
0.975
a) Yes, loiter can be performed
b) No, loiter cannot be performed
c) Will not depend on change
d) 12% less fuel will require
b
First, let’s find what would be the total fuel fraction of this aircraft with 10% reserved fuel.
Total fuel fraction without reserved fuel is Wf / W0 = 1 – (Wx / W0), x = final mission phase
Now 10% of total fuel is reserved fuel hence, the actual total fuel fraction is given by,
Wf / W0 = 1 – (Wx / W0) + 10% of Wf / W0
= 1.1 * [1 – (Wx / W0)] 
Now from fuel fraction method,
Wx / W0 = multiplication of each phase fraction
= 0.975*0.98*0.970*0.989*0.96*0.975
= 0.8579
Now,
Wf / W0 = 1.1 * [1 – (Wx / W0)] 
= 1.1*[1-0.8579]
= 1.1*[0.1420]
Wf / W0 = 0.1562 – Actual total fuel weight fraction
Now, if loiter weight fraction is changed to 0.90. Now to check whether aircraft will be able to loiter or not we need to compare new total fuel fraction with actual. If it is less then aircraft will have enough fuel to loiter otherwise it won’t be able to loiter for same amount of fuel storage.
New, Wx / W0 = 0.975*0.98*0.970*0.989*0.90*0.975 = 0.8043
New, Wf / W0 = 1.1 * [1 – (Wx / W0)] = 1.1*[1-0.8043] = 0.2152 which is more. Hence, answer is no, pilot will not be able to perform loiter.
