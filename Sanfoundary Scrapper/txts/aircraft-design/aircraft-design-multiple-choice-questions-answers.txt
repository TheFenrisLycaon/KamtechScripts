1. What is the function of a typical nozzle?
a) To expand exhaust flow
b) To reduce flow velocity
c) To generate lift to fly
d) To increase pressure
a
2. Performance of engine can be controlled by nozzle.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Following diagram represents ______________
a) fixed convergent nozzle
b) fixed divergent nozzle
c) cd nozzle
d) rocket engine
a
4. Only convergent section will be used for supersonic speeds.
a) True
b) False
a
5. Consider a flow with 0.5M. Now, as area decreases, velocity of the flow inside convergent section _____________
a) increases
b) decreases
c) reduces by half always
d) velocity is independent of area
a
For subsonic speed, as area decreases the flow velocity will increase for convergent nozzle.
6. Following diagram represents ___________
a) preliminary sizing of capture area
b) lift curve
c) drag polar
d) drag coefficient curve
a
7. Our designed Mach number is 0.8. Find the required area ratio for the design. Assume isentropic relation is valid.
a) 1.038
b) 3.45
c) 5.64
d) 0.12
a
Now, area ratio is given by, A/A* = (1/M)*(1+0.2M2)3*0.5787 = (1/0.8)*(1+0.2*0.82)3*0.5787
A/A* = 0.7233*1.1283 = 1.038.
8. If area ratio is 1.110 then, at which mach number flow is flowing?
a) 0.68
b) 1.89
c) 2
d) 0.21
a
Now, as we know, A/A* = (1/M)*(1+0.2M2)3*0.5787
For given problem, we will substitute different values of Mach number from the options.
Let’s consider M = 0.68
Hence, for assumed value of Mach number,
A/A* = (1/0.68)*(1+0.2*0.682)3*0.5787
A/A* = 0.8510*1.092483 = 1.110.
The evaluated area ratio is equal to the given area ratio.
Hence, correct value of Mach number is 0.68.
9. ____________ is the most common type of boundary layer diverter used for supersonic applications.
a) Channel diverter
b) Empennage
c) Aileron
d) Elevator
a
10. Following diagram represents __________
a) cd nozzle
b) convergent nozzle
c) divergent nozzle
d) constant area nozzle
a
11. At exhaust of nozzle temperature is 200k and density of the flow is 1.01 kg/m3. If back pressure is 1 bar then, nozzle is ______________
a) nozzle can be under or over expanded
b) under expansion
c) over expanded
d) design condition
c
Now, exit pressure p = d*R*T = 200*287*1.01 = 57974 = 0.57 bar < 1 bar
Since exit pressure p < back pressure, the nozzle is over expanded.
