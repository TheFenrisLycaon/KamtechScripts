a
2. Yawing moment is positive if __________
a) right wing goes back
b) right wing comes forward
c) if nose pitches up
d) if nose pitches down
a
3. Stability about roll axis is called _____________
a) lateral stability
b) directional stability
c) longitudinal stability
d) elevator control
a
4. If aircraft is in straight flight (cruise with lift of 100N) then, what will be the value of net rolling moment? Consider ideal conditions.
a) 0 unit
b) 12 Nm
c) 23 unit
d) 25 N/m
a
At cruise condition, net rolling moment is zero. As at cruise all the forces and moments are in equilibrium or in balanced.

8. An aircraft experiences sideslip of 4° and side wash at vertical tail is 1.2°. What will be the AOA at vertical tail?
a) 5.2°
b) 6.89°
c) 1.2°
d) 21.3°
a
9. Aircraft can suffer from adverse yaw during rolling.
a) True
b) False
a
10. An aircraft is flying in the north direction at a velocity of 60.5m/s under cross wind from the east to west of 5m/s. If the value of Cnβ=0.02/deg, where. Find sideslip angle β.
a) -4.72°
b) -5°
c) 4.7°
d) 3.18°
a
For given cross wind condition sideslip angle β is given by,
β = -arctan (e/n) = -arctan (5/60.5) = -4.72°.
11. Determine the value of rudder deflection δr for an aircraft which is flying in north with the velocity of 60.5 m/s under the crosswind of 5m/s from east to west with Cnβ=0.02/deg and Cnδr = -0.045/deg, where sideslip angle β is -4.72°.
a) -2.09°
b) 3.5°
c) -4.5°
d) -4.74°
a
Now, rudder deflection δr = – [Cnβ/ Cnδr]*β = -[0.02/-0.045]*(-4.72) = -2.09°.
12. Find sideslip angle if [u, v, w] = [100, 5, 2.5]. Consider steady level flight.
a) 2.86°
b) 4.5°
c) 4.7°
d) 2.1°
a
Sideslip angle = arcsine (v/V) = arcsine (5/100.156) = 2.86°.
13. Find resultant velocity if [u, v, w] = [80, 2, 4.5]. Consider steady level flight.
a) 80.151
b) 90
c) 10.52
d) 100.159
a
14. Determine sideslip angle for a steady level unaccelerated flight with [u, v, w] = [80, 2, 4.5].
a) 1.43
b) 5.4
c) 5
d) 12.32
a
Sideslip angle = arcsine (v/V) = arcsine (2/80.1521) = 1.43°.
15. Determine the net velocity if sideslip angle is 3.8 degree and [v] = 4.2 unit.
a) 63.23 unit
b) 100 unit
c) 100.23 unit
d) 102.623 unit
