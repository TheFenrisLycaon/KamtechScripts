a
4. From following diagram body-1 is not streamline?
a) True
b) False
a
5. NACA stands for _____
a) National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
b) National Authorized Committee for Aeronautics
c) National Advisory Committee for Aero models
d) National Advisory Committee for Arithmetic
a
6. The straight line joining L.E. and T.E. of an airfoil is _______

b) camber
c) camber line
d) radii
a
7. Determine the corrections or otherwise of the following assertion [A] and reason [R]:
Assertion [A]: Most of the airfoils are built with blunt trailing edge having very small finite thickness.
Reason[R]: Perfect sharp trailing edge is difficult to build.
a) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A] 
b) Both [A] and [R] are true but [R] is not the correct reason for [A] 
c) [A] is true but [R] is false
d) [A] is false but [R] is true
a
8. Camber represents the curvature of an airfoil.
a) True
b) False
a
9. An airfoil with symmetric profile has pitching moment about aerodynamic centre as 13 Nm at 4° AOA. Determine Pitching moment at same point if AOA is increased by 8°.
a) 13Nm
b) 8Nm
c) 5Nm
d) 13Ncm
a
Pitching moment PM1 = 13Nm at AOA = 4°.
Now AOA is increased by 8°. Hence new AOA = 4+8 = 12°.
Now PM1 is acting through aerodynamic centre. PM will be independent of AOA at aerodynamic centre. Hence, at 12° pitching moment will not change.
Hence, at same point at 12° PM2 = PM1 = 13Nm.
10. A thin airfoil is defined as NACA 0009 is at ɑ = 5°. What is the value of lift curve slope?
a) 2ᴨ per rad
b) 2ᴨ per degree
c) 4 per degree
d) 0.4 per degree
a
AOA ɑ = 5°
As mentioned the airfoil is thin. Hence, thin airfoil theory can be used.
According to thin airfoil theory, for thin airfoil,
Lift curve slope = 2π 1/rad = 0.11 1/degree.
11. For a cambered airfoil section lift is 30N. Airfoil is operating in such way that dynamic lift is 20N. Determine the lift co-efficient for the airfoil.
a) 1.5
b) 1.5N
c) 0.5
d) 0.5N
a
Lift co-efficient = section lift/dynamic lift = 30/20 = 1.5.
12. Determine the value for maximum camber for NACA1235 airfoil. Given chord is 1m.
a) 0.01m
b) 0.02m
c) 0.021
d) 0.012
a
Chord c=1m.
Based on NACA 4 digit, first digit is the maximum camber in hundreds of chord.
Hence, maximum camber for NACA 1235 = 0.01*chord = 0.01*1 = 0.01m.
