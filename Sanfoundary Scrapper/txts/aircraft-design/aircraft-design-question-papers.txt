b) total kinetic energy only
c) total potential energy only
d) product of kinetic and potential energy
a
2. Total energy divided by the aircraft weight is term as ____________
a) Specific energy
b) KE
c) PE

a
3. If Total energy of an aircraft is found to be 1200 unit and kinetic energy is 1100 unit then, determine the potential energy.
a) 100 unit
b) 213 unit
c) 456 unit
d) 500 unit
a
4. Find the total energy of an aircraft if kinetic energy and potential energy are 3600 and 1200 units respectively.
a) 4800 unit
b) 2800 unit
c) 1234 unit
d) 5789 unit
a
= 3600 + 1200 = 4800 unit.
5. If sum of potential and kinetic energy of an aircraft is 5000 unit and aircraft weighs around 1200 unit then, determine specific total energy.
a) 4.16 unit
b) 2.89 unit

6. Unit of specific energy is __________
a) meter
b) meter per second
c) unit less
d) newton
a
7. If my aircraft has access power off 520 KW and it weighs around 1200 N then, determine the value of specific excess power.
a) 433.33 m/s
b) 123.88 ft. s
c) 119
d) 345.768m/s
a
= 520*1000/1200 = 433.33 m/s.
8. Following diagram represents _________
a) specific power vs mach number
b) mach number for various propulsion systems
c) drag polar
d) lift curve slope
a
9. Following diagram represents __________
a) zero specific power Contour
b) zero lift
c) zero drag
d) drag at zero lift
a
10. Following diagram represents _________
a) turn rate and specific power relations

a
11. Find the approximate value of time required to change energy height. Consider change in energy height is 250m and specific power for the operation is 100m/s.
a) 2.5s
b) 4.5min
c) 2.5hr
d) 2.59min
a
Time required = change in energy height/specific power = 250/100 = 2.5 s.
12. If a Maneuver requires specific power of 1200 unit then, find the approximate value of fuel specific energy. Given thrust as 1000 unit and tsfc of 0.00042 unit.
a) 2857.14 unit
b) 1568.45 unit
c) 4500 unit
d) 6789 unit
a
= 1200/1000*0.00042 = 2857.14 unit.
