1. How do you define the lift coefficient?
a) Ratio of aerodynamic lift to the dynamic lift
b) Lift to drag
c) Wing lift to weight of aircraft
d) Thrust to weight
a
2. Which of the following is correct?
a) D = q*S*CD
b) D = q*S*CD*ρ
c) D = q*CD
d) D = q
a
3. If an aircraft as pitching moment of 10 Nm and dynamic pitching moment is about 8.25Nm. Find the moment coefficient Cm.
a) 1.21
b) 3
c) 5.62
d) 0.0921
a
Cm = 10/8.25 = 1.21.
4. If an aircraft is operating with dynamic pressure of the free stream q=20Pa and has area of wing is 10m2 then evaluate drag experience by the aircraft. Given drag coefficient is 0.9.
a) 180 N
b) 345 N
c) 234 N
d) 567 N
a
Drag D = q*S*CD = 20*10*0.9 = 180N.
5. If Lift produced by wing is 350N then, determine lift coefficient. Given q = 35Pa and S=8.5 m2.
a) 1.174
b) 2.8
c) 5.6
d) 4.37
a
= 350/35*8.5 = 1.174.
6. Following diagram represents _____________
a) typical drag polar
b) drag polar for non-symmetric wing
c) wing lift curve
d) thrust required for wing
a
7. For a symmetrical airfoil drag coefficient at zero lift is 0.05 and induced drag coefficient is 0.0025. Find the total drag coefficient.
a) 0.0525
b) 0.45
c) 5.25
d) 52.5
a
= 0.05+0.0025 = 0.0525.
8. Cambered wing has minimum drag coefficient of 0.05 and constant K of 0.023. If CL is 0.8 then find the value of CD. Given minimum drag occurs at CL of 0.1.
a) 0.06127
b) 6.1
c) 61.2
d) 0.6721
a
Now, CD is given by,
CD = CDmin + K*(CL – CLmindrag)2
= 0.05+0.023*(0.8-0.1)2
= 0.06127.
9. Following diagram represents ______________
a) cambered wing drag polar
b) cambered airfoil drag polar
c) symmetric wing drag polar
d) drag polar of an airfoil
a
10. A wing is designed to operate with free stream velocity of 20m/s and air density of 1.225 kg/m3. Find aerodynamic efficiency of given wing. Consider S as 8 m2, CL as 0.9 and CD as 1.25.
a) 0.72
b) 2
c) 3
d) 5.23
a
Aerodynamic efficiency is defined as the ratio of CL and CD of the aircraft.
Hence, Aerodynamic efficiency = CL/CD = 0.9/1.25 = 0.72.
