b) drag polar
c) thrust loading
d) power loading
a
3. At same value of maximum lift AOA, lift coefficient of Cambered wing is _________
a) higher than uncambered wing
b) lower than uncambered wing
c) same as cambered airfoil always
d) not dependent on camber
a
4. Following diagram represents _______
a) lift curve slope vs mach number

5. A 2D airfoil is operating at 0.6M. Find the approximate value of lift curve slope in per rad.
a) 7.85
b) 1.9
c) 2.3
d) 3.87
a
2D lift curve slope = 2*π / (1-M2)0.5
= 2*π / (1-0.62)0.5 = 7.85 per rad.

6. A supersonic 2D airfoil has Mach number of 1.5. Find Lift curve slope of the airfoil.
a) 0.062 per degree
b) 0.062 per rad
c) 24 per degree
d) 12.56 per degree
a
2D lift curve slope = 4 / (M2 – 1)0.5
= 4 / (1.52 – 1)0.5 = 3.57 per rad = 3.57/57.3 = 0.062 per degree.
7. If an airfoil is designed to provide lift curve slope as 7.8, then find airfoil efficiency. The actual lift curve slope of the airfoil is 7.4.
a) 94.87%
b) 45%
c) 15.6%
d) 98.7%
a
= 7.4/7.8 = 0.9487 = 94.87%.
8. A subsonic aircraft wing has aspect ratio of 8. Now we have been asked to provide winglet to this wing. Evaluate approximate value of effective aspect ratio of winglet is considered.
a) 9.6
b) 23
c) 32
d) 4.89
a
= 1.2*8 = 9.6.
9. A subsonic aircraft has unswept wing which has maximum lift coefficient of 1.4. Now, consider wing is provided sweep of 25° at quarter chord point. Now, determine the change in maximum lift coefficient due to the provision of sweep.
a) Maximum Lift coefficient will be reduced by 0.2580 amount
b) Increment by 1.245
c) Decreases by 0.0476 amount
d) Maximum lift coefficient will increase by 56%
a
Now, sweep of 25° is provided at quarter chord point. Hence sweep angle at quarter chord s = 25°
Maximum lift coefficient CL2 = CL1*0.9*cos (a)
= 1.4*0.9*cos (25°) = 1.1419.
Now, change in maximum lift coefficient = CL2 – CL1 = 1.1419 – 1.4 = -0.2580.
Hence, by implementing the sweep of 25° maximum lift coefficient is reduced by 0.2508 unit.
10. Following diagram represents __________
a) plain flap
b) aileron
c) rudder
d) spoiler
