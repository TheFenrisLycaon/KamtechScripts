d) thrust required graph
a
3. An aircraft is cruising with lift of 150N. Find the weight of aircraft.
a) 0.150KN
b) 150KN
c) 123N
d) 15KN
a
4. The dive speed in v-n diagram represents _________
a) maximum dynamic pressure
b) maximum manifold pressure of supercharger
c) hydraulic actuator speed limit
d) rate of climb
a
5. A typical aircraft has level cruise speed of 0.6M. Find the dive speed for given subsonic aircraft.
a) 0.9M
b) 1.9M
c) 330m/s
d) 345m/s
a
= 0.6 + 0.5*0.6 = 0.9M.
6. If actual speed of aircraft is 100 m/s and is flying at certain altitude with density ratio of 0.3 then, find equivalent at speed at that altitude.
a) 54.77m/s
b) 125ft/s2
c) 1.2M
d) 1.5M
a
= 100*(0.30.5) = 54.77 m/s.
7. My aircraft is flying at particular altitude. At that altitude ratio of actual airspeed to the equivalent airspeed is 1.4 then, what should be the desire value of density ratio?
a) 0.51
b) 1.89
c) 0.12
d) 0.189
a
= (1/1.4)2 = 0.51.

a) ∼2.3°
b) ∼6°
c) ∼5.6°
d) 9°
a
= arctan (10/250)
= arctan 0.04 = 2.29 ∼ 2.3 deg.
