1. The parameter marked by ’?’ in the diagram is _____
a) trailing edge
b) leading edge
c) chord
d) camber
a
2. The cross-sectional shape of wing is called _____
a) airfoil
b) circle
c) camber
d) chord
a
3. Aerofoil affects the performance parameters of aircraft.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Which of the following is correct?
a) Lift produced by an airfoil is always equal to weight
b) Drag by sphere is more than the drag produced by an airfoil for similar conditions
c) Drag by sphere is less than that of produced by an airfoil for similar conditions
d) Drag by sphere is equal to the drag produced by an airfoil for similar conditions
b
5. An aerofoil is operating with flow velocity of 100m/s. Aerofoil is symmetric and is at 0° AOA. Determine lift produced by this aerofoil.
a) 10.5 N
b) 0 N
c) 50 N
d) 100N
b
Given, velocity V=100m/s, AOA = 0°.
For symmetric airfoil at 0° AOA pressure will be same as upper and lower surface.
Hence, lift = 0N.
6. Which of the following is not type of an airfoil?
a) Symmetric
b) Camber
c) Whitcomb
d) Vortex
d
7. Airfoil is a streamline shape.
a) True
b) False
a
8. A symmetric airfoil is operating with flow velocity of 350m/s. The lift produced by the airfoil is 21 N at 0.008 rad AOA. If chord is c m then, what will be the pressure difference across the airfoil?
a) 21/c Pa
b) 21c/2 N
c) 21 Pa
d) 21c N
a
Flow velocity V=350m/s, Lift L=21N, AOA = 0.008rad
Chord = c m, Span of airfoil = 1 unit
Pressure difference = Lift/Area of airfoil
= 21/c*1 = 21/c Pa.
9. If an airfoil has lift of 200 N at 10° AOA, then what is induced drag produced by airfoil at that AOA?
a) 0 N
b) 100
c) 0
d) 100 N
a
Here, airfoil is mentioned which is 2D shape.
For an airfoil Induced drag Di = 0N.
10. Find location of aerodynamic centre from leading edge if, chord is 10m and airfoil has flow velocity of 0.2 M.
a) 2.5 m
b) 0.2 m
c) 5 m
d) 10 m
a
Chord = 10m
Given velocity is less than the sonic speed.
Hence, location of aerodynamic center is = 25% of chord = 0.25*10 = 2.5m from leading edge.
11. Consider a NACA 2812 airfoil. It is operating with flow velocity of 900m/s with chord of 1m. What should be the maximum thickness of this airfoil?
a) 0.12m
b) 0.21m
c) 0.9m
d) 28.12m
a
Here, velocity = 900 m/s, chord = 1m
From NACA-4 digit,
Maximum thickness = last two digits in percent of chord=12% of chord = 0.12*1 = 0.12m.
12. An airfoil is subjected to the flow with temperature of 288.16K and flow is ideal. The velocity at the leading edge is ____
a) 0m/s
b) 250m/s
c) 288.16m/s
d) 16.882m/s
a
For idle flow, at leading edge flow is brought to rest isentropically.
Hence, velocity at leading edge = velocity of flow at the impact to leading edge = 0m/s.
13. Pitching moment co-efficient for an airfoil is given by _____
a) lift*area
b) drag*area
c) section pitching moment/dynamic pitching moment
d) lift/dynamic moment
c
14. Which of these is not part of an airfoil?
a) Leading edge
b) Chord
c) Camber
d) Fins
a
15. We are using the airfoil in the aircraft as _____
a) it is a streamline shape which provides better aerodynamics
b) it is a random shape can be changed to rectangular as well
c) it is easy to make than rectangular
d) it is not a streamline body
a
