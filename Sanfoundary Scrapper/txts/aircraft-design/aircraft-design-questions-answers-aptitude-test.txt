1. Total exposed area that would get wet if immersed in fluid is called ____________
a) wetted area
b) volume
c) length
d) planform of wing
a
2. Wetted area has effect on drag estimation.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Wing has planform area of 2m2. If wing is paper thin then, find wetted area of the wing.
a) 4m2
b) 10m2
c) 5m2
d) 20m2
a
Since, wing is paper thin wetted are = 2*planform area = 2*2 = 4m2.
4. Find the wetted area of given body.
a) 65m2
b) 75
c) 85m2
d) 200
a
Wetted area Aw = area under the curve = area of triangle + area of rectangle
Aw = (0.5*6*5) + (10*5) = 15+50 = 65m2.
5. If thickness ratio t/c is less or equal to the 0.05 then, the wetted area is ____
a) Swet = 2.003*Sexposed
b) Swet = 2.003*4*Sexposed
c) Swet = 2/Sexposed
d) Swet = 2*Sexposed
a

6. A wing has thickness of 15% of chord then, find the approximated wetted area. Given exposed area A is 10m2.
a) 20.55m2
b) 26.55
c) 36
d) 56
a
For given thickness, wetted area Aw is given by,
Aw = A*(1.977+0.52*(t/c)) = 10*(1.977+0.52*0.15) = 20.55m2
7. For wetted area Aw, which of the following is correct?
a) Aw = 3.4*(Stop + Aside) / 2
b) Aw = 3.4*(Stop + Aside) / 5
c) Aw = 3.4*(Stop + Aside) / 4
d) Aw = 3.4*(Stop + Aside) / 3
a
8. A fuselage is designed with circular C/S only. Average projected area is 28.2m2 then, find the wetted area of this fuselage.
a) 88.6m2
b) 96 m
c) 540cm
d) 253m
a
Now, wetted area Aw = π*A = π*28.2 = 88.59 = 88.6m2.
9. Wetted area of a rectangular body is 64.64m2. Find the average projected area.
a) 16.16m2
b) 15.85 m2
c) 25.368 km
d) 45.45 cm
a
Now, average projected area A = Aw/4 = 64.64/4 = 16.16m2.
10. Fuselage has wetted area of 20m2. Given Aright = 5m2. Find the value of area viewed from top.
a) 6.8m2
b) 9.8m2
c) 6.8m
d) 68m
a
Now, area vied from top A is given by,
A = 0.588*Aw – Aright = 0.588*20 – 5 = 11.764-5 = 6.764 = 6.8m2.
11. Find the approximated volume for body as shown in below.
a) 77m3
b) 77m
c) 7.7m
d) 77 cm
a
= area of triangle + rectangle area + 8 + 4 + 6 = 0.5*6*3 + 5*10 + 8 + 4 + 6 = 9+50+8+4+6 = 77m3.
12. A fuselage is configure to have length L. What will be the approximated internal volume (V)?
a) V = 3.4*(Stop*Aside/4L)
b) V = 3.4/4L
c) V = 3.4*(Stop*Aside/4)
d) V = 0.4*(Stop*Aside/L)
a
13. If a fuselage has length of 12m and area when viewed from top and side are 4m2 and 8m2 respectively. Find the approximate value of volume.
a) 2.26m3
b) 2.65m2
c) 2.285
d) 2.65
a
Now, internal volume V is given by,
V = 3.4*(Stop*Aside/4L) = 3.4*(4*8/4*12) = 3.4*32/48 = 2.26m3.
14. My fuselage has length of 10.12m and volume of 8m3. Now if I want to design same fuselage but with volume of 16m3 then, what should be the length of fuselage? Given, all others parameters are held constant.
a) 5.06m
b) 1012cm
c) 1000mm
d) 6.025m
a
Now, we are asked to design same fuselage which has volume of 16m3.
Hence, new volume V2 = 16m3.
Internal volume V is inversely proportional to length L of the fuselage.
Here, we have been asked held all other parameters constant.
Hence, L2 = (V1/V2)*L1 = (8/16)*10.12 =5.06m3.
15. If for a given fuselage Stop=10m2, Aside=14m2, L = 10m then, find the ratio of wetted area to the volume of fuselage.
a) 3.42 per m
b) 6.68 per m3
c) 8.36 m
d) 4.001
a
Now ratio of wetted area Aw and volume V is given by,
Aw/V = 2*L*(Stop + Aside) / (Stop*Aside)
Aw/V = 2*10*(10+14) / (10*14) = 20*24/140 = 3.42 per m.
