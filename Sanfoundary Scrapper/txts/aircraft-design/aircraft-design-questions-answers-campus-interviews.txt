4. An aircraft has L/D as 12 and thrust required at this value is 100N. Now if L/D has doubled then what will be the new thrust required?
a) 50N
b) 500N
c) 100 N

b) 211115W
c) 2354W
d) 500W
a

a) 2400N
b) 1.25
c) 9.85
d) 4500 KN

a) 1.2
b) 2.1
c) 1.7
d) 7.5
a

10. Find instantaneous range of a jet propelled aircraft if lift to drag ratio is 12 and weight fraction at cruise W1/W0 is 1.9. Consider cruise speed of 120m/s and SFC of 0.00161 per second.
a) 574km
b) 574m
c) 574miles
d) 574ft
a
= 12*(120/0.00161)*ln (1.9) = 574Km.
11. An aircraft has maximum lift to drag ratio of 15. If we want to fly aircraft for best range then, find the best value of aerodynamic efficiency to achieve above mentioned result.
a) 12.9
b) 13.5
c) 15
d) 12.1
a
= 0.866*15 = 12.9.
12. A propeller aircraft has wing loading of 30 unit and is operating with density of 1.21 unit. Determine velocity for maximum loiter. Consider K/CD0 as 0.1.
a) 3unit
b) 5unit
c) 9unit
d) 10unit
a
= \(\sqrt{\frac{2*30*\sqrt{0.1/3}}{1.21}} = \sqrt{49.58*0.1816}\) = 3 unit.
13. A prop driven aircraft has propeller efficiency of 0.92 and C as 0.000745 1/m. If lift to drag ratio is 14 and weight fraction as 1.145 then, find range of the propeller driven aircraft.
a) 2340.95m
b) 2340.5miles
c) 2340km
d) 2500miles
a
= 14*[0.92/0.000745]*ln (1.145) = 2340.95m.
14. A jet engine is designed to operate at endurance of 12hrs. If weight fraction is 1.6 and jet engine has tsfc C as 0.00021 per second then, find at which lift to drag ratio that can satisfy above criteria.
a) 19.3
b) 18
c) 12
d) 12.6
a
= 12*3600*0.00021 / ln 1.6
= 9.072/0.47 = 19.3.
