1. What is the typical range for empty weight fraction?
a) 0.3-0.7
b) 0.1-0.125
c) 0.14-0.28
d) 0.25-0.27
a
2. Which of the following is the correct pair?
a) Empty weight fraction is similar to gross weight of the aircraft
b) Empty weight fraction is inversely proportion to gross weight of the aircraft
c) Empty weight fraction is directly proportion to gross weight of the aircraft
d) Empty weight fraction is not related with the gross weight of the aircraft
b
3. Which of the following pair is correct based on the empty weight fraction?
a) Flying boat-0.77, Jet trainer-0.65
b) Flying boat-0.65, Jet trainer-0.77
c) Flying boat-0.45, Jet trainer-0.65
d) Flying boat-0.3, Jet trainer-1.0
a
4. For a typical jet following diagram is presented. What should be the average empty weight fraction for the aircraft?
a) 0.5
b) 0.35
c) 0.425
d) 0.42
c
From chart, the average value of weight fraction = (0.5+0.45+0.4+035)/4
= 0.425
5. The design take-off gross weight of aircraft is given by _____
a) W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload + Wfuel – Wempty
b) W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload – Wfuel – Wempty
c) W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload + Wfuel * Wempty
d) W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload + Wfuel + Wempty
d
6. The empty weight fraction of a jet transport with fixed sweep is given by ______
a) 1.02*(Wo-0.06)*1.0
b) 1.5*(Wo-0.16)*1.0
c) 1.09*(Wo-0.06)*1.12
d) 1.02*(Wo-0.06)*1.04
a
The fuel and empty weight are taken as fractions of gross weight and thus following is given as
Empty weight fraction= Wempty / W0 = A*K*(W0) c
Where, A and c are constant and dependent of type of Aircraft and K = variable sweep constant
For a typical Jet transport aircraft with fixed sweep, A = 1.02, c = -0.06 and K = 1.0.
7. A military Aircraft should be designed to have ______
a) lowest possible empty weight fraction
b) highest possible empty weight fraction
c) empty weight fraction higher than 0.89
d) empty weight fraction unity
a
8. Determine the corrections or otherwise of the following assertion [A] and reason [R]:
Assertion [A]: Flying boats have higher values of empty weight fraction than that of the military aircraft.
Reason[R]: Military aircraft has to be lighter in weight.
a) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A] 
b) Both [A] and [R] are true but [R] is not the correct reason for [A] 
c) [A] is true but [R] is false
d) [A] is false but [R] is true
d
9. Which of the following is true?
a) Lowest possible empty weight fraction in practice is zero
b) F-35 aircraft has the highest possible empty weight fraction
c) Empty weight fraction will be different for different type of aircrafts
d) Empty weight fraction is always same for each aircraft
c
10. Variable sweep wings have higher empty weight fraction than that of the fixed sweep wing.
a) True
b) False
a
