10. An airliner with take-off gross weight of 2100kg is cruising with fuel weight fraction of 0.280. Then, what will be the weight of fuel (Wf)?
a) 588kg
b) 588lb
c) 90kg
d) 28lb
a
Aircraft take-off gross weight W0 = 2100kg,
Fuel weight fraction = Wf/W0 = 0.28
Hence, fuel weight Wf = (Wf/W0) * W0 = 0.28*2100 = 588kg.
11. A prop-driven aircraft having fuel weight of 650kg. Now, aircraft is taxing on runway, after which it has fuel fraction of 0.975. Determine fuel used during taxing of aircraft, if W0 = 5000kg.
a) 225kg
b) 125kg
c) 221kg
d) 125.65lb
b
Aircraft take-off gross weight W0 = 5000kg,
Fuel weight fraction after taxi = Wtaxi/W0 = 0.975
Here, there is no provision of reserved fuel is mentioned. So, we are neglecting reserve fuel fraction.
Now, from fuel fraction method,
Used fuel weight fraction is Wf /W0 = 1 – (Wtaxi/W0)
= 1 – 0.975 = 0.025
Hence, fuel used during taxing mission = Wf = W0 * 0.025 = 125kg.
12. A jet transport aircraft has fuel storage of 1200kg. It has completed taxi phase and preparing for take-off. At the end of the taxing, it has fuel fraction of 0.98. Determine how much fuel is available after taxing. Given take-off gross weight is 9000kg.
a) 1020kg
b) 180kg
c) 1800kg
d) 2240lb
a
Aircraft take-off gross weight W0 = 9000kg, Fuel storage = 1200kg
Fuel weight fraction after taxi = Wtaxi/W0 = 0.98
Here, there is no provision of reserved fuel is mentioned so, we are neglecting reserve fuel fraction.
Now, from fuel fraction method,
Used fuel weight fraction is Wf / W0 = 1 – (Wtaxi/W0)
= 1 – 0.98 = 0.02
Hence, fuel used during taxing mission = Wf = W0 * 0.02 = 180kg.
Now, remaining fuel weight = fuel storage – fuel used during taxi
= 1200 – 180 = 1020kg.
13. Determine the corrections or otherwise of the following assertion [A] and reason [R]:
Assertion [A]: Fuel consumption is more for low level, high speed flight mission.
Reason[R]: At low altitude, the aerodynamic efficiency decreases drastically which affects the engine efficiency and range as well. To maintain cruise flight more fuel consumption is required.
a) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A] 
b) Both [A] and [R] are true but [R] is not the correct reason for [A] 
c) [A] is true but [R] is false
d) [A] is false but [R] is true

14. Mission leg fuel fraction is defined by _____
a) weight at end of the phase to that of at the begin
b) weight at end of the phase to that of at the begin
c) weight of phase at the begin
d) weight at end of the phase
