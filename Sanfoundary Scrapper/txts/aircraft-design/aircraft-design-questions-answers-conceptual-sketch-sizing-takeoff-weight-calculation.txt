a
4. An aircraft with crew and payload of 180kg is flying. If fuel weight fraction is 0.353 and empty weight fraction 0.481 then, what will be the gross weight of aircraft?
a) 2391kg
b) 2391lb
c) 1000kg
d) 1000lb
b
Fuel weight fraction Wf / W0 = 0.353, empty weight fraction We / W0 = 0.481
Gross weight of aircraft is,
W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload + Wfuel + Wempty
By re-arranging,
W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload / [1 – (Wf / W0) – (We / W0)] 
= 180 / [1-0.353-0.481] = 1084.33 kg = 2390.96lb 
5. Initial guess of gross weight will be same for every aircraft.
a) True
b) False
b
6. Following diagram is showing mission profile with different phases with mission segment fuel fraction as shown. If crew weight is 150kg, payload of 600kg and empty fraction of 0.495. Determine gross weight of the aircraft.
a) 4430kg
b) 39810kg
c) 4431lb
d) 38910lb
a
Fuel weight fraction Wf / W0 = 1.06[1 – Wx/W0],
Now from fuel fraction method,
Wx / W0 = multiplication of each phase fraction
= 0.975*0.98*0.96*0.8*0.96*0.97
= 0.6833
Now,
Wf / W0 = 1.06 * [1 – (Wx / W0)] = 0.3357
Empty weight fraction We / W0 = 0.481
Gross weight of aircraft is,
W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload + Wfuel + Wempty
By re-arranging,
W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload / [1 – (Wf/ W0) – (We / W0)] 
= 150 + 600 / [1-0.3357-0.495] = 4430kg
7. An aircraft has cruise range of 1500NM and SFC C = 0.5 1/hr. Cruise velocity of jet aircraft is 570ft/s with L/D as 13.2. Aircraft is supposed to do loiter of 2 hrs then what should be the gross weight of aircraft? Given, empty weight fraction of 0.55, crew and payload OF 6500kg with 0.98 as mission segment fuel fraction for climb, take-off and landing.
a) 37000 kg
b) 37.8 ton
c) 37880lb
d) 3780 kg
b
Since, mission profiles are given we need to find mission segment fuel weight fraction for each.
For take-off, climb and landing it is given as 0.98.
For cruise,
Range R 1500 nm= 9114000ft, C =0.5 1/hr. =0.0001389 1/s, L/D =13.2, velocity V=570 ft/s
Now cruise weight fraction is given by Range formula. For, prop-driven aircraft it is given by,
Wcruise / W0 = \(e^{\left(-\frac{R*C}{V*\frac{L}{D}}\right)}\) = \(e^{(-\frac{9114000*0.0001389}{570*13.2})}\) = 0.8451
Loiter: loiter of 2 hour is given hence,
Endurance E = 2*3600 = 7200 s
Now, loiter fuel fraction
Wloiter / W0 = \(e^{\left(-\frac{E*C}{\frac{L}{D}}\right)}\) = \(e^{(-\frac{7200*0.0001389}{13.2})}\) = 0.9270
Now from fuel fraction method,
Wx / W0 = multiplication of each phase fraction
= 0.98*0.98*0.8451*0.9270*0.98
= 0.7373
Now,
Wf / W0 = 1.06 * [1 – (Wx / W0)] = 1.06 * [1-0.7373] = 0.2784
Empty weight fraction We / W0 = 0.55
Gross weight of aircraft is,
W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload + Wfuel + Wempty
By re-arranging,
W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload / [1 – (Wf / W0) – (We / W0)] 
= 6500 / [1-0.2784-0.55] = 37880 kg = 37.8 ton
8. Total take-off gross weight depends on _____
a) fuel consumption only
b) only on aerodynamic efficiency
c) fuel, crew, payload and empty weight
d) independent
c
9. Which of the following is correct?
a) Fuel weight fraction is based on mission profile only
b) Take-off gross weight is sum of all possible weight of aircraft
c) Empty weight fraction is always 0.55
d) Crew load is always half of payload
b
10. An aircraft has Crew and payload of 180kg. It has empty weight fraction of 0.48 and fuel weight is 0.7 times empty weight. What will be the gross weight of aircraft?
a) 2157lb
b) 215kg
c) 950kg
d) 1000lb
a
Empty weight fraction We / W0 = 0.48
Fuel weight is 0.7 times empty weight.
Hence, Wf = 0.7*We
Hence, Wf / W0 = 0.7*We / W0 = 0.7*0.48 = 0.336
Gross weight of aircraft is,
W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload + Wfuel + Wempty
By re-arranging,
W0 = Wcrew + Wpayload / [1 – (Wf/ W0) – (We / W0)] 
= 180 / [1-0.336-0.48] = 978.26kg = 2157.06lb.
11. Keeping all other factors constant if only range of aircraft is increased then, what will be effect on the gross weight of aircraft?
a) Gross weight will increase
b) Will decrease
c)  Unchanged
d) Not depended on range
