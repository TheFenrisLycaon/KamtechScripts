6. Typically, a fuselage is lofted by using 5-10 control station based on requirements of fuselage.
a) True
b) False
a
7. If distance between shoulder point and tangent point is much higher then, it will produce ____________
a) flat C/S shape
b) circle shape only
c) circle with diameter as distance
d) circle of radius as distance between points
a
8. Following diagram will generate _____________
a) square C/S shape
b) circular profile
c) elliptic profile
d) flat surface
a
9. As a designer our task is to generate fuselage through conic lofting method. If an intermediate C/S shape is elliptic then, what should be the appropriate value of conic shape parameter?
a) 0.4142-0.5
b) 0.7
c) 0.8369
d) 1.2-1.5
a
Conic shape parameter CSP = DS / DC, where D = midpoint of line drawn from end point A to end point B, C = tangent point, S = shoulder point.
When CSP = 0.4142 and AC = BC then it will generate circular shape.
Now, when CSP = 0.5 it will produce parabola. Hence, to generate elliptic cross section value of CSP should be between 0.4142 and 0.5 based on our requirement.
10. Find the distance DS in the following diagram. Given contour is parabolic.
a) 3.12
b) 4.12
c) 6.2
d) 0.5
a
A parabolic shape has conic shape parameter of 0.5.
From figure,
Conic shape parameter CSP = |DS|/|DC|
From Pythagorean Theorem, |DC| = 6.24.
Hence, |DS| = CSP*|DC| = 0.5*6.24 = 3.12.
11. Which of the following is correct?
a) Flat wrap technique is cost effective
b) Flat wrap is very costly
c) Flat wrap is not lofting method
