1. Noise produced by an aircraft is called __________
a) aural signature
b) aurora beam
c) signal beam
d) ir beam
a
2. Primary cause of aircraft noise is ___________
a) engine exhaust
b) lift
c) fuselage
d) cabin
a
3. Small diameter and high velocity jet will produce _____________
a) more noise
b) less noise
c) less aural signature
d) independent of diameter and velocity
a
4. Arrange in the correct order of noise produced by engine type.
a) Turbojet > turbofan > reciprocating engine
b) Turbojet < turbofan < reciprocating engine
c) Turbojet > turbofan = reciprocating engine
d) Turbojet > turbofan < reciprocating engine
a
5. To reduce piston exhaust noise ______________
a) we can use more mufflers
b) mufflers can be used only
c) reduce lift always
d) increase jet speed always
a
6. Propeller aircraft experiences internal noise.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Which of the following is correct?
a) Some clearance should be provided between propeller and fuselage
b) Lift will be reduced if only drag is reduced
c) Thrust will be lower than the drag always
d) Engine exhaust does not make any noise
a
8. To reduce aural signatures of engine exhaust, we can use _____________
a) insulating material
b) lofting
c) drafting
d) non-insulating material
a
9. Let’s consider a propeller aircraft propeller diameter of 24 feet then, what would be the minimum value of clearance that is required for safe operation of propeller typically?
a) 6ft
b) 8ft
c) 10ft
d) 20ft
a
Typical minimum clearance = d/4 = 24/4 = 6ft.

a) By using chevron nozzle
b) By using high velocity jet
c) Using small diameter and high velocity jet
d) Higher exhaust jet with less diameter of exhaust
