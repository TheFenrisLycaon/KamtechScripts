1. An aircraft does not emit any IR radiation.
a) True
b) False
b
2. In general, an IR detector will respond to?
a) Irradiance
b) Rotational fluid
c) Rotational force
d) RCS
a
3. Calculate the irradiance E in W/cm2 if, radiant intensity I is 10 W/sr and range R is 10cm.
a) 0.1
b) 0.001
c) 0.45
d) 10
a
Irradiance E is given by,
E = I/R2 = 10/102 = 10/100 = 0.1 W/cm2.
4. What is an IR signature of an aircraft?
a) Total of detectable emissions and reflections
b) Sum of some emissions only
c) Only reflections
d) Only refraction
a
5. Which of the following is primarily responsible for an IR signature?
a) Engine exhaust
b) Passenger
c) Fuel tank
d) Cabin crew
a
6. An aircraft is flying with Mach 2.0. Calculate recovery temperature if ambient temperature is 305K. Assume recovery factor is 0.85.
a) 512.4K
b) 253.2K
c) 100°C
d) 400°C
a
Assuming the recover factor as 0.85 and for such case,
Recovery temperature T2 = T1*(1+0.17*M2)
T2 = 305*(1+0.17*2*2) = 305*1.68 = 512.4K.
7. A military aircraft can use _____ as a countermeasure for IR detection.
a) flares
b) lift
c) glares
d) engine temperature increase
a
8. Plume emissions can be reduced by ___________
a) quickly mixing exhaust with outside air
b) increasing exhaust temperature
c) increasing engine outlet temperature
d) increasing plume temperature
a
9. Which of the following is one of the countermeasures for IR detection?
a) Decoy
b) Temperature increase
c) Engine exhaust temperature increase
d) Not mixing plume with outside air
a
10. Sun glint affects the IR detection of an aircraft.
a) True
b) False
a
11. To improve IR detection of engine, we can ____________
a) hide the nozzle from expected location of an IR sensor
b) use higher exhaust temperature
c) show nozzle at IR sensor
d) nozzle does not affect the IR detection
a
