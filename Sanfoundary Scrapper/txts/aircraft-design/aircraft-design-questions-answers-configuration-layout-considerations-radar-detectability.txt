1. RADAR stands for _________
a) radio detection and ranging
b) radio defense and rigging
c) radio determination and ranging
d) radio detection and rigging
a
2. Radar detection is one of the crucial consideration for military aircraft.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Typical radar system consists of _________
a) TX and Rx
b) Only TX
c) Only Rx
d) Does not require TX or Rx
a
4. A typical radar is located at 4 meter distance from an object. If radar transmits signal from that position then, signal strength S will be __________
a) proportional to (1/44)
b) proportional to (1/46)
c) proportional to 4
d) proportional to 1/4
a
Since, no other parameters have mentioned we will directly use the relation between strength and the distance to find required relation.
Typically, radar strength is proportional to (1/distance4) = (1/44).
5. RCS stands for __________
a) radar cross section
b) radar cone shape
c) radio conic shape
d) radio cruise and stall
a
6. RCS is the measure of ___________
a) the amount of EM energy is being returned by an object
b) how much weight is required
c) lift generated
d) radio cruise and stall properties
a
7. RCS can be altered by _________
a) altering the look angle
b) altering the drag force
c) altering the ram cruise and stall
d) altering the tail moment arm only
a
8. Comment on radar detectability if RCS is higher.
a) Higher detectability
b) Lower detectability
c) Same detectability
d) Detectability is not dependent on rcs
a
9. Which of the following will not affect the radar detectability of an aircraft?
a) Drag magnitude
b) Look angle
c) Flat surface
d) Stealth properties
a
10. Following diagram represents ____
a) Surface current scattering
b) Surface current explosion
c) Capturing area of surface
d) Lift vectors
a
11. RCS of flat surface can be reduced by _____
a) providing some slope to flat surface
b) increasing flat side length
c) using twice length of the flat side
d) provide more rcs to flat side
a
12. RCS can be reduce by using RAM only.
a) True
b) False
b
13. As a designer, we want to improve radar detectability of our aircraft. Where should we locate our warheads to achieve this goal?
a) Inside fuselage
b) Outside fuselage
c) Below wing
d) At wingtip
a
