1. Visual detection is based on?
a) A/C size, color, etc
b) Only size
c) Only weight
d) Only color
a
2. Visual detection is one of the important parameters for an aircraft.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Which of the following is correct?
a) Typically, in simulated combat we can detect large aircraft quickly than the smaller aircraft
b) Lift is always the same as weight
c) We cannot detect large aircraft at all
d) We can always find small aircraft
a
4. In order to reduce background contrast, we can provide ____________
a) camouflage pattern
b) red color pattern only
c) always use black color
d) always use red and black pattern
a
5. For ground background, camouflage paint scheme consists ______________

6. Camouflage patterns for sky background will include ______________
a) dirty blue-grey
b) clean red
c) clean pink
d) dirty red always
a
7. A. Typical aircraft will have lighter colors at lower surface.
R. The background lookup angle is sky.
a) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A] 
b) Both [A] and [R] are true but [R] is not the correct reason for [A] 
c) Both [A] and [R] are false
d) [A] is false but [R] is true
a
8. Higher contrast between different parts of aircraft will _____________
a) increase detectability
b) decrease
c) increases twice times always
d) always decreases by two units
a
9. Which of the following is correct?
a) Canopy glint can affect the visual detection of an aircraft
b) Canopy glint will have zero effect on visual detection
c) Weight is lift all time
d) Thrust is drag all the time
a
10. An observer is observing in an aircraft from distance of 2400 feet. If size of the aircraft can be given as 24000 feet then, what will be the simplified value of visual angle in minutes of arc? Consider all simplified environment and ideal conditions.
a) 34380
b) 3438
c) 343
d) 34
a
Visual angles in minutes of arcs = 3438*l/d = 3438*24000/2400 = 34380.
11. If my aircraft has luminance of 10 unit and is designed to operate in background which has luminance of 8 unit then, what will be the approximate value of contrast?
a) 0.25 unit
b) 1.25
c) 5.25unit
d) 5.26
a
Approximate contras value C = |L1-L2|/L2 = |10-8|/8 = 2/8 = 0.25 unit.
