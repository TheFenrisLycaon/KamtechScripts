1. What is the load path?
a) Structural elements by virtue of which opposing forces are connected
b) Structural elements by virtue of which similar forces are connected
c) Structural elements by virtue of which opposite moments are linked
d) Lifting path
a
2. We can minimize the weight of the structural member by _________

c) placing similar forces near to each other
d) placing only upward forces near to each other
a
3. Span-loading is defined as __________

6. Longerons are used to oppose __________
a) bending
b) expansion only
c) contraction only
d) drag
a
7. To decrease the weight of a typical commercial fuselage, stringers should be _________
a) straight and uninterrupted
b) straight and curved
c) interrupted at every point
d) only straight
a
8. Fuselage bending loads are carried by ___________
a) keelson
b) tail
c) nelson
d) ribs
a
9. If possible, we should avoid using any structural cutout.
a) True
b) False
a

a) wing box carrythrough
b) ring frames
c) bending beams
d) strut braced
a
11. Following diagram represents ______
a) ring frames
b) bending beams
c) strut braced
d) hybrid strut braced
a
12. Following diagram represents ______
a) bending beams
b) ring frames
c) strut braced

13. A wing has chord of 1m. Find the appropriate range of the front spar position from l.e.
a) 0.2m-0.3m
b) 0.9m-1.5m
c) 3.2
d) 1.2
a
Typical range of front spar location = 20% to 30% of chord = 20% of 1 to 30% of 1 = 0.2*1 to 0.3*1 = 0.2m-0.3m.
14. A spar is located at 65% of MAC from leading edge. If spar is positioned in such way that distance between t.e. and spar is 2m then, estimate chord of wing.
a) 5.71m
b) 6.8
c) 4.4
d) 6.5
a
Spar is located at 65% of chord from l.e. hence, from t.e. location of spar = (100% – 65%) of chord = 1-0.65 = 0.35*chord.
From given, 0.35*chord = 2m
Chord = 2/0.35 = 5.71m.
15. A typical large airliner has outer diameter of 20in. find the approximate value of diameter for passenger compartment.
a) 12in
b) 34in
c) 20in
d) 24in
a
Approximate radius of passenger compartment = external radius – structural thickness
= 10-4 = 6in
Hence, diameter = 2*6 = 12in.
