1. Vulnerability of an aircraft is ability of the aircraft ______________
a) to sustain damage, continue flying and return to base
b) to get damaged and failed
c) to the radar detection
d) to an IR detection
a
2. __________ is key parameter for vulnerability.
a) Vulnerable area
b) RCS
c) IR
d) Visual area
a
3. Vulnerable area will be same for each and every aircraft.
a) True
b) False
a
4. FMEA stands for?
a) Failure modes and effect analysis
b) Failure mass and effect analysis
c) Failure mass and effective analogy
d) Failure modes and effect analogy
a
5. FMEA will consider _____________
a) which battle damage can affect individual aircraft components?

6. We can improve vulnerability by _____________
a) avoiding fuel tanks near to the engine
b) placing fuel tanks on the engine
c) placing fuel tanks inside the engine
d) placing fuel tanks at any location
a
7. A firewall should be provided for vulnerability consideration.
a) True
b) False
a
8. In order to improve vulnerability consideration, we can use _________
a) redundant components
b) high lift device
c) vortex generator
d) we cannot improve it
a
9. An aircraft component has presented area 6 ft2 with Pk as 1.0. Find vulnerable area.
a) 6ft2
b) 82ft2
c) 7ft2
d) 72ft2
a
Vulnerable area = a*Pk = 6*1 = 6ft2.
10. If an aircraft has three components which can be considered as vulnerable components then, evaluate total vulnerable area. Given area of component 1, 2 and 3 are 5ft2, 4ft2 and 80ft2 respectively with Pk as 1, 0.5 and 0.3 for component 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
a) 31ft2
b) 50ft2
c) 10ft2
d) 4ft
a
Part 2: area a2=4ft2, pk2=0.5
Part 2: area a3=80ft2, pk3=0.3
Total vulnerable area = a1*pk1 + a2*pk2 + a3*pk3 = 5*1 + 4*0.5 + 80*0.3 = 5+2+24 = 31ft2.
