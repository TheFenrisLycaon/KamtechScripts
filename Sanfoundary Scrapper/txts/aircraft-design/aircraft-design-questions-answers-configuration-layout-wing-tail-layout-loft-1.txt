1. A wing is to be loft with span as 2m and reference area of wing is 4m2. If we want to design the wing with taper ratio of 0.6 then what will be the value of tip chord?
a) 2.5m
b) 2.50m
c) 2.65m
d) 25.6m
a
Now, root chord Cr is given by,
Cr = 2*s / b (1+t) = 2*4 / 2(0.6+1) = 8/2*1.6 = 2.5m.
2. Term marked by ’?’ in diagram is ________
a) tip chord
b) root chord
c) thrust
d) lift
a
3. Consider below wing. Calculate the value of span of wing marked by ‘?’.
a) 3.3m
b) 6.66m
c) 3.36m
d) 6.96m
a
Taper ratio t = Ct/Cr = 2/4 = 0.5.
Hence, wing span of given wing b/2 = S/Cr*(1+t) = 20/4*(1+0.5) = 20/4*1.5 = 3.3m.
4. Let’s consider flat wrapping is to be used for lofting. If wing has taper ratio of 0.4, span of 26.6ft and root chord Cr is 76in then, find the area to be covered by flat wrapping.
a) 118ft2
b) 200ft2
c) 1600in
d) 10m
a
Area S is given by,
S = Cr*b*(1+t)/2 = 912*26.6*(1+0.4)/2 = 16981.44 in2 = 16981.44/144 ft2 = 118ft2.
5. From following diagram find the value of MAC of wing.
a) 5.8m
b) 6.8m
c) 2.5m
d) 10m
a
MAC is given by,
MAC = (2/3)*Cr*((1+t+t2) / (1+t))
= (2/3)*10*((1+0.2+0.22) / (1+0.2)) = 5.79 = 5.8m.
6. Following graph represents ____
a) graphical method to find MAC
b) graphical method to produce drag
c) graphical method to find lift
d) graphical method to find lift-curve
a
7. For wing to be lofted as shown in below figure, what will be the approximated value of MAC?
a) 8m from l.e.
b) 8m from t.e.
c) 12m from l.e.
d) 12m from t.e.
a
Taper ratio t = Ct/Cr = 3/12 = 0.25.
Location of MAC, γ = (b/6)*(1+2*t) / (1+t) = (40/6)*(1+2*0.25) / (1+0.25) = 40*(1+0.5)/6*1.25 = 8m from l.e.
8. If wing has MAC of 8m then, what will be the location of aerodynamic centre?
a) 2m from l.e.
b) 2m from t.e.
c) At l.e.
d) At t.e.
a
Location of aerodynamic center = 25% of MAC = 25% of 8 = 0.25*8 = 2m from l.e.
9. Which of the following is correct in terms of the wing layout with twist?
a) Incidence at each span station must be considered and chord should be rotated accordingly
b) Only untwist airfoils can be used for layout
c) Only rotation of chord line is required at c/6 points
d) Only chord line should be rotated by reducing length of chord
a
10. Which of the following is correct?
a) Generally, tip airfoils are selected for stall characteristics
b) Always root airfoils are elected for stall characteristics
c) Wing twist will increase thrust by engine
d) Wing twist is not considered for layout
a
11. In linear interpolation method, new airfoil is created as ____________
a) weighted average of root and tip airfoil
b) heavier than the root airfoil always
c) higher chord than root always
d) lower chord than tip always
a
12. A constant percent chord line is drawn from root airfoil to tip airfoil in linear interpolation method.
a) True
b) False
a
