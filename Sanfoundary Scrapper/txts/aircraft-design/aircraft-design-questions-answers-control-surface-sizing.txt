1. If a wing has span of 12m. Find the approximated length of the aileron of starboard wing.
a) 2.4m
b) 20m
c) 15m
d) 25m
a
Given, Span of wing b=12m. Since we need to find aileron length at one wing we will divide total wing span by 2.
Hence span of starboard wing = 12/2 = 6m.
Length of aileron at starboard wing (right wing) = |difference between 50% and 90% of span|
= |50% of 6m – 90% of 6m| = |0.5*6-0.9*6| = 2.4m.
2. High speed aircraft is affected by ____________
a) aileron reversal
b) flap inversion
c) drafting
d) independent from any disturbances
a
3. We can reduce aileron reversal by adopting ____________
a) inboard aileron
b) inboard fuel
c) thrust reversal
d) thrust decrement
a
4. Rolling tails can be used by high speed A/C.
a) True
b) False
a
5. Determine the corrections or otherwise of the following assertion [A] and reason [R]:
Assertion [A]: Typically control surface are tapered with same taper ratio as primary component such as wing or tail
Reason[R]: Control surface is used to provide trim control to the A/C
a) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A] 
b) Both [A] and [R] are true but [R] is not the correct reason for [A] 
c) Both [A] and [R] are false
d) [A] is false but [R] is true
b
6. Rapid oscillations of control surface due to application of the air loads is termed as __________
a) control surface flutter
b) control surface span
c) control surface trim
d) control surface effectiveness
a
7. Following diagram represents ______
a) notched aerodynamic balance
b) fluttered balance
c) overhorn balance
d) overhung balance
a
8. Following diagram represents _____
a) overhung aerodynamic balance
b) overhorn balance
c) horn balance
d) notched balance
a
9. Determine elevator chord if tail chord is 1m.
a) 0.25m-0.5m
b) 2.5m
c) 1.8m
d) 1.5-2m
a
In typical aircraft, elevator chord is 25% to 50% of tail chord.
Elevator chord = 25% of T.C. to 50% of T.C. = 25% of 1 to 50% of 1
= 0.25*1 to 0.5*1 = 0.25m-0.50m.
10. If vertical tail has length of the 2m then, find the value of rudder length.
a) 1.8m
b) 2.8m
c) 2m
d) 2.5m
a
For, typical aircraft rudder is extended up to 90% of the length of the vertical tail.
Hence, Rudder length = 90% of tail length = 90% of 2m = 0.9*2m = 1.8m.
