6. Which range of pilot size are used to design a typical military aircraft?
a) Size from 5th to 95th percentile for male pilots
b) Size from 0th to 2nd percentile
c) Size of 3rd percentile always
d) Size doesn’t concern of design
a
7. Determine approximate value of approach angle if, overnose angle is 20° and approach speed is 100knots.
a) 13°
b) 5°
c) 2°
d) 3°
a
Now, Approach angle A is given by,
A = O – 0.07*V = 20 – 0.07*200 = 13°.
8. Following diagram represents ____
a) typical fighter cockpit
b) typical glider
c) typical empennage
d) wing layout
a
9. Seat reference point is the point where?
a) Seat pan meets the back
b) Pilot head is located
c) Lift is concentrated
d) Weight is carried out in cockpit
a
10. Overnose angle is defined based on?
a) Pilot’s eye point
b) Seat reference point
c) Seat length
d) CG of aircraft
a
11. Higher seat back angle (>60°) will result in __________
a) improvement to withstand high- g loads
b) drag increment
c) outside vision improvement
d) maximum drag
a
12. Overnose vision angle will be same for all aircrafts.
a) True
b) False
a
13. Which of the following is correct?
a) Overnose angle = approach angle + 0.07*approach speed (in knots)
b) Overnose angle = (approach angle)2 + 7*approach speed (in knots)
c) Overnose angle = (approach angle)2
d) Approach angle = (Overnose angle)2
a
14. A typical a/c has approach speed of 100 knots. If approach angle is 10° then, estimate value of overnose angle.
a) 17°
b) 25°
c) 10°
d) 40°
a
Now, overnose angle = a+0.07*V = 10 + 0.07*100 = 17°.
15. What is the grazing angle?
a) Smallest angle between pilot’s line of vision and the cockpit windscreen
b) Same as over nose angle
c) Seat back angle
d) Seat reference angle
