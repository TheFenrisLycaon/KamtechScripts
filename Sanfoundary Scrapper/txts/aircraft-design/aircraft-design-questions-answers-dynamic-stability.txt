1. Which of the following is correct?
a) Aircraft which is statically stable may or may not be dynamically stable
b) Lift is equal to weight always
c) Thrust is only proportional to nose of aircraft
d) Drag is useful during takeoff
a
2. Dynamic stability is more concerned about time.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Damping ratio is defined as __________
a) damping coefficient divided by critical damping coefficient

6. If damping ratio is unity then, system is _____________
a) critically damped
b) over damped
c) high lift device
d) thrust augmented
a
7. Consider the aircraft with weight of 1234 kg. Find the approximate value of the damping ratio if time taken by system for damping is minimum.
a) 1
b) 1.7
c) 1.9
d) 0.002
a
For, critical damping ratio is defined as,
Damping ratio = damping coefficient/critical damping coefficient = Cc/Cc = 1.
8. Find critical damping coefficient if damping ratio is 0.5 and damping coefficient is 1.1.
a) 2.2
b) 1
c) 4
d) 1.1
a
9. Which of the following is not the type of aircraft dynamic mode?
a) Flap
b) Dutch roll
c) Phugoid
d) Lateral mode
a
10. Which of the following is an example of longitudinal mode?
a) Phugoid
b) Dutch
c) Lateral
d) Aileron
a
11. Consider the 2d phugoid approximation with natural frequency of 0.4. Determine the approximate value of aircraft speed.
a) 34.68
b) 56
c) 12
d) 12.68
a
Approximate value of aircraft speed = 1.414*g/w = 1.414*9.81/0.4 = 34.68 m/s.
12. If damping ratio is 0.05 then, find the lift to drag ratio. Consider 2-degree phugoid approximation.
a) 14.14
b) 20
c) 25
d) 0.05
a
Lift to drag = 0.707/d = 0.707/0.05 = 14.14.
13. Which of the following is correct?
a) Dutch roll is not considered as a longitudinal mode
b) Lift curve slope is defined as ratio of lift to thrust
c) Stability and controllability are same
d) Dynamic stability of aircraft does not depend upon any parameter
