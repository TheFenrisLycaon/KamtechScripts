1. An aircraft wing is experiencing AOA of 5°. If downwash due to wing is 2.6° then, how much angle is being seen by tail of the aircraft?
a) 2.4°
b) 4.5°
c) 6.7°
d) 1.23°
a
2. Following diagram represents __________
a) cg position influence on moment coefficient curve
b) lift curve
c) drag polar
d) thrust required minimum
a
3. If an aircraft has lift curve slope of 4.76 per rad and moment coefficient curve slope of -0.116 per rad then, find the location of neutral point. Consider Xcg=0.3.
a) 0.324
b) 0.9825
c) 23.45
d) 45.7
a
= 0.3 – 0.116/4.76 = 0.3-0.024 = 0.324.
4. Canard will provide longitudinal static stability.
a) False
b) True
a
5. Thrust will affect the stability of the aircraft.
a) True
b) False
a
6. Determine trim angle if, trim lift coefficient is 0.75 and lift curve slope is 4.5per rad. Consider elevator deflection as 1.056 per rad and trim elevator angle of 0.020 rad.
a) 0.1619 rad
b) 0.1619°
c) 2.98 rad
d) 34.23 rad
a
Trim angle = [C-e*E]/c
= [0.75-1.056*0.020]/4.5
= [0.75-0.02112]/4.5
= 0.728/4.5 = 0.1619 rad.
7. Find elevator control power in per rad.

-2.5
a) -0.0166 per rad
b) -12.33
c) 0.0015 per rad
d) 0.098 per °
a
= 0.02-0.08/(1.1-(-2.5)) = -0.0166 per rad.
8. Determine required static margin if lift curve slope is 6.5 per rad and pitching moment coefficient slope as -0.58 per rad.
a) 8.9%
b) 78%
c) 0.89
d) 8.403
a
= -(-0.58/6.5) = 0.089 = 0.089*100% = 8.9%. 
9. If SM = 0.12 and cg is located at 20% chord from l.e. then, find appropriate neutral point location.
a) 0.32
b) 0.87
c) 2.3
d) 1.54
a
Neutral point position = SM + Xcg = 0.12 + 0.2 = 0.32.
10. Find the appropriate value of pitching moment coefficient derivative if lift curve slope is 0.032 per degree and Xcg is 0.3. Consider neutral point is located at 60 % of chord from leading edge.
a) -0.0096 per degree
b) -7 per degree
c) 2.56 per degree
d) 0.1
a
Neutral point is located at 60% of chord i.e. Xnp = 0.6.
Pitching moment derivative = -C*[Xnp-Xcg] = -0.0032*[0.6-0.2] = -0.0096 per degree.
11. A rectangular wing has chord of 2m. Fond neutral point for this wing.
a) 50 cm
b) 290 cm
c) 189 cm
d) 267 m
a
12. If CM0 is -0.052 and lift coefficient at zero angle CL0 is 0.92 then, find CMac. Consider rectangular wing.
a) -0.282
b) 0.98
c) 2.5
d) 7.89
a
For a typical rectangle wing, Xcg-Xac =0.25.
Hence, CMac = CM0 + CL0*0.25 = -0.052+0.95*0.25 = -0.282.
13. Elevator control power is given by _____
a) \(\frac{dCm}{d\delta e}\) 
b) Zero lift drag
c) T = CD0 + K*CL
d) DCL/ɑ
a
14. Determine the corrections or otherwise of the following Assertion [A] and Reason [R]:
Assertion [A]: For longitudinal static stability of an aircraft, slope of moment curve should be negative.
Reason[R]: Positive slope will result in more static stability than negative slope. Hence, slope should be positive always.
a) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A] 
b) Both [A] and [R] are true but [R] is not the correct reason for [A] 
c) [A] is true but [R] is false
d) [A] is false but [R] is true
c
15. Which of the following is correct to trim an aircraft at positive AOA?
a) Cm0 > 0
b) Cm0 < 0
c) Cm0 will not affect positive trim AOA
d) Every value of cm0 will trim at positive AOA
a
