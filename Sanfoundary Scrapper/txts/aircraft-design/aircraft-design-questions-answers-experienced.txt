1. Thrust loading is defined as ____________
a) ratio of thrust produced by an engine to the weight of the aircraft
b) ratio of lift to thrust
c) ratio of drag to thrust
d) ratio of lift to weight
a
2. What is thrust matching?
a) Comparison of the engine’s available thrust at cruise to the estimated drag of aircraft
b) Comparison of the engine’s available thrust at cruise to the estimated weight of aircraft
c) Comparison of the engine’s available lift at cruise to the estimated drag of aircraft
d) Comparison of the engine’s available power at cruise to the estimated drag of aircraft
a
3. At idle cruise condition, thrust loading is equal to ______
a) drag to lift ratio at cruise
b) drag to power ratio
c) lift to drag ratio
d) aerodynamic efficiency
a
4. For an aircraft cruise aerodynamic efficiency is 10. Find the thrust loading at cruise.
a) 0.1
b) 0.01
c) 0.4
d) 0.5
a
Thrust loading at cruise T/W = 1 / (L/D) = 1/10 = 0.1.
5. A typical jet airliner has cruise thrust to weight ratio of 0.5. Determine at which aerodynamic efficiency this airliner is flying.
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
a
Thrust loading at cruise T/W = 1 / (L/D)
Hence, Aerodynamic efficiency (L/D) at cruise is,
L/D = 1 / (T/W) = 1/0.5 = 2.
6. A jet aircraft has maximum lift to drag as 12. Find the value of the thrust loading at the cruise.
a) 0.096
b) 0.0069
c) 0.96
d) 0.0096
a
Thrust loading at cruise T/W = 1 / (L/D at cruise)
For, jet aircraft cruise lift to drag = 86.6% of maximum lift to drag = 86.6% of 12 = 0.866*12 = 10.392
Now, thrust loading at cruise,
Thrust loading at cruise T/W = 1 / (L/D at cruise)
= 1/10.392 = 0.096.
7. Power available for prop will vary with density.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Consider thrust is given as 120 N of force then, find the value of thrust in terms of pound of force.
a) 26.97 pound of force
b) 125 pound
c) 12.56 lb
d) 120 KN
a
9. If weight of an aircraft is increased then, thrust loading will _______
a) increase
b) decrease
c) will not change
d) exact half always
b
10. A twin turbo prop is flying with power loading of 12. What will be the maximum velocity?
a) 48.225 mph
b) 48.225 m/s
c) 48.225 km/h
d) 225.48 m/h
a
P.L. is given by,
W/hp =  1 / (a*Vmaxc), for twin turbo prop a=0.012, c=0.5.
Hence, maximum velocity Vmax is given by,
12 = 1 / (0.012*Vmax0.5)
0.012*Vmax0.5 = 1/12.
Vmax0.5 = 1 / (0.012*12) = 6.944
Takin log at both sides,
0.5*ln (Vmax) = ln (6.944) = 1.937
Now, taking anti-log,
Vmax = e(1.937/0.5) = e3.875 = 48.225mph.
11. An A/C is cruising with thrust to weight of 0.9. If A/C is powered by prop engine then, find maximum lift to drag?
a) 1.11
b) 2.11
c) 3.12
d) 4.221
a
For prop aircraft maximum L/D = Cruise L/D
Hence, T.L. = D/L.
Hence, cruise L/D = 1/(T/W) = 1/0.9 = 1.11.
12. An A/C is flying with thrust loading at take-off is 0.9. If thrust at take-off and cruse is equal then, determine the thrust loading during cruise.
a) 0.941
b) 0.951
c) 0.961
d) 0.98
a
Cruise thrust loading is given by,
(T/W)cruise = (T/W)take-off * (Wtake-off / Wcruise).
For cruise Wcruise = 0.956 * Wtake-off
Hence,
(T/W)cruise = (T/W)take-off * (Wtake-off / 0.956*Wtake-off) = 0.9/0.956 = 0.941.
