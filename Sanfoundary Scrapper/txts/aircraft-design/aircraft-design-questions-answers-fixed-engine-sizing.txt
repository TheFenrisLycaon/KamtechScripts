1. Based on existing engine or based on new design, aircraft sizing can be done.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Existing engine used for sizing is called as __________
a) fixed engine
b) unfixed engine
c) differential engine
d) rubber engine
a
3. The thrust developed by fixed engine will be ___________
a) fixed during sizing
b) unfixed during sizing
c) independent of engine
d) zero at sizing
a
4. Size of fixed engine can vary during sizing.
a) True
b) False
b
5. Why we use fixed engine for aircraft sizing?
a) Cost effective
b) Can be stretched
c) Can be rubberized
d) Can provide variable thrust at sizing
a
6. Fixed engine sizing method is adopted for aircraft. If thrust per engine is 20000 unit and thrust loading T.L. is 0.8 then, find the take-off gross weight. Given aircraft has 2 engines.
a) 50000 unit
b) 58000 unit
c) 50822
d) 32589 unit
a
Now, take-off gross weight is given by,
W = N*T / (T.L.) = 2*20000/0.8 = 50000 unit.
7. As a designer let’s consider that we want to build an aircraft weighing 28000 units at take-off. How many engine will require if our thrust loading T.L. is 0.71 and thrust per engine is 10000 unit?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 1
a
Now, take-off gross weight is 28000 units.
Now, number engines required is given by,
N = W*T.L. / T = 28000*0.71/10000 = 1.98.
We cannot use 1.98 engines so we will take the nearest integer. Hence, the answer will be 2.
8. An aircraft needs to accelerate from 0.8M to 2.0M. What should be the mission segment weight fraction if fixed engine sizing is used?
a) 0.956
b) 0.9365
c) 0.937
d) 0.98052
a
Similarly, for 0.1M to 2.0M we required a fuel fraction of 0.937 typically.
Now to find fuel fraction for aircraft from 0.8M to 2.0M is given by,
Fuel fraction = (required fuel fraction for 0.1M to 2.0M)/(required fuel fraction for 0.1M to 0.8M)
= 0.937 / 0.9805 = 0.956.
9. Which of the following is disadvantage of fixed engine sizing?
a) Often requires compromise in mission range or performance
b) Less costly compared to rubber engine
c) Availability is more than rubber engine
d) Has no disadvantage
a
10. Which of the following is correct?
a) W0 = N*T per engine / Thrust loading
b) W0 = Number of engine
c) W0 = T per engine / Thrust loading
d) W0 = 1 / Thrust loading
