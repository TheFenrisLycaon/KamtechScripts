a
6. Find the required amount of touchdown speed if stall speed is 100knots.
a) 115 knot
b) 120 knot
c) 100 knot
d) 99.2 knot
a
7. If stall speed is 120 knots then, find average velocity at flare.
a) 147.6
b) 120
c) 110
d) 567
a
8. For military aircraft touchdown speed is 100 knots then, approximate value of stall speed.

a
9. Find the required average velocity during flare for military aircraft if stall speed is 45 unit.
a) 51.75 unit
b) 60 unit
c) 45 unit
d) 100 unit
a
10. Determine the value of FAR field length. Consider approach of 100 ft., flare of 120 feet and ground roll of 600ft.
