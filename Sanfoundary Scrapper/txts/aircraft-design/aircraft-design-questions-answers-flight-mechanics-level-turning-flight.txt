1. Corner speed is defined as __________
a) velocity for maximum instantaneous turn
b) maximum lift velocity
c) maximum aerodynamic efficiency
d) minimum instantaneous turn speed
a
2. During level turning flight, lift of wing is canted.
a) True
b) False
a
3. If load factor of level turning flight is found to be 1.2 and flight speed is 120m/s then, determine turn rate.
a) 3.107 degree/s
b) 1.2 rad/s
c) 0.03 rad per second
d) 1.2
a
Turn rate = \(\frac{g*\sqrt{n^2-1}}{v}\) 
= \(\frac{9.81*\sqrt{1.2^2-1}}{120}\) 
= 0.054 rad/s = 3.107 degree/s.
4. Let’s consider we are designing an aircraft which can have 0.075 rad/s as its turn rate during level turning operation. If load factor is set to be 1.1 then, at which velocity we should fly our aircraft to obtain mentioned requirement.
a) 59.8unit
b) 590unit
c) 5980unit
d) 0894unit
a
Velocity V = \(\frac{g*\sqrt{n^2-1}}{turn \,rate}\) 
= \(\frac{9.81*\sqrt{1.2^2-1}}{0.075}\) = 59.8 unit.
5. Following diagram represents ____________
a) level turn
b) lift curve slope
c) mach number limit
d) drag polar
a
6. During level turning operation my aircraft has load factor of 2. Find the required bank angle for this level turning operation.
a) 60°
b) 60rad
c) 120rad
d) 2.1rad
a
7. What will be the turn radius if flight speed is 50unit and load factor is 2? Consider Level turn.
a) 147.13unit
b) 180unit
c) 50unit
d) 20unit
a
Turn radius = \(\frac{v*v}{g*\sqrt{n^2-1}}\) 
= \(\frac{50*50}{9.81*\sqrt{2^2-1}}\) 
= 147.13 unit.
8. If an aircraft can slow down during turn then, it is termed as __________
a) instantaneous turn
b) non instantaneous turn
c) straight flight
d) cruise segment
a
9. Following diagram represents _____________
a) sustained turn rate envelope
b) instantaneous turn rate
c) power required diagram at 3 km
d) lift curve for wing
a
10. The aircraft _____________ during a sustained turn.
a) cannot be slowed down
b) can be slowed down
c) can lower its velocity
d) can increase lofting process effort
a
11. An aircraft is in sustained turn with thrust loading of 0.8 and aerodynamic efficiency of 6. Determine the approximate value of maximum load factor.
a) 4.8
b) 3
c) 1
d) 12
a
12. Term marked by ’?’ in the following diagram is called __________
a) corner speed
b) dive speed
c) cruise speed
d) free stream velocity
a
13. An aircraft weighing 200kg is in level turning operation. Find the value of vertical component of lift.
a) 1.962 KN
b) 200N
c) 2KN
d) 0.2KN
a
Weight = 200*9.81 = 1962 N. At Level turn, Vertical component of lift is equal to weight.
Hence, for given level turning flight Maneuver, vertical component of lift = weight = 1962N = 1.962KN.
14. Turn rate is defined as _______
a) ratio of radial acceleration and the velocity
b) ratio of lift to drag
c) product of thrust and velocity
d) drag
a
