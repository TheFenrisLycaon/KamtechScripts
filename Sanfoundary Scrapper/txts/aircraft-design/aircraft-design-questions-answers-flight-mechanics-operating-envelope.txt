1. Falling diagram represents _________
a) operating envelope
b) lift curve
c) tire sizing
d) empty weight diagram
a
2. The level flight envelope is determined by ________
a) stall limit lines and from zero specific power
b) wing aileron size
c) spoilers area
d) tail area
a
3. The highest altitude where Ps is zero is called ________
a) absolute ceiling
b) drag polar
c) geometric height
d) geometric altitude
a
4. Which of the following is incorrect?
a) Operating envelope will give same values for all the aircraft
b) Load factor at cruise is unity
c) Lift is same as weight during cruise
d) Wing loading is not same as thrust
a
5. Operating envelope is also known as ________
a) flight envelope
b) fly by wire
c) stall speed diagram
d) lift curve
a
6. If static pressure of flow is 1200psf and operating Mach number is 1.19 then, determine the external flow dynamic pressure.
a) 1189.52 psf
b) 12.89 psf
c) 112 psf
d) 2587 psf
a
= 0.7*1200*1.192  = 1189.52 psf.
7. Determine static pressure if external flow dynamic pressure is 1800psf and flow has Mach number of 2.
a) 642.857psf
b) 1000psf
c) 2400 psf
d) 4673 psf
a
= 1800 / (0.7*22) = 642.857 psf.
8. Consider external flow dynamic pressure as 2000psf and static pressure as 800psf. find the approximate value of Mach number.
a) 1.9
b) 5
c) 4.5
d) 2.78
a
= (2000 / (0.7*800))0.5
= 3.5710.5 = 1.88 = 1.9.
9. Determine total pressure if static pressure is 1600psf and Mach number is 1.8. Consider flow of air.
a) 9193.2 psf
b) 1000 psf
c) 3450 psf
d) 7892 psf
a
= 1600[1+0.2*1.8*1.8]3.5
= 1600*1.6483.5 = 9193.2 psf.
10. If flow has Mach number of 1.2 then, determine the ratio of total and external flow dynamic pressure.
a) 2.4
b) 1
c) 3.8
d) 5.6
a
Ratio of total pressure and external flow dynamic pressure = (1.428/M2)*[1+0.2*M2]3.5
= (1.428/1.22)*[1+0.2*1.22]3.5
= (1.428/1.22)*[1+0.288]3.5
= 2.40.
