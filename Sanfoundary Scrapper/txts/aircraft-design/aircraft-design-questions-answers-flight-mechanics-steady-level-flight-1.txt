1. Find climb angle of climb gradient is 0.6. Assume non accelerated flight.
a) 31°
b) 1.2
c) 4.5rad
d) 9.94°
a
Now, climb angle = arctan (G) = arctan (0.6) = 30.9 ∼ 31°.
2. If my aircraft is in steady level flight and has thrust of 100 unit then, what will be the approximate value of time Easter if change of aircraft weight. Consider SFC as C unit.
a) -100C
b) 1000
c) 1.25
d) 5.43
a
Now, time rate of change of aircraft weight = -C*T = -100*C = -100C.
3. Which of the following is correct for steady level flight?
a) T=D
b) T>D
c) D<T
d) L>W
a
4. An aircraft has to be designed to operate at aerodynamic efficiency of 10 at cruise. Find the required thrust to weight ratio for maintaining this unaccelerated steady level flight.
a) 0.1
b) 0.6
c) 1.5
d) 10.45
a
Now, for given conditions, thrust to weight ratio T/W is given by,
T/W = D/L = 1/10=0.1.
5. Following diagram represents ______________
a) drag polar
b) weight polar
c) thrust polar
d) lift curve slope
a
6. An aircraft is designed with lift coefficient of 1.1 during steady level flight. If dynamic pressure is set to be 25.65 Pa then find weight of aircraft during this flight condition.
a) 28.215 N per unit area
b) 30 kg
c) 59 N
d) 125.25 N
a
Lift coefficient CL=1.1, q=25.65Pa.
Since, area is not mentioned we will find weight as per unit area.
Weight can be given by,
W = q*S*CL = 25.65*1.1 = 28.215 N per area.
7. If an aircraft is in steady level flight and weighs 2500 kg then, find lift at the given flight condition.
a) 24.525KN
b) 24525kg
c) 2500 N
d) 35000kg
a
Lift = m*g = 2500*9.81=24525N = 24.525 KN.
8. An aircraft is designed to be in steady level flight with weight of 1500N and CL of 1.0. Determine at which speed we need to design this aircraft so that it can achieve this requirement. Consider density as 1.2 kg/m3 and reference area as 2m2.
a) 35.35m/s
b) 56m/min
c) 56m/s
d) 70km/s
a
Now, velocity is given by,
V = \(\sqrt{\frac{2*W}{density*S*CL}}\) 
= \(\sqrt{\frac{2*1500}{1.2*1.0*2}}\)  = 35.35m/s.
9. Let’s consider our aircraft has to generate thrust of 150KN during cruise. If at the cruise thrust loading is 0.86 then, at which value of Lift our aircraft is flying?
a) 174.4KN
b) 450KN
c) 100N
d) 174N
a
L = Thrust/Thrust loading = 150/0.86 = 174.41KN.
10. Which of the following is correct?
a) Thrust required is minimum if L/D is maximum during cruise
b) Thrust required is minimum if L/D is minimum for cruise
c) Power required is minimum if L/D is maximum
d) Thrust required is maximum if L/D is maximum during steady state
a
11. We can design our aircraft to cruise for 3 different lift to drag ratio. Lift to drag ratio are as follows: 10, 12 and 11.25. Now, if we want to reduce thrust required to fly then, at which value of lift to drag ratio our aircraft needs to be designed so that it can operate with minimum thrust required?
a) 12
b) 10
c) 11.25
d) 10.62
a
From given values, 12 is the highest value available. Hence, among given choices correct choice would be 12.
12. Find the velocity for minimum thrust required at steady level flight if wing loading is 75N/m2 and induced drag factor K is 0.0025. Consider CD0 as 0.02 and density as sea level.
a) 6.45m/s
b) 97m/s
c) 120m/s
d) 75m/s
a
13. If lift coefficient at thrust required minimum is 0.85 and induced drag factor K is 0.0085 then, find the approximate value of drag coefficient at zero lift.
a) 0.0061
b) 0.061
c) 0.61
d) 6.1
a
Now, zero lift drag coefficient for given conditions,
CD0 = CL2/K = 0.85*0.85/0.0085 = 0.0061.
14. Which of the following is required condition of thrust required minimum?
a) CL = (CD0/K)0.5
b) CL = (CD0)*0.21
c) CL = (CD0/K)*1.5
d) CL = 0.5
a
15. Find the drag at which thrust required is minimum. Consider CD0 as 0.015 and reference area is 5m2. Consider steady level flight with q of 15Pa.
a) 2.25N
b) 22.5N
c) 225N
d) 2250N
a
015, q as 15Pa. Reference area S = 5m2.
Now, drag at thrust required minimum is given by,
D = 2*CD0*q*S = 2*0.015*15*5=2.25N.
