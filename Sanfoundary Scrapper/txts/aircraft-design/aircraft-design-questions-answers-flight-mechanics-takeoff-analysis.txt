1. Following diagram represents ____________
a) segments of typical takeoff
b) landing phase
c) cruise to climb mission segment
d) approach
a
2. Segment marked by ‘?’ in the diagram is called ________
a) typical ground roll
b) cruise path
c) flight path angle
d) free stream velocity
a
3. Which of the following is not part of takeoff?
a) Ground roll
b) Transition
c) Climb
d) Descending
a
4. Determine the acceleration of an aircraft which is in ground roll segment. Consider weight of the aircraft as 150kN, thrust as 110kN and drag as 10kN. Assume weight on the wheels as 60kN and rolling friction as 0.05.
a) 5.68 m/s2
b) 100kN
c) 100 m
d) 3.5689 Kg*m/s
a
Acceleration a = g*(T- D – f*w)/W
= 9.81(100 -10-0.05*60)/150
= 9.81*87/150 = 5.68 m/s2.
5. Which of the following is correct?
a) Ground roll = 0.5 * \(\int_{Vi}^{Vf}(\frac{1}{a})dV^2\) 
b) Ground roll = \(\int_{Vi}^{Vf}(\frac{1}{a})dV^2\) 
c) Ground roll = 0.5 / \(\int_{Vi}^{Vf}(\frac{1}{a})dV^2\) 
d) Ground roll = \(\int_{Vi}^{Vf}dV^2\)

6. If stall speed of the aircraft is 10m/s then, find the approximate value of takeoff speed.
a) 11m/s
b) 1m/s
c) 9m/s
d) 7m/s
a
7. If our design has takeoff velocity of 120 knots then, at which value of stall speed we should design our aircraft?
a) 109.08knots
b) 110 knots
c) 150 knots
d) 125 knots
a
8. Find liftoff distance for an aircraft which has weight of 20kN and thrust of 8kN. Consider thrust is much larger than drag and friction parameters. Consider maximum lift coefficient of 1.1, reference area of 12m2 and sea-level density.
a) 454m
b) 1000m
c) 12m
d) 12.12m
a
Liftoff distance = 1.44*W2/ (g*d*S*CL*T) = 1.44*(200002) / (9.81*1.225*1.1*12*8000) = 453.89 = 454m.
9. Find the average velocity at transition if, stall speed is 15 unit.
a) 17.25 unit
b) 19 unit
c) 30 unit
d) 45 unit
a
10. If climb speed during takeoff is 120 unit then, find stall speed.
a) 100knots
b) 240knots
c) 1267knots
d) 215knots
a
11. If Stall speed is 140fps then, find approximate radius of transition arc.
a) 4018 feet
b) 5015 km
c) 1m
d) 10cm
a
= 0.205*140*140
= 4018 feet.
12. Find the horizontal distance travelled during transition segment. Consider radius of transition arc is 2km and thrust loading is 0.6 and L/D is 5.
a) 800m
b) 8000m
c) 80m
d) 0.80m
a
Now, the horizontal distance H = r*(t – D/L)
= 2*(0.6-0.2) = 0.8 km = 800m.
