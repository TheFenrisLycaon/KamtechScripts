1. The purpose of fuselage is ___________
a) to provide space for cargo and passenger
b) to provide thrust
c) to provide high lift
d) to increase maximum lift
a
2. Fineness ratio of fuselage is ratio of _____________
a) fuselage length and maximum diameter
b) fuselage diameter
c) fuselage diameter and maximum length
d) length of fuselage and weight
a
3. An aircraft is flying with fuselage having length of 1.5m and fineness ratio of 15. At which maximum diameter fuselage should be designed?
a) 0.1m
b) 0.25m
c) 5m
d) 20.5m
a
Now, diameter D = l/F = 1.5/15 = 0.1m.
4. Jet transport aircraft has 12m length of the fuselage. What will be the approximated value for take-off gross weight?
a) 820.68kg
b) 850kg
c) 520kg
d) 1025g
a
Now, length is given by,
L = a*W0c
Now, for jet transport aircraft a=0.67, c=0.43
Hence, take-off gross weight is W0c = L/a
W00.43 = 12/0.67 = 17.91.
Now by taking log at both side,
0.43*ln W0 = ln17.91 = 2.885
lnW0 = 6.710
Hence, by using antilog,
W0 = e6.710 = 820.68kg.
5. A jet fighter has take-off gross weight of 10000 units. Find the appropriate length of the fuselage.
a) 34 unit
b) 34.5
c) 35 unit
d) 35.65
a
Now, length is given by,
L = a*W0c
Now, for jet fighter aircraft a=0.93, c=0.39
Hence, length of fuselage is,
L = 0.93*100000.39 = 33.76 = 34unit.
6. Find the wing reference area if wing loading is 85 lb/ft2 and aircraft has gross weight of 10000 lb.
a) 117.64 ft2
b) 112.65 ft2
c) 152 ft2
d) 125 ft2
a
W.L. = W0/area, area = W0/ W.L. = 10000/85 = 117.64 ft2.
7. The distance marked by ‘Lht’ represents _____
a) tail moment arm
b) tail area
c) fuselage area
d) wing length
a

8. Which of the following is correct for vertical tail (VT)?
a) Cvt = Lvt*Svt/(bwing*Swing)
b) Cvt = Lvt/(bwing*Swing)
c) Cvt = Svt/(bwing*Swing)
d) Cvt = Lvt*Svt
a
9. If Cvt = 0.05 then, find the vertical tail area. Given wing span b is 2m, wing area S=10m2 and tail moment arm Lvt=1m.
a) 1m2
b) 1cm2
c) 1in2
d) 1.2cm2
a
Tail moment arm Lvt is directly given so Lvt=1m.
Now, tail area Svt is given by,
Svt = Cvt*b*S/Lvt = 0.05*2*10/1 = 1m2.
10. If length of typical fuselage is 20m then, find the approximate range for control canard moment arm.
a) 6m-10m
b) 2-5cm
c) 5-9in
d) 11-20m
a
Typical range for canard (control) moment arm = 30% to 50% of the length
= 30% of L to 50% of L = 30% of 20 to 50% of 20
= 0.3*20 to 0.5*20 = 6m – 10m.
11. A typical jet transport aircraft needs to be sized based on following parameters. Wing area S=50m2, MAC=5m. If tail volume coefficient of horizontal tail is 1 and tail area is 10m2 then, find the required tail moment arm.
a) 25m
b) 50m
c) 25cm
d) 65in
a
