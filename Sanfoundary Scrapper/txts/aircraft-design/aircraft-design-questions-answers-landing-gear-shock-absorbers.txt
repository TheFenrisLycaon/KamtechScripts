1. What is the function of the undercarriage?
a) To absorb the shock during landing
b) To provide lift
c) To increase lift at landing
d) To carry cargo at airport
a
2. A typical glider will solely rely on tires for shock absorption.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Which of the following is an example of a shock absorber?
a) Solid spring shock arrangement
b) Lift curve slope
c) Flap
d) Elevator
a
4. Which of the following is correct?
a) Solid spring shock absorber is heavier than the other types
b) Lift to drag ratio is always unity
c) Weight at takeoff is same as weight at landing
d) Thrust is same as drag always
a
5. Which of the following is correct?
a) The solid spring year deflects with some lateral motion

6. Which type of shock absorber is most widely used nowadays?
a) Oleo
b) Signal beam type
c) Aurora beam type
d) Longerons type always
a
7. Following diagram represents ____________
a) simple oleo schematic
b) drag polar
c) wheel base distance only
d) wheel track only
a
8. Stroke of a shock absorber is defined as _________
a) required deflection of the shock absorbing system
b) lift required at takeoff
c) length of crank shaft of engine
d) piston distance travelled inside engine
a
9. If an aircraft has sink speed at touchdown as 9 ft/s then, find the stroke in inches approximately.
a) 9 in
b) 19 in
c) 1 in
d) 2 in
a
Required stroke in inch = vertical or sink speed = 9 inch.
10. If a tire has diameter of 18 in and rolling radius of 6 in then, what will be the approximate value of stroke of the tire?
a) 3 in
b) 4 in
c) 5 in
d) 8 in
a
= (18/2) – 6
= 9 – 6 = 3 in.
11. Determine the gear load factor if landing weight is 250 unit and average total load during deflection is 550 unit.
a) 2.2
b) 4
c) 4.5
d) 8.9
a
Load factor N = average load/ weight during landing
= 550/250 = 2.2.
12. An oleo is used as shock absorber in an aircraft. Determine at which external diameter we should design oleo if load on the oleo is 100 pounds.
a) 0.4 unit
b) 0.9 unit
c) 2.9 unit
d) 3.4 unit
a
= 0.04*(100)0.5
= 0.4 unit.
13. If an aircraft has gear load factor of 3 and average total load during deflection is 180 unit then, find how much weight is carried during landing.
a) 60 unit
b) 10 unit
c) 100 unit
d) 283 unit
a
= 180/3 = 60 unit.
14. If piston diameter of an oleo system is given by 20 unit then, find the approximate value of typical external diameter of the same oleo system.
a) 26 unit
b) 10 unit
c) 50 unit
d) 200 unit
a
D = piston diameter + 0.3* piston diameter
= 20 + 0.3*20 = 26 unit.
15. Stroke depends on ___________
a) vertical velocity at touchdown
b) vertical velocity at climb
c) rate of climb
d) lift by wing at cruise
a
