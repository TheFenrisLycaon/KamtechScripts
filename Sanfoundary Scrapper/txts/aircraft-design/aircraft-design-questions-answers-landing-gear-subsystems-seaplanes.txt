1. What is seaplane?
a) Plane which can land and takeoff from the water
b) Plane which can only land on water
c) Plane which can only took off from water
d) Seaplane is always same as any other plane in terms of landing and takeoff location
a
2. If a seaplane needs to be designed then, which of the following could be considered as an application of the seaplane?
a) Search and rescue mission
b) Can be operated for every wave size in sea
c) Low value of wing loading
d) Ratio of weight to reference area is minimum among the other types of aircraft
a
3. Following diagram represents __________
a) typical seaplane geometry
b) schematic diagram of F16
c) mig29 design
d) typical aerostats
a
4. The hull of seaplane is based on the planning-hull concept.
a) True
b) False
a
5. Which of the following is correct?
a) Typically, bottom of the seaplane is fairly flat
b) Lift is same as weight always
c) Drag polar will show thrust vs weight
d) Seaplanes cannot land on water
a
6. Most of the sea plane is designed with _________
a) v shaped bottom
b) h bottom
c) v shaped bottom only
d) flat bottom only
a
7. For higher landing speed, deadrise angle should be __________
a) higher
b) lower
c) lowest
d) independent of speed
a
8. If a seaplane has velocity at stall as V mph then, what will be the value of deadrise angle?
a) ɑdeadrise = 0.5*(v – 20) degree
b) ɑdeadrise = 0.5*(v / 20) degree
c) ɑdeadrise = 0.5*v degree
d) ɑdeadrise = 0.5*(v2 – 20) degree
a
9. Let’s consider we want to design a seaplane which has the deadrise angle of 10° then, what should be the stall speed in in miles per hour?
a) 40mph
b) 89mph
c) 10mph
d) 21.9mph
a
Now, stall speed can be given by,
V = 2 * ɑdeadrise + 20 = 2*10 + 20 = 40mph.
10. A seaplane has beam of 5 unit then, estimate the step size required for given seaplane.
a) 0.25 unit
b) 9 unit
c) 1.2 unit
d) 4.6 unit
a
11. Typically, seaplanes can be categorized as ______________
a) floatplanes, flying boat, etc
b) floatplanes only
c) flying boat only
d) aerostats only
a
12. None of the seaplanes can ever land on airfields.
a) True
b) False
a
13. Which of the following is an example of seaplane?
a) Curtiss NC
b) A321 neo
c) Voodoo
d) Cessna 172
a
