10. A wing alone arrangement has wing lift curve slope of 2.65 per rad. Find slope of pitching moment coefficient. Given Xcg = 0.3.
a) 0.025 per degree
b) 0.03 per rad
c) 45 per rad
d) 0.0035 per degree
a
Slope of pitching moment curve = (wing lift curve slope*[Xcg-Xac])
= (2.56[0.3-0.25])
= 0.1325 per rad = 0.00253 per degree.
11. If moment coefficient about aerodynamic centre of wing is -0.216 and lift coefficient of wing is 1.2. Find moment coefficient about cg. Given cg location as Xcg = 0.3.
a) -0.156
b) 0.123
c) 0.56
d) -1.56
a
= -0.216 + (1.2[0.3-0.25]) = -0.156.
12. If CLɑ wing = 1.2 per rad then, determine CMɑ. Given Xcg=0.29.
a) 0.076 per rad
b) 45 per rad
c) 0.09 per rad
d) 1.45 per rad
a
13. A wing alone aircraft has aerodynamic centre pitching moment coefficient of -0.126. If lift coefficient at zero AOA is 0.38 then, find Cm0. Consider Xcg=0.3.
a) -0.107
b) -7.89
c) 1.457
d) 0.9845
a
Now, Cm0 is given by,
Cm0 = CMac + CL0*[Xcg-Xac]
= -0.126 + 0.38*[0.3-0.25] = -1.07.
14. An aircraft with wing aft tail configuration has tail efficiency of 0.95 and tail volume ratio of horizontal tail is 0.7. Determine pitching moment coefficient slope for the tail. Given lift curve slope of tail is 4.2 per rad. Consider downwash derivative as 0.6.
a) -1.1172 per rad
b) 2.45
c) 234.67 per degree
d) 12.788
a
Pitching moment coefficient slope for the tail = -e*v*c*(1-d)
= -0.95*0.7*4.2*(1-0.6) = -1.1172 per rad.
15. Find tail efficiency if, dynamic pressure at tail and wing is 25Pa and 28Pa respectively.
a) 0.892
b) 67.89%
c) 12.54
d) 0.067
