1. Mass flow rate will be affected by __________
a) altitude
b) weight of the aileron
c) induced drag only
d) longerons weight
a
2. A piston engine has bhp of 600 at sea level. Now, if engine is operating at an altitude where density ratio is 0.816 then, find the value bhp at that altitude.
a) 37
b) 89
c) 100
d) 289
a
Now, bhp at an altitude = p1*(d – ((1-d)/7.55))
= 600*(0.814-((1-0.814)/7.55))
= 600*(0.814-(0.1836/7.55)
= 600*0.0616 = 37.
3. Supercharger is used to improve __________
a) intake manifold pressure
b) outlet pressure
c) to increase charging capacity of an electric charger
d) expansion of exhaust velocity
a
4. Following diagram represents ________
a) bhp variation with altitude
b) drag polar
c) lift curve
d) power required vs thrust required
a
5. If a propeller has speed of 600 rpm and diameter of 1.2m and velocity of 10m/s. Find advance ratio.
a) 0.83
b) 0.39
c) 0.289
d) 0.1
a
= 10*60 / (600*1.2) = 0.83.
6. If a propeller has bhp of 700 and diameter as 1.2 ft. and rotating with 20 rps then, determine power coefficient. Consider sea level density.
a) 15.8
b) 1.8
c) 30.2
d) 40
a
= 550*700 / (1.225*1.25*203) = 15.8.
7. Determine the required thrust coefficient to produce thrust of 1000N. Given diameter is 1.2m and n=22 rps.
a) 0.813
b) 0.1
c) 0.32
d) 0.489
a
8. What should be the value of speed power coefficient if velocity of propeller is 12 unit and power is 100 unit? Given rps is 25.
a) 1.372
b) 2.35
c) 8.97
d) 9.79
a
9. Determine the propeller efficiency if propeller velocity is 300ft/s and thrust of 1320 lb. Given bhp is 800.
a) 90%
b) 0.03%
c) 0.895%
d) 0.09%
a
10. Determine thrust of propeller if propeller efficiency is 85%. Propeller is assumed to be operated with 1200 bhp and 350ft/s of velocity.
a) 1602.85 lb
b) 12kN
c) 16789lb
d) 8902lb
a
11. If slip function of propeller is 0.075 and diameter is 20 ft. then, determine the velocity of propeller. Given n = 25 rps.
a) 37.5 ft/s
b) 40ft/min
c) 128ft
d) 300ft/s2
a
