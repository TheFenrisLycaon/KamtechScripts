1. Low wing loading increases __________
a) weight and cost of aircraft
b) weight only
c) lofting
d) drafting
a
2. For estimated value of the thrust loading, we got three different values of wing loading. As a designer typically which wing loading should be considered?
a) Lowest among all three
b) Highest among all three
c) Any value
d) Always take average
a
3. What should be the aspect ratio (AR) of the prop aircraft if it is designed to work with maximum loiter wing loading of 32, CD0 = 0.06, dynamic pressure of 20 unit and Oswald efficiency as 0.6.
a) 7.54
b) 8.54
c) 7.65
d) 9.65
a
q = 20unit, Oswald efficiency e=0.6.
Wing loading at maximum loiter is,
W/S = q*\(\sqrt{3*ᴨ*AR*e*CD0}\) 
32 = 20*\(\sqrt{3*ᴨ*AR*0.6*0.06}\) 
1.6= \(\sqrt{3*ᴨ*AR*0.6*0.06}\) 
Hence, by squaring the aspect ratio AR,
AR = 7.54
4. What should be the load factor if, lift coefficient is designed as 2.1 and aircraft is operating at dynamic pressure q as 20 Pa. Given W/s =12.
a) 3.5
b) 5.5
c) 3.25
d) 4.5
a
Now load factor n is given by, n = q*CL / (W/S) = 20*2.1/12 = 3.5.
5. A designer is designing an aircraft which has climb gradient of 1.5 and has drag of 20N. If it weighs 220kg then, determine thrust to weight ratio?
a) 0.097
b) 0.87
c) 20
d) 220
a
Now thrust to weight ratio in terms of G is given by,
T/W = (G+D)/W = (1.5+20)/220 = 0.097.
6. If climb gradient is G, then which of the following is correct?
a) T/W ≥ G + 2*\(\sqrt{\frac{CD0}{ᴨ*e*AR}}\) 
b) T/W ≥ G + 4*\(\sqrt{\frac{CD0}{ᴨ*e*AR}}\) 
c) T/W ≥ G – 2*\(\sqrt{\frac{CD0}{ᴨ*e*AR}}\) 
d) T/W ≥ G – 4*\(\sqrt{\frac{CD0}{ᴨ*e*AR}}\) 
a
7. For jet aircraft, thrust loading is greater than the climb gradient.
a) True
b) False
a
8. After estimating thrust and wing loading, we can proceed to the initial sizing.
a) True
b) False
a
9. An aircraft is to be designed to have max lift coefficient as 2.8 and at q=10Pa. If maximum load factor n=5 then, what will be the stall speed?
a) 1.80m/s
b) 1.80mph
c) 2.80mph
d) 2.80m/s
a
Since density is not given we will take as sea level.
Load factor n = q*CL/(W/S)
(W/S)/CL = q/n = 10/5 = 2.
Now, stall speed V is given by,
V = \(\sqrt{2*(\frac{W}{S})/(\rho*CL)}\) 
= \(\sqrt{2*2/1.225}\) = 1.80m/s.
10. An aircraft has lift to drag ratio during cruise as 2.5 and load factor as 1.2. Which value of thrust loading should be selected?
a) 0.48
b) 0.58
c) 0.38
d) 0.28
a
Now, n at cruise is given by, n = (T/W)*(L/D).
Hence, T/w is given as,
T/W = n / (L/D) = 1.2/2.5 = 0.48.
