1. The actual available thrust used in performance calculations is termed as __________
a) installed net propulsive force
b) lift to drag ratio
c) installed weight to reference area
d) gross lift and weight
a
2. Fudge factor is used to obtain ______________
a) manufacturer’s uninstalled engine thrust
b) thrust loading and wing loading
c) lofting
d) lift to drag ratio
a
3. What do you mean by installed engine thrust?
a) Actual thrust produced by an engine when installed
b) Actual thrust when not installed
c) Lifting property
d) Installed wing lift
a
4. Following diagram represents __________
a) installed thrust methodology
b) uninstalled lift
c) lift to drag ratio determination
d) aerodynamic efficiency methodology
a
5. The installed net propulsive force is defined as _________
a) installed engine thrust minus the drag due to inlet, nozzle and throttle dependent trim drag
b) uninstalled thrust plus drag due to inlet and nozzle
c) installed lift by drag
d) installer wing loading
a
6. A manufacturer’s uninstalled engine is required to operate at 1.8M. Find the reference pressure recovery based on military standard.
a) 94.45%
b) 12.56%
c) 45.97%
d) 100%
a
Reference pressure recovery = 1 – 0.075(M – 1)1.35
= 1 – 0.075(1.8 – 1)1.35 = 0.9445 = 94.45%.
7. Following diagram represents _________
a) inlet pressure recovery concept
b) lift curve
c) inlet geometry
d) drag polar
a
8. A subsonic flight has actual inlet pressure recovery of 0.975. Estimate the thrust loss by this subsonic engine.
a) 3.37%
b) 56%
c) 2.5%
d) 11.22%
a
Thrust loss can be approximated as follows,
% Thrust loss = C*(reference pressure recovery – actual inlet pressure recovery)*100
Since, C is not given we will consider it as 1.35. 1.35 is a typical value of C for subsonic aircraft.
Hence,
% Thrust loss = 1.35*(1-.975)*100 = 3.37%.
9. Engine manufacturer has provided the reference value of inlet pressure recovery as 0.94. If actual pressure recovery is found to be 0.91 then, find the thrust loss. Consider C of 1.25.
a) 0.0375
b) 0.123
c) 0.0865
d) 0.568
a
Now, thrust loss = C*(p-p1)
= 1.25*(0.94-0.91) = 0.0375.
10. A supersonic aircraft is designed to operate at 2.0M if thrust loss is required to be less than 2% then determine the reference value of inlet pressure recovery. Given ram recovery Correction factor C is 1.2.
a) 95%
b) 99
c) 102
d) 70
a
= 0.02/1.2 + 0.93
= 0.016+0.93 = 0.95 = 0.95*100% = 95%.
11. An engine has mass flow of 16 unit and bleed mass flow of 0.32 unit. Find the thrust loss due to the bleed air.
a) 4%
b) 6.98%
c) 100.78%
d) 21%
a
% Thrust loss = C*(bleed mass flow/engine mass flow)*100
= 2*(0.32/16)*100 = 4%.
12. If manufacturer’s thrust loss requirement is 3% and engine has mass flow of 20 unit then, determine how much bleed mass flow can be used?
a) 0.3 unit
b) 0.4 unit
c) 0.8 unit
d) 0.9835 unit
a
Bleed mass flow = Thrust loss*Engine mass flow / C = 0.03*20/2 = 0.3 unit.
13. Which of the following is correct?
a) Drag due to air spilled before entering into the inlet is called additive drag
b) Lift is always equal to drag
c) Thrust loading is same as wing loading
d) Drag and lift are always unity
a
14. Following diagram represents __________
a) typical inlet drag trends
b) reynolds number
c) drag polar
d) lift coefficient curve
a
15. Nozzle drag varies with _________
a) position of nozzle, flight conditions, etc
b) only nozzle flight conduit
c) only with nozzle type
d) only with nozzle pressure at combustion chamber
