b) armpit inlet
c) wing tip inlet
d) tail tip inlet
a
2. Following diagram represents ________________
a) armpit inlet
b) wingtip inlet
c) lift curve
d) tail section
a
3. Following diagram represents _______________
a) wing root inlet
b) armpit inlet
c) chin inlet
d) nose inlet
a
4. Following diagram represents _________________
a) typical Podded engine
b) buried engine
c) nose buried engine location
d) side buried engine location
a
5. Following diagram represents ______________
a) tail podded engine
b) wing root buried engine
c) wingtip podded engine
d) wingtip buried engine
a
6. Which of the following is not an inlet location?
a) Side inlet location of buried engine
b) Tail root location
c) Lofting
d) Chin buried engine
a
7. Find the diameter ratio of an engine which has mach number of 0.7. Consider isentropic flow.
a) 1.045
b) 2.045
c) 3.45
d) 5.64
a
Now, for Mach number 0.7 area ratio is 1.094.
Now, diameter ratio is given by,
Diameter ratio = (area ratio)0.5 = 1.0940.5 = 1.045.
8. Which of the following is an incorrect example for BL diverter?
a) Step diverter
b) Boundary layer bypass duct
c) Boundary layer suction
d) Flap
a
9. Which of the following is an example of boundary layer diverter?
a) Boundary layer bypass duct
b) Fuselage fineness ratio
c) Thrust loading
d) Power loading curve
a
10. Which of the following will use suction to divert the boundary layer?
a) Boundary layer suction
b) Step diverter
c) Thrust loading
d) Power loading curve
a
11. Typical fighter is designed to operate at high angle of attack. Estimate the range of required boundary layer diverter thickness if fuselage length in front of the inlet is 10 unit.
a) 0.1 unit to 0.3 unit
b) 0.01 unit to 0.09 unit
c) 0.8 unit
d) 2.34 to 3.24 unit
a
Typical boundary layer diverter thickness = 1% to 3% of length
= 1% of (10) to 3% of (10)
= 0.1 unit to 0.3 unit.
