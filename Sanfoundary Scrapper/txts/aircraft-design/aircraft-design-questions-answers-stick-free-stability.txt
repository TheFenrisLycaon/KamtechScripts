a) Uncambered wing lift curve is not same as that of the Cambered
b) Stick free and stick fixed are same
c) Lift is not always same as weight
d) Thrust required is not always same power
b
2. Which of the following is correct?
a) Elevator can float in stick free condition
b) Drag is always same as weight
c) Power loading is same as weight
d) Stability is same for every aircraft
a
3. Stick free stability permits ____________
a) elevator to float
b) elevator to be fixed
c) fixed rigid body
d) lift and drag ratio
a
4. Stick fixed and stick free are similar.
a) True
b) False
b
5. Which of the following is correct?
a) Aircraft static longitudinal stability will be dependent upon the arrangement of different components
b) Lift is always same as weight
c) Static stability is similar to dynamic stability
d) All the aircrafts are statistically stable
a
6. Stick force is function of ___________
a) hinge moment
b) lofting
c) fuel air ratio
d) pressure ratio of inlet
a
7. Which of the following is correct for hinge moment?
a) Hinge moment coefficient is function of tail angle of attack
b) Hinge moment is not dependent on the tail angle
c) Downwash is used to reduces angle of attack at tail
d) Lifting property of the airfoil is same as a sphere
a
8. Hinge moment coefficient depends upon ________
a) Tail AOA, elevator deflection, etc
b) Only tail angle
c) Only wing angle
d) Lift to drag ratio of fuselage
a
9. Negative stick force gradient is used to provide ___________
a) speed stability
b) thrust
c) propulsive force
d) gliding ratio
a
10. Find the degree of elevator float. Consider tail AOA is 2° and CHδe= -0.005, CHɑt=-0.0052.
a) 2.08 deg
b) 4
c) 12
d) 2.119
a
Elevator float = -(CHɑt / CHδe)*ɑ = -(-0.0052/-0.005)*2 = -2.08°.
Considering only magnitude. Hence, 2.08°.
11. Determine the value of tail angle of attack if, elevator floats down by 1.8 degree. Consider CHδe as 0.003 and CHɑt as -0.006.
a) 0.9
b) 2.5
c) 3.4
d) 1.8
a
Now, tail angle of attack = – e* CHδe / CHɑt = -1.8*0.003/-0.006 = 0.9°.
12. Find the value of CHδe if tail angle of attack is 3 deg and CHɑt is -0.004. Consider elevator floats up by 2 degree.
a) -0.006
b) -7
c) 1.223
d) 1.225
a
Now, CHδe = – ɑ * CHɑt / e = -3*-0.004/-2 = -0.006.
13. Stick fixed neutral point is defined at 40% of chord. Choose appropriate location of Stick free neutral point.
a) 0.39
b) 0.8
c) 0.65
d) 0.5
a
Stick free neutral point = 2 to 5 % ahead of stick fixed = 0.02*0.4 to 0.05*0.4 ahead of stick fixed = 0.008 to 0.1 ahead of stick fixed neutral point
Hence, neutral point location of stick free = 0.4-(0.008 to 0.1) = 0.392 to 0.39.
Hence, Correct answer from the given options Will be 0.39.
