1. When we step on an upright soda can, it would fail due to __________
a) crippling
b) bending
c) torsion
d) shearing
a
2. A rectangular section has b of 2m and h of 5m. Find centroid coordinates.
a) (1, 2.5)
b) (3, 0)
c) (4, 2)
d) (2, 4.8)
a
= (2/2, 5/2) = (1, 2.5).
3. Find the radius of gyration if, moment of inertia I is 160 unit and 10 unit as area.
a) 4 unit
b) 5 unit
c) 2.3 unit
d) 5.6 unit
a
= \(\sqrt{\frac{160}{10}}\) = 4 unit.
4. Which of the following is correct?
a) Radius of gyration K = (I/A)0.5
b) Radius of gyration K = (I/A)0.8
c) Radius of gyration K = (I/A)*0.2
d) Radius of gyration K = (I/A)*0.8
a
5. The highest compression load which will not cause the elastic column buckling is called _________
a) euler load
b) bernoulli’s theorem
c) newtonian fluid
d) divergence
a
6. How do you define slenderness ratio?
a) Ratio of column’s effective length to c/s radius of gyration
b) Ratio of slender body width to the bluff body height
c) Ratio of lift to drag
d) Ratio of Thrust to weight
a
7. Column is supported by pin at both the ends and has length of 10 unit. If radius of gyration is 3.16 unit then find slenderness ratio.
a) 3.16
b) 2.13
c) 5.67
d) 0.56
a
Now, slenderness ratio = effective length/ radius of gyration = 10/3.16 = 3.16.
8. Column has length of 1.2 m and radius of gyration as 1.5m. Determine slenderness ratio. Consider column is fixed at one end free at other end.
a) 1.6
b) 7.8
c) 98
d) 12.45
a
Now, slenderness ratio = effective length / radius of gyration = 2.4/1.5 = 1.6.
9. If a column has slenderness ratio of 2.2 and 1.8 as the radius of gyration. Determine effective length of the column.
a) 3.96
b) 8.98
c) 4.5
d) 1.09
a
10. Determine the actual length of the column which has slenderness ratio of 2.9 and radius of gyration as 1.6. Consider column is fixed at both ends.
a) 9.28
b) 0.0045
c) 2.3674
d) 4.862
a
Actual length = slenderness ratio*radius of gyration/0.5 = 2.9*1.6/0.5 = 9.28.
11. A column has effective length as 20unit. Determine Euler load of EI = 1000 unit.
a) 24.67 unit
b) 10 unit
c) 40 unit
d) 50.99 unit
a
= \(\frac{\pi^2*1000}{20^2} \) = 24.67 unit.
12. Stress and pressure are same.
a) True
b) False
b
