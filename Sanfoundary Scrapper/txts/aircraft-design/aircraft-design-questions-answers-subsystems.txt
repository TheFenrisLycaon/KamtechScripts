b) more pressure output
c) deflect control surface
d) provide electrical power
a
4. Following diagram represents _____________
a) simplified hydraulic system
b) wing loading diagram
c) pneumatic subsystem
d) fuel tank location
a
5. Hydraulic system affect conceptual design based on __________
a) hydraulic pump space requirements
b) space for control surface
c) secondary control surface
d) lift required at tail
a
6. A typical electrical system may include _________
a) generators, transformers, cables, etc

8. Let’s consider we need to design avionics system for general aviation aircraft. If empty weight of aircraft is 100 unit then what will be the approximate range of required avionics weight.
a) 1 unit to 3 unit
b) 0.3 to 0.5 units
c) 0.58 units
d) 4 to 5 units
a
Typically, range of avionics weight can be estimated as follows.
Avionics weight range = 0.01*W to 0.03*W
= 0.01*100 to 0.03*100 = 1 unit – 3 unit.
9. Avionics stands for __________

b) airfare electrons
c) aviation electrical
d) prop aircraft
a
10. APU exhaust should be directed upward.
a) True
b) False
a
