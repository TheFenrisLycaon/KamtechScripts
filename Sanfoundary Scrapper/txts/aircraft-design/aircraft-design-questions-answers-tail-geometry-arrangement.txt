1. Typically tail provides ______
a) stability
b) control
c) stability and control
d) accelerating force
c
2. Which tail profile is shown in below diagram?
a) Cruciform tail
b) T – tail
c) H – tail
d) Conventional tail
a
3. Horizontal stabilizer is away from wing wake in T-tail configuration.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Why dorsal fins are used?
a) To improve tail-effectiveness at high slide slip angle
b) To reduce tail-effectiveness at high slide slip angle
c) Similar to horizontal tail
d) Provides lift to fly
a
5. Which control surface is primarily used for spin recovery?
a) Rudder
b) Elevator
c) Aileron
d) Flap
a
6. Elevator provides control for ______
a) pitching moment
b) yawing
c) roll
d) yaw-roll
a
7. Glider with span of 2m is flying at 10000ft. If aspect ratio of tail is 10 then, determine reference area of the tail.
a) 0.4m2
b) 0.4
c) 0.8
d) 0.8m2
a
10 = 2*2 / area
Area = 4/10 = 0.4m2.
8. Which of the following is correct?
a) Tail sweep is generally more than wing sweep
b) Tail sweep is generally same as wing sweep
c) Tail sweep is always ten times of wing sweep
d) Tail sweep is generally less than wing sweep
a
9. Typically, high speed aircrafts have thinner tail as compared to wing thickness.
a) True
b) False
a
10. Which of the following is not part of tail?
a) Aileron
b) Rudder
c) Elevator
d) Horizontal stabilizer
a
11. The inverted V-tail is used to ______
a) to reduce adverse yaw-roll
b) to provide adverse yaw-roll
c) to increase lift
d) to increase thrust
a
12. Determine the corrections or otherwise of the following assertion [A] and reason [R]:
Assertion [A]: Most of the tails are using symmetric airfoils.
Reason[R]: Tail control has two primary control surface.
a) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A] 
b) Both [A] and [R] are true but [R] is not the correct reason for [A] 
c) [A] is true but [R] is false
d) [A] is false but [R] is true
b
13. What is the use of V type tail?
a) To reduce wetted area
b) To increase wetted area
c) To prevent adverse yaw roll
d) To produce thrust
a
