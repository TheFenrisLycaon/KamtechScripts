c) will not change
d) lofting is changed
a
6. Power loading of prop driven aircraft is ______

c) always be zero
d) equal to drag always
a
7. Power loading of a prop driven aircraft is defined as _________
a) weight of aircraft to the horsepower by prop engine
b) weight of aircraft into the horsepower by prop engine
c) horsepower by prop engine
d) weight of aircraft
a
8. Determine the corrections or otherwise of the following assertion [A] and reason [R]:
Assertion [A]: Aerobatic prop aircraft has much higher power loading.
Reason[R]: Power loading of prop aircraft is ratio of power to the weight of the aircraft.
a) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A] 
b) Both [A] and [R] are true but [R] is not the correct reason for [A] 
c) Both [A] and [R] are false
d) [A] is false but [R] is true
c
9. Which of the following is correct for horsepower (hp) to the weight ratio?
a) T/W = (550*η / V) * (hp/W)
b) T/W = (550*η / V)
c) T/W = (550*η / V) + (hp/W)
d) T/W = (550*η / V) – (hp/W)
a
In general, for prop aircraft thrust loading and power loading is given as,
T/W = (550*η / V)*(hp/W)
10. Typically, designer designs thrust loading based on ________
a) static sea-level conditions, take-off requirement etc
b) only Lift
c) only static sea-level conditions
d) only landing conditions
a
11. A jet fighter aircraft is flying with maximum Mach number of 2.0. What will be the thrust loading of the fighter?
a) 0.57
b) 0.64
c) 2.5
d) 2.0
a
Now for jet fighter thrust loading is given by,
T/W0 = a*Mc
For a jet fighter a=0.514, c=0.141
Hence, T/W0 = 0.514*2.00.141 = 0.566 = 0.57.
12. If thrust loading is 0.65 then, find the power loading of a prop aircraft. Consider propeller is idle.
a) 846.15/V
b) 846.15
c) 650
d) 6.5
a
Since propeller is idle, propeller efficiency ƞ=1. Here, velocity is not mentioned so we will substitute it as V.
Now, thrust loading is given as,
T.L. = T/W = (550*η / V)*(hp/W)
Hence, power loading W/hp = PL = 550*η / (T.L.*V) = 550/(V*0.65) = 846.15/V.
13. If a turboprop is cruising with 2275kg of weight, then determine power loading. Given power = 190hp.
a) 12
b) 5
c) 10
d) 25
a
Hence, power loading = W/hp = 2275/190 = 11.97 = 12.
14. An aircraft is cruising with lift coefficient of 2.5 and thrust loading of 0.6. Find drag coefficient of the aircraft.
a) 1.5
b) 2.5
c) 2.6
d) 2.59
a
Now, thrust loading at cruise is given by,
T/W = CD / CL
0.6 = CD / 2.5
CD = 0.6*2.5 = 1.5.
15. Following graph represents _____
a) thrust lapse at cruise
b) power lapse at cruise
c) temperature lapse rate
d) temperature variation
a
