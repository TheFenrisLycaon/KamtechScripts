1. Wing and airfoil both are 3D phenomena.
a) True
b) False
b
2. A 3D airfoil is called _____________
a) wing
b) airfoil
c) engine
d) lofting
a
3. If taper ratio is T and span is b with surface area as S then the root chord is _____
a) Croot = 2*S / (b*(1+T))
b) Croot = 2*S / (b*(3+T))
c) Croot = 2*S / (2b*(1+T))
d) Croot = 2*S / (1+T)
a
Croot = 2*S / (b*(1+T)). The value of root chord will be different for different aircrafts.
4. A wing has root chord of 2m and taper ratio of 0.5. Determine what will be the value of tip chord?
a) 1m
b) 1.5m
c) 1
d) 1.5
a
Taper ratio T = 0.5
Now, taper ratio T = tip chord / root chord
Tip chord = T*root chord = 0.5*2 = 1m.
5. Wing planform is affected by _____
a) sweep only
b) aspect ratio, sweep angle, taper ratio
c) aspect ratio only
d) taper ratio only
b

6. Wing aspect ratio is defined as _____
a) span square divided by reference area
b) span square multiplied by reference area
c) span square plus reference area
d) span square
a
7. A typical wing has aspect ratio of 7 and span of 2m. If taper ratio T = 0.2 then, find the value of root chord.
a) 0.4761m
b) 0.61m
c) 0.81m
d) 0.71cm
a
The root chord is given by,
Croot = 2*S / (b*(1+T))
Here, S is not given but aspect ratio is given.
Aspect ratio AR = Span square / S = 2*2 / S
7 = 4/ S
S = 0.5714 m2
Hence, Croot = 2*S / (b*(1+T))
= 2*0.5714 / (2*(1+0.2)) = 0.4761m.
8. If a sailplane is to be designed then, the aspect ratio of the sailplane will be ______
a) higher than military aircraft
b) same as military aircraft
c) lower than military aircraft
d) exactly half of the military aircraft
a
9. A jet fighter is operating at Mach number of 1.4. Wing chord is 1m then, find the location of aerodynamic centre.
a) 0.4m
b) 0.4
c) 0.8m
d) 0.8
a
For such high speed aircraft, location of the aerodynamic center is given by,
Location of aerodynamic center = 40% of chord = 40% of 1 = 0.4*1 = 0.4m.
10. Which of the following is correct?
a) Weight will be more for higher aspect ratio wing
b) Military aircraft have much higher aspect ratio
c) Civil aircraft are flying at hypersonic speed
d) Lofting is a conceptual design of wing
a
11. Which type of wing planform is shown below?
a) Tapered wing
b) Elliptic wing
c) Rectangular wing
d) Delta wing
a
12. Determine the corrections or otherwise of the following assertion [A] and reason [R]:
Assertion [A]: Taper ratio will affect the weight of wing.
Reason[R]: For finite taper ratio, wing thickness will be different at root and tip.
a) Both [A] and [R] are true and [R] is the correct reason for [A] 
b) Both [A] and [R] are true but [R] is not the correct reason for [A] 
c) [A] is true but [R] is false
d) [A] is false but [R] is true
a
13. A twin turboprop engine is flying with 120m/s. Wing of the aircraft has span of 2m and lift co-efficient as 0.15 with aspect ratio as 9.2. Find the lift produced by the wing.
a) 574.18 N
b) 574.18
c) 120 N
d) 620 N
a
Velocity V = 120m/s, CL = 0.15, Aspect ratio = 9.2, span b=2m
Aspect ratio = b*b/S
9.2 = 2*2/s
S = 0.434m2
Now, lift is given by,
L = (1/2)*ρ*V2*S*CL = 0.5* 1.225*120*120*0.434*0.15 = 574.18N.
