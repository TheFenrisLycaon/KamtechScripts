6. Consider equivalent skin friction coefficient as 0.0025 and Swet/Sref = 0.6. Evaluate parasite drag.
a) 0.0015
b) 02.34
c) 1.23
d) 0.000025
a
= 0.0025*0.6 = 0.0015.
7. Find the approximate value of wetted area Swet for given reference area of Sref=20 unit and parasite drag coefficient of 0.0028. Consider equivalent skin friction coefficient Cf as 0.003.
a) 18.67 unit
b) 12 unit
c) 20 unit
d) 65 unit
a
= 0.0028*20/0.003 = 18.67 unit.

a) 35.725
b) 12
c) 100
d) 423.2
a
= 1 + (60/1.23) + (1.2/400)
