1. What do you mean by rate of climb?
a) Vertical velocity of an aircraft
b) Lift of an aircraft
c) Thrust required
d) Drag polar
a
2. Ratio of vertical distance travelled to the horizontal distance travelled is known as __________
a) climb gradient
b) lift curve slope
c) power required
d) thrust loss
a
3. Which of the following is correct in terms of fate of climb (R/C)?
a) R/C = excess power/weight
b) R/C = lift/drag
c) R/C = excess lift/drag
d) R/C = excess power/Thrust required
a
4. Consider the vertical velocity of the aircraft is 10m/s and horizontal velocity is 12 m/s. Determine the value of climb gradient.
a) 0.833
b) 1.89
c) 8
d) 2.483
a
5. Find lift to weight ratio if climb angle is 45°.
a) 0.707
b) 1
c) 1.34
d) 0.992
a
6. Determine the value of climb angle if, excess thrust is 40 unit and weight of the aircraft is 60 unit. Consider steady climb.
a) 41.8
b) 50
c) 78
d) 12
a
7. Find the approximate value of climb angle if Thrust is 1500N, drag is 1000N and weight of the aircraft is 2500N.
a) 11.53 degree
b) 30 degree
c) 40 degree
d) 1 degree
a
Climb angle = arcsine [{T-D}/W]
= arcsine [{1500-1000}/2500] = 11.53 degree.
8. Determine the value of fuel burned during steady climb if SFC C is 0.000029 per second, thrust is 150KN and time required is 1500s.
a) 6.525 KN
b) 100N
c) 345
d) 87.87 N
a
= 0.000029*150*1500*1000 = 6.525KN.
9. Find the approximate value of velocity of best climb. Consider Thrust loading as 1.08, wing loading as 377 unit, CD0 as 0.025, K as 0.0075 and sea level density as 1.225 unit.
a) 98.46
b) 37.45
c) 12.1
d) 189.982
a
Velocity of best climb = \(\sqrt{\frac{w*[T+\sqrt{T^2+12CD0*K}]}{3*d*CD0}}\) 
= \(\sqrt{\frac{377*[1.08+\sqrt{1.08^2+12*0.025*0.0075}]}{3*1.225*0.025}}\) 
= \(\sqrt{4488.09*2.16}\) = 98.46 unit.
10. Which of the following is correct value for rate of climb if an aircraft has free stream velocity of 125 m/s? Consider steady climb at climb angle of 10°.
a) 21.70 m/s
b) 12 m
c) 35 m/min
d) 1.302 min/m
a
11. To operate at R/C of 7.08 m/s, determine the value of excess power. Consider weight of the aircraft as 13127.5 N.
a) 92.942 kW
b) 1000W
c) 13127 N
d) 1.312KN
a
12. Consider steady climb from an altitude of 10km to 15km. If rate of climb is 20 m/s then, determine the time to climb.
a) 250s
b) 25 min
c) 4.16 hr
d) 0.07 min
