b
2. There are ___________ fuel flow laws.
a) one
b) two
c) three
d) four
c
i. C=C1, here specific fuel consumption is constant
ii. C=C2θ1/2Mn , here it considers temperature and effects of mach number
iii. C=C3+C4M and C=C5+C6FN, here the assumptions are taken for empirical fuel flow data.
3. What is the significance of first fuel flow law?
a) Specific fuel consumption is not considered
b) Considers temperature and effects of mach number
c) Assumptions are taken for empirical fuel flow data
d) Specific fuel consumption is constant
d
4. What is the significance of second fuel flow law?
a) specific fuel consumption is not considered
b) considers temperature and effects of mach number
c) assumptions are taken for empirical fuel flow data
d) specific fuel consumption is constant
b
5. What is the significance of third fuel flow law?
a) Specific fuel consumption is not considered
b) Considers temperature and effects of mach number
c) Assumptions are taken for empirical fuel flow data
d) Specific fuel consumption is constant
c
6. The second fuel flow law is used in the turbojet or turbofan.
a) True
b) False
a
7. What is meant by fuel ratio?
a) ratio of initial fuel of aircraft to that of final weight of aircraft
b) ratio of final fuel of aircraft to that of initial weight of aircraft
c) ratio of initial weight of aircraft to that of final weight of aircraft
d) ratio of final weight of aircraft to that of initial weight of aircraft
c
8. Which of the following is the correct equation?
a) SAR=\(\frac{C}{V}\frac{L}{D}\frac{1}{W}\) 
b) SE=\(\frac{C}{V}\frac{L}{D}\frac{1}{W}\) 
c) SAR=\(\frac{V}{C}\frac{L}{D}\frac{1}{W}\) 
d) SAR=\(\frac{1}{C}\frac{L}{D}\frac{1}{W}\) 
c
9. There are two fuel flow laws. They are:
i.	C=C1, here specific fuel consumption is constant
ii.	 C=C3+C4M, here it considers temperature and effects of mach number
a) True
b) False
b
i.	C=C1, here specific fuel consumption is constant
ii.	C=C2θ1/2Mn , here it considers temperature and effects of mach number
iii.	C=C3+C4M and C=C5+C6FN, here the assumptions are taken for empirical fuel flow data.
10. What is the fuel ratio of aircraft when initial and final weight are 385560kg and 15560kg?
a) 34.78
b) 24.78
c) 56.76
d) 45.65
b
On substituting the values ω=\(\frac{385560}{15560}\) 
ω=24.78.
