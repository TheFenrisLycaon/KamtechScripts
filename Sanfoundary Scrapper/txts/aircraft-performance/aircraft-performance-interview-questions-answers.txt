1. Factors that affect the aircraft performance during take-off are mass of the aircraft during take-off, air density, temperature and runway conditions.
a) True
b) False
a
2. MTOW stands for _________
a) Maximum permissible Take-Off Weight
b) Minimum permissible Take-Off Weight
c) Maximal permissible Take-Off Weight
d) Minimal permissible Take-Off Weight
a
3. The basic requirements for safe flight are that the space required for the aircraft to maneuver should never exceed the space available.
a) True
b) False
a
4. What is operational performance of an aircraft?
a) The performance of an aircraft which is related to the aircraft above ground level
b) The performance of an aircraft which is related to the aircraft engine
c) The performance of an aircraft which is related to the aircraft when it is on ground
d) The performance of an aircraft which is related to the aircraft taxing
a
5. Aircraft weight is the only controllable variable that can be used to ensure that space required for the maneuver doesn’t exceed the space available.
a) True
b) False
a
6. What is MTOW of an aircraft?
a) The maximum weight of an aircraft at which a pilot is allowed to attempt to land the aircraft
b) The maximum weight of an aircraft at which a pilot is allowed to attempt to take-off the aircraft
c) The minimum weight of an aircraft at which a pilot is allowed to attempt to take-off the aircraft
d) The minimum weight of an aircraft at which a pilot is allowed to attempt to land the aircraft
b
7. A flight is carrying 130 passengers over a distance of 990km with a seating capacity of 140 and a yield of 7.9. Calculate the load factor.
a) 90%
b) 92.86%
c) 89.556%
d) 67.35%
b
We know percentage load factor=\(\frac{no. \, of \, passengers \,travelling*distance \,travelled}{no. \,of \, seats*distance \, travelled}\) x 100%
On substituting the values,
Load factor=\(\frac{130*990}{140*990}\) x 100%
Load factor=92.86%.
8. A flight is carrying 130 passengers over a distance of 990km with a seating capacity of 140 and a yield of 7.9. Calculate the passenger revenue.
a) 143780
b) 1016730
c) 1094940
d) 1524263
b
On substituting the values
Revenue passenger kilometers=130*990
Revenue passenger kilometers=128700
On substituting revenue passenger kilometers in passenger revenue formula
Passenger revenue=128700*7.9.
9. A flight is carrying 130 passengers over a distance of 990km with a seating capacity of 140 and a yield of 7.9. Calculate the Revenue passenger kilometers.
a) 138600
b) 124570
c) 128700
d) 124560
c
On substituting the values
Revenue passenger kilometers=130*990
Revenue passenger kilometers=128700.
10. A flight is carrying 130 passengers over a distance of 990km with a seating capacity of 140 and a yield of 7.9. Calculate the available seats kilometer.
a) 148700
b) 138600
c) 128700
d) 154800
b
On substituting the values
Available seats kilometer=130*990
Available seats kilometer=128700.
