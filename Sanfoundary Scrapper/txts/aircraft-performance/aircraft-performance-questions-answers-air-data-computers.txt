6. Dynamic pressure is directly proportional to the flow speed.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Calculate the dynamic pressure of aircraft in air when mach number and pressure are 2 and 101325N/m2.
a) 283710 N/m2
b) 541278 N/m2
c) 352769 N/m2
d) 457815 N/m2
a
We get q=\(\frac{1}{2}\)*1.4*101325*22
On solving we get q=283710 N/m2.
8. Calculate the dynamic pressure of aircraft in air when density and flow speed are 1.23 kg/m3 and 340m/s.
a) 71094 N/m2
b) 54128N/m2
c) 65487 N/m2
d) 65789 N/m2
a
We get q=\(\frac{1}{2}\)*1.23*3402
On solving we get q=71094 N/m2.
9. Find the flow speed of air when the dynamic pressure is 70516 N/m2 and density is 1.23kg/m3.
a) 338.62 m/s
b) 340 m/s
c) 313.5 m/s
d) 321.5 m/s
a
On solving we get 70516=\(\frac{1}{2}\)*1.23*V2
V=338.62 m/s.
10. The Pitot-static system pressures are given to the air data computers to find CAS, density and temperature.
a) True
b) False
