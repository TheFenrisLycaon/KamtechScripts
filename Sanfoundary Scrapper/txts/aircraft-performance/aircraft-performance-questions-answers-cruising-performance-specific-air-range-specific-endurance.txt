1. In cruise performance the aircraft is considered to be steady, level, straight, symmetric flight with uniform acceleration.
a) True
b) False
b
2. What is a trim in aircraft performance?
a) The state of equilibrium where the forces and moments are balanced
b) The state of equilibrium where the forces and moments are not balanced
c) The state of equilibrium where only the forces are balanced
d) The state of equilibrium where only the moments are balanced
a
FN=D
L = W
Where FN is normal force acting on the aircraft, D is drag, L is lift and W is weight.
3. An aircraft is climbing with a 20° of climb angle and a 5° of angle of attack having a mass of 11,000 kg and aircraft drag is 9,000 N then determine engine thrust.
a) 5257.79 N
b) 1810.97 N
c) 28013.99 N
d) 46082.75 N
d
Engine thrust: From equating the horizontal forces we get the following equation: T cos α=D+Wsin γ
T=\(\frac{D+Wsin\gamma}{cos\alpha}\)=\(\frac{9000+107910*sin(20)}{cos(5)}\) 
T=46082.75 N.
4. An aircraft is climbing with a 20° of climb angle and a 5° of angle of attack having a mass of 11,000 kg and aircraft drag is 9,000 N then determine aircraft lift.
a) 11453.17 N
b) 9220.07 N
c) 11553.17 N
d) 97385.85 N
b
Engine thrust: From equating the forces we get the following equation: T cos α= D+W sin γ
T=\(\frac{D+Wsin\gamma}{cos\alpha}\)=\(\frac{9000+107910*sin(20)}{cos(5)}\) 
T=46082.75 N.
From equating the vertical forces we get the following equation: L+Tsinα=Wcosγ
L=107910*cos(20)–46082.75*sin(5)
L=97385.85 N.

5. An aircraft is climbing with a 20° of climb angle and a 5° of angle of attack having a mass of 11,000 kg and aircraft thrust is 46082.75N then determine aircraft drag.
a) 33898.64 N
b) 52708.59 N
c) 82814.78 N
d) 8999.99 N
d
Engine thrust: From equating the horizontal forces we get the following equation: Tcosα=D+Wsinγ
D=Tcosα-Wsinγ
D=46082.75*cos(5)–107910*sin(20)
D=8999.99 N.
6. What is specific air range?
a) horizontal distance flown per unit of fuel consumed
b) vertical distance flown per unit of fuel consumed
c) horizontal distance flown per unit time
d) vertical distance flown per unit time
a
7. What is specific endurance?
a) It is instantaneous flight distance per unit of time
b) It is instantaneous flight time per unit of distance
c) It is instantaneous flight distance per unit of fuel consumed
d) It is instantaneous flight time per unit of fuel consumed
d
8. In cruise performance the fuel mass flow determines the rate of change of mass of the aircraft.
a) True
b) False
a
9. What will be the specific endurance of an aircraft having fuel mass flow 0.75 kg/s?
a) 4.33 s/kg
b) 3.33 s/kg
c) 1.33 s/kg
d) 2.33 s/kg
c
On substituting we get SE=\(\frac{1}{0.75}\) 
SE=1.33s/kg.
10. What will be the specific endurance of an aircraft having fuel mass flow 0.75 kg/s and true air speed is 300m/s?
a) 400 m/kg
b) 333 m/kg
c) 133 m/kg
d) 250 m/kg
a
On substituting we get SAR=\(\frac{300}{0.75}\) 
SAR=400m/kg.
