1. The range factor is proportional to the square root of the initial cruising weight.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Which of the following is a correct statement?
a) Increase in initial weight of aircraft implies increase in fuel available for cruise
b) Decrease in initial weight of aircraft implies increase in fuel available for cruise
c) Increase in initial weight of aircraft implies decrease in fuel available for cruise
d) Increase in initial weight of aircraft does not have any effect on the fuel available for cruise
a
3. What happens if the final fuel weight increases in an aircraft?
a) Fuel ratio increases
b) Fuel ratio is not effected
c) Range of the aircraft is increased
d) Range of the aircraft is decreased
d
The fuel ratio decreases as fuel ratio is the ratio of the initial fuel weight to final fuel weight
The range of the aircraft flying will be reduced.
4. What is the relation between air temperature and the aircraft range?
a) Air temperature increases with increase in the aircraft range
b) Air temperature decreases with increase in the aircraft range
c) Air temperature increases with decrease in the aircraft range
d) Air temperature is not effected by the aircraft range
a
5. What is the relation between altitude and the aircraft range?
a) Altitude increases with increase in the aircraft range
b) Altitude decreases with increase in the aircraft range
c) Altitude increases with decrease in the aircraft range
d) Altitude is not effected by the aircraft range
a
6. The minimum drag speed in terms of equivalent airspeed is unaffected by the altitude.
a) True
b) False
a
7. The best range is obtained at 1.416 Vmd.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Which of the following factors are inversely proportional to the range of the aircraft?
a) Altitude
b) Ambient relative pressure
c) Temperature
d) Mach number
b
9. The range of the aircraft is increased if the aircraft is flown at a higher than optimum altitude.
a) True
b) False
b
10. Specific fuel consumption effects the range of an aircraft.
a) True
b) False
a
