1. Which of the following is the correct formula for lift of an aircraft?
a) L=\(\frac{1}{2}\)ρV2SCl
b) L=\(\frac{1}{2}\)V2SCl
c) L=\(\frac{1}{2}\)ρV2Cl
d) L=\(\frac{1}{2}\)PV2SCl
a
2. The zero-lift angle of attack is zero if the aerofoil is symmetric.
a) True
b) False
a
3. In the case of cambered airfoil the value of α0 is positive.
a) True
b) False
b
4. What is the theoretical value of lift curve slope of a flat airfoil?
a) 2π per radian
b) 4aπ per radian
c) 3π per radian
d) π per radian
a
5. The lift curve slope is inversely proportional to thickness and directly proportional to aspect ratio.
a) True
b) False
b
6. What is meant by stalling angle of attack?
a) The angle at which we get maximum lift
b) The angle at which we get maximum drag
c) The angle at which we get minimum lift
d) The angle at which we get minimum drag
a
7. Which of the following is a correct condition when the angle of attack is beyond stalling angle?
a) Drag is greater than lift
b) Weight is less than lift
c) Drag is less than lift
d) Weight is less than thrust
a
8. What is the value of Cl of a symmetric airfoil if the angle of attack is 5°?
a) 0.548
b) 0.0548
c) 3.1416
d) 31.416
a
Convert α into radians: α=5*\(\frac{\pi}{180}\) 
α=0.0873
Now substitute α in the above formula: Cl= 2π*0.0873
Cl=0.548.
9. What is stall buffet condition?

b) it is a condition in which the separation is laminar
c) It is a condition in which the flow separation is not considered
d) It is a condition in which the turbulence is not considered
a
10. Leading edge flap deflection has the effect of increasing lift curve to a higher stalling angle of attack.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Trailing edge deflection decreases the camber of the aerofoil section.
a) True
b) False
b
