1. The ratio of indicated temperature rise to ideal pressure rise is known as recovery factor.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Which of the following is the correct expression for recovery factor?
a) r=\(\frac{T_i+T}{T_t+T}\) 
b) r=\(\frac{T_i-T}{T_t-T}\) 
c) r=\(\frac{T_i+T}{T_t-T}\) 
d) r=\(\frac{T-T_i}{T+T_t}\) 
b
3. What is the recovery factor if the total temperature is equal to the indicated total temperature?
a) 1
b) 2
c) -1
d) -2
a
r=\(\frac{T_i-T}{T_i-T}\) 
r=1.
4. What is the relation between speed of object and temperature?
a) T0=T\(\Big[1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}(\frac{V}{a})^2\Big]\) 
b) T0=T\(\Big[1-\frac{\gamma-1}{2}(\frac{V}{a})^2\Big]\) 
c) T0=T\(\Big[1+\frac{\gamma+1}{2}(\frac{V}{a})^2\Big]\) 
d) T0=T\(\Big[1-\frac{\gamma+1}{2}(\frac{V}{a})^2\Big]\) 
a
5. What is the relation between recovery factor and temperature?
a) Ti=T[1+r\(\frac{\gamma-1}{2}\)M2] 
b) Ti=T[1+r\(\frac{\gamma+1}{2}\)M2] 
c) Ti=T[1-r\(\frac{\gamma-1}{2}\)M2] 
d) Ti=T[1-r\(\frac{\gamma+1}{2}\)M2] 
a
6. What is the indicated temperature of an aircraft having mach number 2 and when temperature and recovery factor are 300K and 2?
a) 780K
b) 128K
c) 345K
d) 435K
a
On substituting the values we get Ti=300[1+2\(\frac{1.4-1}{2}\)22] 
On solving above equation we get Ti=780K.
7. What is the mach number of the aircraft which is moving in air at an indicated total temperature is 780K and the temperature, recovery factor at that point are 300K and 2?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 0.1
d) 0.2
b
On substituting the values in the formula, we get 780=300[1+2\(\frac{1.4-1}{2}\)M2].
On solving we get M=2.
8. The difference in indicated values and local values of altitude, airspeed and mach number is known as system pressure error.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Calculate the indicated temperature rise when indicated total temperature is 400K and temperature at that point is 389K.
a) 11
b) 5.5
c) 6
d) 12
a
On substituting the values we get the indicated temperature rise=400-389
The indicated temperature rise=11.
10. Calculate the ideal temperature rise when total temperature is 440K and temperature at that point is 369K.
a) 71
b) 70
c) 75
d) 78
a
On substituting the values we get the indicated temperature rise=440-369
The indicated temperature rise=71.
