7. Find the geopotential height of an aircraft flying sea level where L0=-0.0065 k/m, p=30070.36Pa.
a) 9120 km
b) 9144 km
c) 9854 km
d) 9874 km
b
We know T0=288.15K, p0=101325Pa, R=287 J/kg-K, g0=9.81m/s2.
From H=\(\frac{T_0}{l_0}\)[\((\frac{p}{p_0})^\frac{-L_0R}{g_0}\)-1] 
H=\(\frac{288.15}{-0.0065}\)[\((\frac{30070.36}{101325})^\frac{-(-0.0065)*287}{9.81}\)-1] 
H=9144 km.

d) H=\(\frac{T_0}{l_0}\)[(\(\frac{p}{p_0}\))\(\frac{L_0R}{g_0}\)+1] 
c
H=geopotential height
R=characteristic gas constant
T0=temperature at 11km
P0=pressure at 11km
g0=acceleration due to gravity
p=pressure
L0=lapse rate.
