1. In a power supply, the output voltage can vary due to multiple reasons. Which of these is not true if it is found that the output voltage is constant?
a) The voltage stability factor is very high
b) The output resistance is zero
c) The temperature coefficient is zero
d) The voltage stability factor is very small
a
VO = f(VS, IL,T)
ΔVO = SV.ΔVS + ROΔIL + STΔT.
2. Consider the op-amp circuit shown.
The breakdown voltage of the Zener is 5V. β for the transistor is 100. R1=10kΩ, R2=90kΩ, R3=30kΩ, R4=50kΩ. Calculate the total output voltage.
a) 20V
b) 30V
c) 5V
d) 50V
a
VO = 20V.
3. Consider the following circuit. Find the power dissipation of the transistor given that the diode breakdown voltage is 5V, R1=20kΩ, R2=100kΩ, R3=200kΩ, R4=10Ω. The source voltage VS=20V.
a) 12.12W
b) 9.375W
c) 9.27W
d) 10.575W
b
VCE = VC – VE = VS – VOUT = 20-5(1+R2/R3) = 20-5×3/2 = 20-7.5 = 12.5V
IC ≈ IE = load current, since R2 and R3 are greater than the load, so most current flows through the load.
IL = VOUT/10 = 0.75A
P = 12.5 x 0.75 = 9.375W.
4. In the Zener controlled series regulator shown below, find the current through the Zener diode.
Given that the Zener diode breakdown voltage is 5V, the source voltage is 15V, the output voltage is 10V, R4 = 2kΩ, β=99, R1=2kΩ.
a) 5.05 mA
b) 4.95 mA
c) 3.33 mA
d) 0
b
IB = 10/100×2000 = 0.05 mA
Current through R1 = IB + IZ = I1
IZ = I1 -IB = 15-5/2k – 0.05 = 5 – 0.05 = 4.95mA.
5. Consider the circuit shown and find the percentage increase in power dissipation of the transistor if the source voltage increases by 10%.
Given that the breakdown voltage is 5V, R1=10kΩ, R2=100kΩ, R3=200kΩ, R4=10Ω. The source voltage VS=25V.
a) 10%
b) 20.22%
c) 14.28%
d) 15.66%
c
IC = 7.5/10 = 0.75A
VOUT and IC do not change, only VCE changes.
10% increase in VS means now VS = 110/100 * 25 = 27.5V
VCE = 20V
Power initially P1 = 17.5 x 0.75 = 13.125W
Power finally P2 = 20 * 0.75 = 15W
Power increase % = 15-13.125/13.125*100 = 14.28%.
6. The following is a shunt regulator. Find maximum power dissipation of the Zener diode and transistor, given that the source voltage varies from 20-40V, the Zener breakdown voltage is 5V, the output voltage is 10V, the resistance R1=50Ω, R2=20kΩ, β=99, VBE=0.5V.
a) PTransistor = 5.12 W, PZener = 0.051 W
b) PTransistor = 0.41 W, PZener = 0.57 W
c) PTransistor = 5.94 W, PZener = 0.057 W
d) PTransistor = 6.22 W, PZener = 5.66 W
c
Current across R1 = VS-VO/R1
For maximum power dissipation, supply is maximum
I = 40-10/50 = 0.6A
Current I = IZ + IC = IB + βIB = 100IB
IB = 6mA
IC = 0.594 A
PTransistor = 10*0.594 = 5.94 W
PZener = 10-0.5 * 6mA = 57mA = 0.057 W.

8. In a transistorized series regulator, how is the overload and short-circuit protection provided?

c) By using a diode and an additional resistor to protect the transistor
d) By using a diode along with a capacitor of a small capacitance value in series
