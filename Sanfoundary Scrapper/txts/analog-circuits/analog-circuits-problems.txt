1. Given the following circuit.

a) 612.8kΩ
b) 33kΩ
c) 220.22kΩ
d) 450.8kΩ
a
β = R1/R1+R2 = 30k/30k+R
Thus (30k/30k+R). 15 > 0.7
450k/30k + R > 0.7
30k+R < 642.85k
R < 612.8kΩ.
2. For the given circuit, find the time period of the output waveform, given that the diode is used is of Silicon and the supply voltage being applied is ±15V.  The feedback factor is 0.4.
a) 11.12 ms
b) 12.4 ms
c) 11.2 seconds
d) 5.6 ms
a
T = 10x2x10-3xln((1+0.7/15)/0.6) = 20×10-3ln(1.0467/0.6)=20×0.556×10-3
T = 11.12 ms.
3. Find the approximate frequency of output waveform of a monostable multivibrator given that RC = 20×10-3 and feedback factor = 0.3.
a) 200Hz
b) 142Hz
c) 233Hz
d) Can’t be found out without supply voltage value
b
T = 20×10-3 x ln(1/0.7) = 20×0.35×10-3 = 7ms
f = 0.142 kHz = 142 Hz.
4. Consider the circuit shown below.
R1=5kΩ, R2=5kΩ, R3=5kΩ, R4=10kΩ, R5=20kΩ, C1=10μF. Calculate the total charging time and discharging time.
a) The charging time = 0.2 seconds, the is charging time is 0.2 seconds
b) The charging time = 0.3 seconds, the discharging time is 0.2 seconds
c) The charging time = 0.3 seconds, the discharging time is 0.3 seconds
d) The charging time = 0.5 seconds, the discharging time is 0.4 seconds
b
Charging time = (R4+R5)C1 = 30x10x10-3 = 0.3 seconds.
5. For the given circuit, find the duty cycle of the output.
R4=30kΩ, R5=25kΩ.
a) 0.6875
b) 0.7211
c) 0.5681
d) 0.5010
a
Duty cycle = R4+R5/R4+2xR5
Duty cycle = 55/80= 0.6875.
6. What is the output frequency for the following circuit?
R4=30kΩ, R5=40kΩ, C1=5nF.
a) 2.63 kHz
b) 3kHz
c) 263 kHz
d) 4.4 kHz
a
fO = 1.45×1000000/110×5 = 2.63 kHz.
7. In the astable multivibrator using IC 555, it can be used as a voltage to frequency converter.
a) True
b) False
a
8. How can a monostable multivibrator using IC 555 be used as a PWM generator?
a) If a diode is connected across the resistor RA
b) If a modulating signal m(t) is applied at the control pin
c) If the control pin is always kept high
d) It cannot be used as a PWM generator ever
c
9. Given that the charging current of capacitor is constant in a monostable multivibrator using IC 555, then find the type of output waveform, type of capacitor voltage waveform and the time period of output.
a) The capacitor waveform is a ramp, the output waveform is sinusoidal, the time period is \(\frac{2.C.VCC}{3.I}\) 
b) The capacitor waveform is a ramp, the output waveform is a pulse, the time period is \(\frac{2.C.VCC}{3.I}\) 
c) The capacitor waveform is a ramp, the output waveform is a pulse, the time period is \(\frac{C.VCC}{3.I}\) 
d) The capacitor waveform is a ramp, the output waveform is a ramp, the time period is \(\frac{2.C.VCC}{3.I}\) 
b
Time period of ramp/pulse = TO = 2VCCxC/3I.
