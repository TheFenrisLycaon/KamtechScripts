1. Which of the following statements are true?

P: JFET is biased to operate it in active region
Q: MOSFET is biased to operate it in saturation region
a) Both P and Q are correct
b) P is correct and Q is incorrect
c) P is incorrect and Q is correct
d) Both P and Q are incorrect
c
2. In the given situation for n-channel JFET, we get drain-to-source current is 5mA. What is the current when VGS = – 6V?
a) 5 mA
b) 0.5A
c) 0.125 A
d) 0.5A
c
When VGS = 0, IDSS = IDS = 5mA
When VGS = -6V, IDS = 5mA(1 + 4)2
IDS = 5 x 25 = 125 mA.
3. Consider the following circuit. Given that VDD = 15V, VP = 2V, and IDS = 3mA, to bias the circuit properly, select the proper statement.
a) RD < 6kΩ
b) RD > 6kΩ
c) RD > 4kΩ
d) RD < 4kΩ
a
VDS = VDD – IDSRD
To bias properly VDS > |VP| – |VGS|
VDS > -3
15 – 3mA*RD > -3
-3mA*RD > -18
RD < 6kΩ.
4. Consider the circuit shown. VDS=3 V. If IDS=2mA, find VDD to bias circuit.
a) -30V
b) 30V
c) 33V
d) Any value of voltage less than 12 V
c
3 = VDD – 2(15)
3 = VDD – 30
VDD = 33 V.
5. To bias a e-MOSFET ___________
a) we can use either gate bias or a voltage divider bias circuit
b) we can use either gate bias or a self bias circuit
c) we can use either self bias or a voltage divider bias circuit
d) we can use any type of bias circuit
a
6. Consider the following circuit. Process transconductance parameter = 0.50 mA/V2, W/L=1, Threshold voltage = 3V, VDD = 20V. Find the operating point of circuit.
a) 20V, 25mA
b) 13V, 22mA
c) 12.72V, 23.61mA
d) 20V, 23.61mA
c
VGS = 20 x 35/55 = 12.72 V
IDS = 0.25 (9.72)2
IDS = 23.61 mA.
7. Given VDD = 25V, VP = -3V. When VGS = -3V, IDS = 10mA. Find the operating point of the circuit.
a) -3.83V, 0.766mA
b) -2.345V, 0.469mA
c) 3.83V, 0.469mA
d) 2.3V, 0.7mA
b
Also, in above circuit, VGS = -IDSRS = – IDSx5k
Thus, IDS = IDSS(1-VGS/VP)2
Solving we get, IDS = 0.766mA, 0.469mA
Thus we get VGS = -3.83V, -2.345V
However, VGS should lie between 0 and VP.
8. Consider the following circuit. IDSS = 2mA, VDD = 30V. Find R, given that VP = – 2V.
a) 10kΩ
b) 4kΩ
c) 2kΩ
d) 5kΩ
b
IDS = (VDD – 15)/50k = 0.3mA
VGS = VP[1 – \(\sqrt{\frac{I_{DS}}{D_{SS}}}\)] 
VGS = -2 x (1 – \(\sqrt{.15}\)) = – 1.22V
Thus, VGS + IDS x (R) = 0
R = 1.22/0.3mA = 4kΩ.
9. Which of the following statements are true?

A: In a self bias circuit, the current IDS is not stable.
B: Source capacitance, CS, parallel to RS, reduces stability.
a) Both statements are correct and B is the correct reasoning
b) Both statements are correct but B is not the correct reason for it
c) Statement A is correct while statement B is wrong
d) Both statements are incorrect
d
10. For a MOSFET, the pinch-off voltage is -3V. Gate to source voltage is 20V. W/L ratio is 5. Process transconductance parameter is 40μA/V2. Find drain to source current in saturation.
a) 0.10 mA
b) 0.05mA
c) – 0.05mA
d) – 50A
c
ISD = 20*5*(-20-3)2 = 52900μA = 0.05mA.
