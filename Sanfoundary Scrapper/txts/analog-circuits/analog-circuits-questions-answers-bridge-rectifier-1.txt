1. DC average current of a bridge full wave rectifier is _________
(Where Im is the maximum peak current of input)
a) 2Im/ᴨ
b) Im/ᴨ
c) Im/2ᴨ
d) 1.414Im/ᴨ
a
2. DC power output of bridge full wave rectifier is equal to _________
(Im is the peak current and RL is the load resistance)
a) (2Im2/ ᴨ2)RL
b) (4Im2/ ᴨ2)RL
c) (Im2/ ᴨ2)RL
d) (Im2/2 ᴨ2)RL
b
We know VDC for a bridge rectifier is 2Vm/ᴨ and IDC for a bridge rectifier is 2Im/ᴨ. We also know VDC = IDC/RL.
Hence output power is IDC2RL = (4Im2/ᴨ2)RL.
3. Ripple factor of bridge full wave rectifier is _________
a) 1.414
b) 1.212
c) 0.482
d) 1.321
c
4. If input frequency is 50Hz then ripple frequency of bridge full wave rectifier will be equal to _________
a) 200Hz
b) 50Hz
c) 45Hz
d) 100Hz
d
5. Transformer utilization factor of a bridge full wave rectifier is equal to _________
a) 0.62
b) 0.69
c) 0.81
d) 0.43
c
6. If peak voltage on a bridge full wave rectifier circuit is 5V and diode cut-in voltage is 0.7, then peak inverse voltage on diode will be _________
a) 4.3V
b) 5.7V
c) 10V
d) 5V
d
7. Efficiency of bridge full wave rectifier is _________
a) 81.2%
b) 50%
c) 40.6%
d) 45.3%
a
8. In an bridge full wave rectifier, the input sine wave is 40sin100 ᴨt. The average output voltage is ________
a) 22.73V
b) 16.93V
c) 25.47V
d) 33.23V
c
Therefore, Em=40
Hence output voltage is 2Em/ᴨ. That is 80/ᴨ.
9. Number of diodes used in a full wave bridge rectifier is ________
a) 1
b) 2
c) 4
d) 6
c
10. In a bridge full wave rectifier, the input sine wave is 250sin100 ᴨt. The output ripple frequency of rectifier will be ________
a) 50Hz
b) 200Hz
c) 100Hz
d) 25Hz
c
