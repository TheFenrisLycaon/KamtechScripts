1. Which of these are incorrect about Darlington amplifier?
a) It has a high input resistance
b) The output resistance is low
c) It has a unity voltage gain
d) It is a current buffer
d
2. Consider the circuit shown below where hfe=50.
Calculate the input resistance of the network.
a) 255 kΩ
b) 13 MΩ
c) 5 MΩ
d) 250 kΩ
b
RE1 = (1+hfe)5k = 255kΩ
Net input resistance, RI = (1+hfe)RE1=(1+hfe)25k = 13005k = 13MΩ.
3. Given the following circuit.
It is given that hfe=55, hie=1kΩ, hoe=25μΩ-1. Calculate the net current gain and the voltage gain of the network.
a) AI=192.6, Av=220
b) AI=1, AV=220
c) AI=192.6, AV=1
d) AI=192.6, AV=55
c
AI = [1+hfe/1+hoehfeRE]x[1+hfe].
AI = 51×51/(1+25x50x10x10-3) = 192.6.
4. In a Darlington pair, the overall β=15000.β1=100. Calculate the collector current for Q2 given base current for Q1 is 20 μA.
a) 300 mA
b) 298 mA
c) 2 mA
d) 200mA
b
IC = β.IB = 15000 x 20μ = 300 mA
IC1 = β1.IB = 100.20μ = 2mA
IC2 = 300 – 2 = 298mA.
5. Darlington amplifier is an emitter follower.
a) True
b) False
a
transistor. It also provides a large β as per requirements.
6. What is the need for bootstrap biasing?
a) To prevent a decrease in the gain of network
b) To prevent an increase in the input resistance due to the biasing network
c) To prevent a decrease in the input resistance due to the presence of multiple BJT amplifiers
d) To prevent a decrease in the input resistance due to the biasing network
b
7. Consider a Darlington amplifier. In the self bias network, the biasing resistances are 220kΩ and 400 kΩ. What can be the correct value of input resistance if hfe = 50 and emitter resistance = 10kΩ.
a) 141 kΩ
b) 15 MΩ
c) 20 MΩ
d) 200 kΩ
a
RI = (1+hfe)2RE = 26MΩ
RI’ = 26M||142k = 141.22 K.
8. What is a cascade amplifier?
a) A cascade of two CE amplifiers
b) A cascade of two CB amplifiers
c) A cascade of CE and CB amplifiers
d) A cascade of CB and CC amplifiers
c
It is used as a wide-band amplifier.
9. Consider the figure shown.
Given that gm1 = 30mΩ-1 and gm2 = 50mΩ-1, α1 = 1.1, α2 = 1.5 what is the transconductance of the entire network?
a) 80 mΩ-1
b) 75 mΩ-1
c) 33 mΩ-1
d) 55 mΩ-1
d
gm = α1gm2
gm = 1.1 gm2 = 55mΩ-1.
10. Find the transconductance of the network given below, provided that gm1 = 30mΩ-1. VT = 25mV, VBias > 4V.
a) 30mΩ-1
b) 10mΩ-1
c) 1mΩ-1
d) 20mΩ-1
a
11. In the given circuit, hfe = 50 and hie = 1000Ω, find overall input and output resistance.
a) RI=956Ω, RO=1.6 kΩ
b) RI=956 kΩ, RO=2 kΩ
c) RI=956 Ω, RO=2 kΩ
d) RI=900Ω, RO=10 kΩ
c
Input resistance = hie||50k||40k = 0.956 kΩ.
