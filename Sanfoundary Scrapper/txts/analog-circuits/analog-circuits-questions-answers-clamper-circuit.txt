1. Which of the following is not true regarding clamper?
a) A positive clamper adds a positive DC voltage
b) A clamper can also be called as a re-inserter
c) To reduce tilt, reduce the RC value
d) Negative clamper will clamp the positive peak of output to the reference voltage
c
2. What is A, B, C and D to design a voltage doubler in the given circuit?
a) A=B=Resistors, C=D=Diodes
b) A=D=Capacitors, B=C=Diodes
c) A=Capacitor, B=D=Diodes, C=Resistor

b
3. Consider the circuit provided.  Total discharge time = 0.5 ms. Consider the diode to be an ideal diode, for a square wave input of ± 10 V, what is the percentage tilt? (C = 1MF & R = 50k Ohms)
a) 10%
b) 1%
c) 0.1%
d) 1.1%
b
% Tilt = ΔVo/2Vm * 100
Idischarge = 2Vm/R = 2*10/50k = 0.4 mA
ΔVo = Tdischarge*Idischarge/C = 0.5ms*0.4mA/1MF = 0.2
% Tilt = (0.2/20) * 100 = 1 %.
4. Given input for the circuit is f = 1 KHz.
Diode cut-in voltage = 0.7 V
Output waveform:
For the given output, find V1 and discharge time?
a) 4.3 V, 1ms
b) 4V, 0.5ms
c) 4.3V, 0.5ms
d) 5.7V, 1ms
c
Thus, Vo = 5 V when Vin = 10 V. Vcut-in = 0.7 V
Then, Vo = Vin – (V1 + Vcut-in) = 10 – (V1 + 0.7) = 5
Therefore V1 = 4.3 V
Discharge time = To/2 ; To = 1/fo = 1/1000 = 1 ms; Discharge time = 0.5 ms.
5. In the given circuit, given that C=2MF and diode cut-in voltage, Vγ =0. Calculate the average output voltage.
a) 2V
b) 4V
c) -2V
d) -3V
c
Capacitor charges up to  37 – 3 = 34 V
Vout = Vin – Vc = 32 + 5 sinωt – 34 = -2 + 5sinωt
Average output voltage = – 2 V.
6. Considering a clamper circuit, where capacitance C, load R, the cut-in voltage of diode are unknown, which is the correct statement?
a) The DC level of the signal changes
b) The peak-to-peak value of signal changes
c) The shape of signal changes
d) The DC level shifts up
a
7. Tilt of output waveform for the circuit is 1%. Given that input is a square wave ± 10 V, f = 2 kHz, diode cut-in voltage = 0.7, what is the relation between C and R?
a) RC=20
b) RC=1/2
c) RC=2
d) RC=1/20
d
Tilt = 100 *ΔVo/2Vm = 100 *ΔVo/20 = 5 * ΔVo = 1
Thus ΔVo = 0.2 = Idischarge * Tdischarge/C
Idischarge/C = 0.2/Tdischarge = 0.2/0.5 ms = 400
RC = 2Vm/400 = 20/400 = 1/20.
8. If input diode is an ideal diode. Which output waveform across R is valid for values of V1 from +2 to + 4 volts?
a)  
b)  
c) 
d)  
b
Since the bias voltage starts from 2V, the output waveform cannot start from 0V. 
9. Choose the correct option for the relation between the two circuits.
a) Circuit (a) is a voltage doubler circuit, while Circuit (b) does not double the voltage
b) Both are similar and double the voltage to 2Vm
c) Circuit (a) is a doubler circuit with output +2Vm and Circuit (b) is a doubler with output -2Vm
d) Circuit (a) is a doubler circuit, while Circuit (b) is a clipper
c
10. Consider the circuit shown. The input is a square wave ± 15 V, for a silicon diode and an output voltage swing of 30 V. Choose the validity of the statement. If the value of resistance R = 10KΩ and capacitance C = 1MF.
a) True
b) False
a
