a) Forward current
b) Dynamic conductance
c) Doping concentration
d) Reverse resistance
d
CD = τg = \(\frac{τ}{r} = \frac{τI_F}{ηV_T}\) 
where τ = carrier life time, g = dynamic conductance, IF = forward current.
2. If the diffusion capacitance is directly proportional only to the lifetime of holes in N side then ________
a) The diode is a p+n junction diode
b) The diode is a pn+ junction diode
c) The diode is a p+n+ diode
d) The diode can have any type of pn junction
a
3. Diffusion capacitance is larger than transition capacitance.
a) True
b) False
c) Both are same
d) Depends on doping concentrations
b
4. In a diode, the change in voltage being applied across it is 2V. The change in minority carriers outside the depletion region is 1.2×10-8. Find diffusion capacitance.
a) 6 pF
b) 6 μF
c) 1.2 nF
d) 6nF
d
CD = \(\frac{1.2 x 10^{-8}}{2}\) 
CD = 6 nF.
5. The minority charge concentration can be represented as Q = V2 – 33V. If the voltage being applied is now 5V, find the diffusion capacitance.
a) 1μF
b) 0.1μF
c) 10μF
d) 0.9μF
b
CD = \(\frac{dQ}{dV}\) = V-10 = 1.024 x 10-7
CD = 0.1μF.
6. Consider two almost similar diodes, whose diffusion capacitances are C1 and C2, and doping concentrations of 1020 /cubic centimeter and 1016/cubic centimeter. Find \(\frac{C1}{C2}\).
a) 100
b) 0.01
c) 10000
d) 0.0001
b
\(\frac{C1}{C2} = \sqrt{\frac{10^{16}}{10^{20}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{10^4}} = \frac{1}{100}\) 
\(\frac{C1}{C2}\) = 0.01.
7. If the relative permittivity of a diode remains constant, its area is doubled and its doping concentration is quadrupled. What is its new diffusion capacitance, of originally it was CD?
a) 4CD
b) 2CD
c) 3CD
d) CD
a
CD‘ = \(\frac{ε2A}{W}\) ∝ 2A.2 2A.\(\sqrt{4Doping}\) = 4 CD
CD‘ = 4CD.
8. Consider a step graded diode, which has built in voltage 0.7V, and depletion width 2μm. Depletion width is W2 when a reverse bias voltage of 11.3 V is applied. Find W2?
a) 8.28μm
b) 8μm
c) 4.14 μm
d) 9.88 μm
a
W2 = 4.14*2 = 8.28μm.
