1. Which is not a difference between active and passive filter?
a) A passive filter does not use op-amp while an active filter uses an op-amp
b) A passive filter can’t use an inductor while an active filter can
c) A passive filter performs only filtering while an active filter amplifies too
d) A passive filter is used at audio frequency and an active at radio frequency
d
2. In a low pass filter as below, find the cut-off frequency for the following circuit.
Given that R1=20kΩ, R2=25kΩ, C1=10nF.
a) 640 kHz
b) 636 Hz
c) 5.5 kHz
d) 200 Hz
b
fC = 1000000/2π25×10 = 636 Hz.
3. Given that the maximum gain of a low pass filter using op-amp is 5.5 and the resistor R1 = 10kΩ, find the value of R2.
a) 220kΩ
b) 55kΩ
c) 50Ω
d) -55kΩ
b
Thus gain = -ZF/Z = -R2/R1
Amplitude = 5.5 = R2/R1 = R2/10k
R2 = 55kΩ.
4. When the input frequency is equal to the cutoff frequency, how much is the phase shift in the output?
a) 180°
b) -135°
c) -45°
d) 135°
d
Phase shift = 180-45 = 135°.
5. For the circuit, calculate the phase shift.
It is given that R1=20kΩ, C1=2nF, R2=22kΩ, and input signal is 2sin6π103t.
a) 233.04°
b) 230.32°
c) 333.04°
d) 129.67°
a
fc = 1/2πR1C1 = 1000000/2π20×2 = 3.978 kHz
Phase shift = 180 + tan-13.987/3 = 233.04°.
6. What is the frequency response of the filter shown below?
Given R1C1=R2C2.
a)  
b)  
c)  
d)  
b
7. Given the following circuit, find the maximum gain.
a) 1+R2/R1
b) –R3/R2
c) 1+R3/R2
d) 1+ R1.R3/2
c
Thus maximum gain is A = 1+R3/R2.
8. For a low pass filter of non-inverting type, the cutoff frequency is 2kHz and the input frequency is 4kHz. Find the phase shift in output.
a) 117°
b) -117°
c) 243°
d) -63°
d
9. A filter is provided of order 3, find the roll-off rate.
a) 6 dB/decade
b) 60 dB/octave
c) 60 dB/decade
d) 3 dB/decade
c
10. Consider the circuit below and find its cut-off frequency.
R1=10kΩ, R2=20kΩ, R3=30kΩ, C1=2nF, C2=4nF, R4=15kΩ.
a) 4.6 kHz
b) 6.2 kHz
c) 5.5 kHz
d) 4.2 kHz
a
fC = 4.6 kHz.
