b) 3.2mA
c) 2.5mA
d) 7mA
a
Equation for diode current
                            where I0 = reverse saturation current
			          η = ideality factor
			          VT = thermal voltage
			          V = applied voltage
Since in this question ideality factor is not mentioned it can be taken as one. Take VT as 0.026 which is the standard value.
Hence current through one diode is 10-9x(e0.4/0.026) = 4.8mA.
2. Find voltage VOUT if the reverse saturation current of the diode is  1.1×10-8A, the cut-in voltage of diode is 0.6V and assume the temperature as 25oC.
a) 0.235V
b) 0.3148V
c) 0.456V
d) 0.126V
b
                            where I0 = reverse saturation current
			          η = ideality factor
			          VT = thermal voltage
			          V = applied voltage
Since in this question ideality factor is not mentioned it can be taken as one. Take VT as its standard value 0.026V.
Voltage VD = ηVTln(I/IO + 1) = 1 x 0.0257ln (2 x 10-3/(1.1 x 10-9))+1) = 0.0257ln(1,818,182) = 0.3704 V.
3. The current Ix in the circuit is 1mA then find the voltage across diode D1. The resistance R1 is 1KΩ. Assume the reverse saturation current is 10-9A. Voltage across resistor in this condition was 0.4V. Take VT of diode as 0.026V.
a) 2.3mA
b) 3.2mA
c) 5.2mA
d) 4.6mA
c
Current through diode
where I0 = reverse saturation current
			          η = ideality factor
			          VT = thermal voltage
			          V = applied voltage
Since ideality factor is not given take it as one.
Current through diode I = 10-9 x (e0.4/0.026) = 4.8mA
Total current = 4.8mA+0.4mA = 5.2mA.
4. Find the current Ix if the voltage across the diode is 0.5V. The reverse saturation current of diode 10-11A, the cut-in voltage of diode is 0.6V. Assume that the temperature at which diode operates is 25°C. The resistance R1=2KΩ.
a) 3.97mA
b) 4.51mA
c) 2.45mA
d) 3.05mA
d
Current through diode
where I0 = reverse saturation current
			          η = ideality factor
			          VT = thermal voltage
			          V = applied voltage
Since ideality factor is not given take it as one.
Current through diode I = 10-11 x (e0.5/0.0257) = 2.8mA
Total current = 2.8mA + 0.25mA = 3.05mA.
5. If the current I is 2mA then find the temperature at which diode operates. The cut-in voltage of diode is 0.6V. The reverse saturation current of diode is 10-9A. Resistance R is 1.3KΩ.
a) 45.85°C
b) 50.47°C
c) 60.26°C
d) 56.89°C
a
 where I0 = reverse saturation current
			          η = ideality factor
			          VT = thermal voltage
			          V = applied voltage
Since in this question ideality factor is not mentioned it can be taken as one.
VD = 3-(2mAx1.3k) = 0.4V
VT = T/11600
Thus Temperature, T = 11600×0.0275 = 319 Kelvin = 45.85°C.
6. If the temperature increases 10°C, the ratio of final reverse saturation current to initial reverse saturation current is _______
a) 1
b) 2
c) 1.5
d) 3
b
Io2 = 2(∆T/10)Io1 Where ∆T is temperature change
Ratio will be 2(∆T/10) = 21 = 2.
7. The reverse saturation current of a diode at 25°C is 1.5 x 10-9A. What will be the reverse current at temperature 30°C?
a) 3 x 10-9A
b) 2 x 10-9A
c) 2.12 x 10-9A
d) 1.5 x 10-9A
c
Io2 = 2(∆T/10)Io1 Where ∆T is temperature change
Here ∆T = 5, Therefore, Io2 = 25/10 Io1 = 1.414 x 1.5 x 10-9A = 2.121 x 10-9A.
8. How much times reverse saturation current will increase if temperature increases 15oC?
a) 2.52
b) 4.62
c) 4.12
d) 2.82
d
Io2 = 2(∆T/10)Io1
Where ∆T is temperature change
Ratio is 215/10 = 2.82.
9. The input voltage V1 of the circuit the circuit is 2V and resistor has a resistance of 1KΩ. The cut-in voltage of the silicon diode is 0.7V and the reverse saturation current is 10-8A.

For silicon diode, cut-in voltage is 0.7V.
Hence IR1 = 2-0.7 = 1.3V
Drop across the resistor is 1.3V.
10. If V1 is 5V and resistance R1 is 5KΩ and the cut-in voltage of the diode is 0.7V, what will be the voltage Vout across the diode? Take reverse saturation current as 10-8A and operating temperature as 25°C.
