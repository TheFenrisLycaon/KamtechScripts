1. DC average current of a center taped full wave rectifier is _______________
(Where Im is the maximum peak current of input)
a) 2Im/ᴨ
b) Im/ᴨ
c) Im/2ᴨ
d) 1.414Im/ᴨ
a
2. DC power output of center tapped full wave rectifier is equal to ___________
(Im is the peak current and RL is the load resistance)
a) (2Im2/ᴨ2)RL
b) (Im2/2 ᴨ2)RL
c) (Im2/ᴨ2)RL
d) (4Im2/ᴨ2)RL
d
We know VDC for a center taped rectifier is 2Vm/ᴨ and IDC for a center tap rectifier is 2Im/ᴨ.
We also know VDC = IDC/RL.
Hence output power is (4Im2/ ᴨ2)RL.
3. Ripple factor of center tapped full wave rectifier is _____________
a) 1.414
b) 1.21
c) 1.3
d) 0.48
d
4. If input frequency is 50Hz then ripple frequency of center tapped full wave rectifier will be equal to _____________
a) 100Hz
b) 50Hz
c) 25Hz
d) 500Hz
a
5. Transformer utilization factor of a center tapped full wave rectifier is equal to ___________
a) 0.623
b) 0.678
c) 0.693
d) 0.625
c
6. If peak voltage on a center tapped full wave rectifier circuit is 5V and diode cut-in voltage is 0.7, then peak inverse voltage on diode will be ___________
a) 4.3 V
b) 10 V
c) 5.7 V
d) 9.3 V
b
7. Efficiency of center tapped full wave rectifier is ___________
a) 50%
b) 81.2%
c) 40.6%
d) 45.3%
b
8. In a center tapped full wave rectifier, the input sine wave is 20sin500 ᴨt. The average output voltage is __________
a) 12.73V
b) 6.93V
c) 11.62V
d) 3.23V
a
Therefore, Em=20
Hence output voltage is 2Em/ ᴨ. That is 40/ ᴨ.
9. In a center tapped full wave rectifier, the input sine wave is 200sin50 ᴨt. If load resistance is of 1k then average DC power output of half wave rectifier is __________
a) 12.56W
b) 16.20W
c) 4.02W
d) 8.04W
b
On comparing Em = 200
Power = 4Em2/ ᴨ2RL = 800/ ᴨ2x 1000 = 16.20W.
10. In a center tapped full wave rectifier, the input sine wave is 250sin100 ᴨt. The output ripple frequency of rectifier will be __________
a) 50Hz
b) 200Hz
c) 100Hz
d) 25Hz
c
Therefore, w = 100ᴨ that is, frequency f = w/2ᴨ = 50Hz
Since the output of center tapped full wave rectifier have double the frequency of input, output frequency is 100Hz.
