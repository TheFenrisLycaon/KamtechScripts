1. DC average current of a half wave rectifier output is ___________
(Where Im is the maximum peak current of input)
a) 2Im/ᴨ
b) Im/ᴨ
c) Im/2ᴨ
d) 1.414Im/ᴨ
b
Thus this is calculated by Area of graph of current/Perion.
IDC=1/2π∫idx between 0 to 2π.
This is equal to Im/ᴨ.
2. DC power output of half wave rectifier is equal to ____________
(Im is the peak current and RL is the load resistance)
a) (2Im2/ ᴨ2)RL
b) (Im2/2 ᴨ2)RL
c) (Im2/ ᴨ2)RL
d) (4Im2/ ᴨ2)RL
c
   = Im/ᴨ x Vm/ᴨ = VmIm/ ᴨ2
We know Vm = Im RL. Therefore, power = (Im2/ ᴨ2)RL.
3. Ripple factor of half wave rectifier is _________
a) 1.414
b) 1.21
c) 1.3
d) 0.48
b
in reducing the ripple voltage. It is calculated by taking ratio of RMS AC component of output voltage to DC component of output voltage.
r = √Irms2 – IDC2/IDC
For a half wave rectifier, it is 1.21.
4. If input frequency is 50Hz then ripple frequency of half wave rectifier will be equal to __________
a) 100Hz
b) 50Hz
c) 25Hz
d) 500Hz
b
5. Transformer utilization factor of a half wave rectifier is equal to __________
a) 0.267
b) 0.287
c) 0.297
d) 0.256
b
6. If peak voltage on a half wave rectifier circuit is 5V and diode cut-in voltage is 0.7, then peak inverse voltage on diode will be __________
a) 3.6V
b) 4.3V
c) 5V
d) 5.7V
c
7. Efficiency of half wave rectifier is __________
a) 50%
b) 81.2%
c) 40.6%
d) 45.3%
c
8. In a half wave rectifier, the input sine wave is 200sin100 ᴨt Volts. The average output voltage is __________
a) 57.456V
b) 60.548V
c) 75.235V
d) 63.661V
d
Therefore, Em=200
Hence output voltage is Em/ᴨ. That is 200/ᴨ = 63.6619V.
9. In a half wave rectifier, the input sine wave is 200sin200 ᴨt Volts. If load resistance is of 1k then the average DC power output of half wave rectifier is __________
a) 3.25W
b) 4.05W
c) 5.02W
d) 6.25W
b
On comparing Em = 200
Power = Em2/ ᴨ2RL = 200/ ᴨ2x 1000.
10. In a half wave rectifier, the input sine wave is 250sin100 ᴨt Volts. The output ripple frequency of rectifier will be __________
a) 100Hz
b) 200Hz
c) 50Hz
d) 25Hz
c
On comparing equation w = 100 ᴨ rad/s
We know w=2 ᴨ x frequency.
Therefore, frequency = 50 Hz.
Ripple frequency and input frequency are the same.
