b) Perfect conductor
c) Perfect insulator
d) Capacitor
b
2. In ideal diode model diode in reverse bias is considered as a ___________
a) Resistor
b) Perfect conductor
c) Perfect insulator
d) Capacitor
c
3. Voltage drop produced by a diode at forward bias in ideal diode model is equal to ___________
a) 0.7V
b) 0.3V
c) 1V
d) 0V
d
4. The current I through the circuit if we consider diode in ideal diode model.
a) 3mA
b) 3A
c) 1A
d) 0.4mA
a
I = (3V/1K) = 3mA.
5. The voltage VOUT across the ideal diode if VIN is-5V and resistance R1=10KΩ is ___________
a) -5V
b) 0V
c) -2.5V
d) 2.5V
a
6. The current I through the circuit I if voltage v = -3V is _______________
a) 0A
b) 3A
c) 1.5A
d) 6A
a
7. If current source I produces a current of 1mA and resistance R=3kΩ, then what is the voltage across the resistor given that diode is ideal?
a) 0V
b) 1V
c) 3V
d) 1.5V
a
Since current forward biases the diode it acts as a conductor so current through resistor is zero so voltage is zero. Therefore, voltage across resistor is zero.
8. If resistance R1 is 10KΩ, V2 = 2V, V1 = 3V and the diode is ideal, then the current I through the circuit will be ___________
a) 0.3mA
b) 0.6mA
c) 0.7mA
d) 0.1mA
d
Since the diode is in reverse bias, it can be considered open and no current flows through it. Then effective voltage becomes 3-2 = 1V so current is 1/10K = 0.1mA.
9. If resistance R1 is 10K, V2 = – 2V, V1 = 3V and the diode is ideal then the current I through the circuit will be _________
a) 0.2mA
b) 0A
c) 0.5mA
d) 0.3mA
d
The voltage V2 forward biases the diode so in effect V2 Vanishes. Also V1 is in reverse bias to the diode so it will not pass through diode. Therefore, effective current will be
(3V/10K) = 0.3mA.
10. What will be the voltage Vout if VA = 3V and VB = -5V and the diodes are ideal?
a) 5V
b) 3V
c) 2V
d) 0V
b
