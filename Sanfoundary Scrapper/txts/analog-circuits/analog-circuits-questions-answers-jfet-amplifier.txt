6. Consider the amplifier below.
Find the input resistance and voltage gain of the circuit, given gm = 0.5mΩ-1 and rds = 0.2MΩ.
a) RI = 27.27 kΩ, AV = 5
b) RI = 44 kΩ, AV = 1
c) RI = 27.27kΩ, AV = 1
d) RI = 60kΩ, AV = 100
c
Its input resistance, RI = RG = 60k||50k = 27.27 kΩ
The voltage gain is 1.
7. Which of these is incorrect for a common gate amplifier?
a) It is a current  buffer
b) It has ∞ output resistance
c) Its input resistance is high
d) It is used as a high-frequency amplifier
c
8. In a high-frequency model of a JFET, which of these capacitances is present?
A: Gate-to-source capacitance
B: Gate-to-drain capacitance
C: Drain-to-source capacitance
a) A and B
b) A and C
c) B and C
d) A, B and C
d
9. Which of these is false for a CS amplifier without a bypass capacitor compared to a CS amplifier with a bypass capacitor?
a) Voltage gain magnitude decreases
b) Input resistance remains same
c) The output resistance decreases
d) The output is 180° out of phase with respect to the input applied
c
RI = RG for both.
RO = rds with bypass capacitor and rds = rds + (1+μ) RS without a bypass capacitor.
Output is still 180° out of phase compared to applied input, but the gain decreases.
10. Which of these has an output which follows input?
a) CS amplifier with a bypass capacitor
b) CD amplifier
c) CG amplifier
d) CS amplifier without a bypass capacitor
b
But since gm(RS||rds)>>1, gain AV≈1, that is, it acts as a voltage follower. It is also called a source follower.
11. In a CS amplifier, given that rds=0.5MΩ and gm=5mΩ-1, the load is 10kΩ, source resistance is 44 kΩ. Calculate the internal amplification factor for the small signal model.
a) 2500
b) 8100
c) 9800
d) 7700
a
Hence, amplification factor = 2500.
