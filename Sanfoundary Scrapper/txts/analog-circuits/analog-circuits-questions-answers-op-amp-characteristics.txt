1. Consider the ideal op-amp shown and find the correct output.
a)  
b)  
c)  
d) 
b
2. Consider a practical op-amp where the power supply is VCC = +12V and VEE = -12V. The open loop gain is 106 and open loop bandwidth is 5Hz. What is the maximum positive input before which the output is saturated?
a) 12 mV
b) 0.012 mV
c) 24 mV
d) 12V
b
For positive saturation, the maximum allowable input is 12/106 = 0.012 mV.
3. Given an op-amp who’s gain is unknown but the output is saturated, which of the following is not possible?
a) No feedback is being applied
b) Negative feedback is applied while input is more than –VSat/AOL
c) Positive feedback is applied
d) Negative feedback is applied while the input is more than VSat/AOL
b
4. The current flowing into one input of the op-amp is 12nA and it is 10 nA in the other. Find the input offset current.
a) 1nA
b) 2nA
c) -2nA
d) 11nA
b
IIO = 2nA.

5. What is incorrect regarding the output offset voltage of op-amp?
a) It is the output when the input voltage at both input pins of op-amp is zero
b) It occurs due to dissimilarities in the internal structure of the op-amp
c) The output offset voltage does not depend on the supply voltage
d) The output offset voltage can be in the units of Volts
c
6. Given that the PSRR of an op-amp is 120dB. The supply lies between 12V to 15V. Calculate the change in the input offset voltage.
a) 3μV
b) ±3μV
c) ±3×10-12V
d) -3V
b
ΔVIO = ±3/106 = ±3μV.
7. Consider the circuit shown. The input VI = 10sin2π106t. Calculate the duty cycle of the output.
a) 0.43
b) 0.065
c) 0.36
d) 0.5
c
Let input = VI = 10 sinθ
The output goes to +VSat whenever the input VI crosses amplitude of 4V.
Thus 4 = 10sinθ
Θ = sin-1 0.4 = 0.411 rad = 23.57°
The duty cycle = [180 – θ – θ]/360 = 180-47.14/360 = 0.36.
8. An op-amp uses a level shifter internally to prevent the loading effect.
a) True
b) False
a
