c) A = Dual input and unbalanced output differential amplifier, B = Dual input and balanced output differential amplifier, C = Voltage regulator, D = Power amplifier
d) A = Normal amplifier, B = Dual input and unbalanced output differential amplifier, C = Level shifter, D = Dual input and balanced output differential amplifier
a
3. In an ideal op-amp, which is not true?
a) Open loop voltage gain is infinite
b) Input resistance is infinite
c) Slew rate is infinite
d) CMRR is zero
d
4. A practical op-amp has a bandwidth of only 10 Hz. Gain is 106, and the required bandwidth is 100 kHz. How much feedback is required?
a) 0.99% negative feedback
b) 0.99% positive feedback
c) 1% negative feedback
d) 1% positive feedback
a
1 + β106 = 10k
β = 9.999×10-3
In percentage, feedback β = 0.99% negative feedback.
5. Given that for an op-amp the gain is 103, the slew rate is 1.5V/μsec. Input is 5×10-3sinωt, calculate maximum frequency to prevent distortion.
a) 47.7 kHz
b) 0.3 MHz
c) 477 Hz
d) 3 kHz
a
A.Vmω =< 1.5 V/μsec
103.5.10-3.ω = < 1.5×106
ω=<0.3×106
Frequency f = 0.0477×106Hz.
6. Given that CMRR is 100dB. Input common-mode voltage is 12 V. Differential voltage gain is 4000. Calculate output common-mode voltage.
a) 48V
b) 0.48V
c) 20V
d) 11V
b
Log(48000/VOCM) = 5
48000/VOCM = 105
VOCM = 0.48V.
7. The unity gain bandwidth for an op-amp having open loop gain 2×106 is 10 Mhz. Calculate the AC gain of op-amp at an input of 2000 Hz.
a) 2000
b) 5000
c) 10000
d) 12.5
b
fOL = 10M/2×106 = 5Hz
The AC gain |A| = \(\frac{AOL}{\sqrt{1+(f/5)^2}}\) 
|A| = 2×106/400 = 5000.
