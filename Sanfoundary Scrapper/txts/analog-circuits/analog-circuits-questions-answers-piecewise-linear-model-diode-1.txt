b
4. In the given circuit voltage V = 2V.cut-in voltage of diode is 0.7V. Forward resistance is 10Ω. The current I through the circuit is ____________
(Assume piecewise linear model for diode)
a) 0.235mA
b) 1.29mA
c) 1.63mA
d) 2.27mA
d
I = (V-VD)/R1+RD
  = (3-0.7)/1010   = 2.27mA.
5. In the given circuit input voltage Vin is 3V and V2 is 1V. The resistance R1 is 1.5K. Cut-in voltage of diode is 0.5V. Forward bias resistance is 10Ω. The current I will be __________
a) 2.03mA
b) 0.23mA
c) 1.58mA
d) 1.33mA
d
So current I = V1-V2/R
	       = 3-1/1.5k = 1.33mA.
6. In the given circuit input voltage V1 is -3V and V2 is -1V. The resistance R1 is 1K. Cut-in voltage of diode is 0.5V. Forward bias resistance is 10Ω. The approximate current I is _________
(Use piecewise linear model of diode)
a) -1mA
b) -2mA
c) -0.2mA
d) -0.1mA
b
Since voltage across diode is 1V. current I = -3+1/1k = -2mA.
7. In the given circuit input voltage V is 2V and VB is 1V. The resistance R1 and R2 is 1K. Cut-in voltage of diode is 0.5V. Forward bias resistance is 10Ω. The current I will be
(Use piecewise linear model of diode)
a) 0.29mA
b) 0.21mA
c) 0.36mA
d) 0.15mA
a
Current through R1, I1 = 1V/R1 = 1mA.
Current through R2, I2 = (1-VD)/(R2¬+RD) = (1-0.7)/1010 = 0.297mA.
8. In the given circuit input voltage V is 3V and VB is 1V. The resistance R1 and R2 is 1K. Cut-in voltage of diode is 0.5V. Forward bias resistance is 10Ω. The current I will be
(Use piecewise linear model of diode)
a) 0.96mA
b) 2.13mA
c) 1.56mA
d) 1.23ma
c
Let voltage across diode is V0 now voltage across branch is V-V0
Current I = (2-V0)/R1 + (2-V0-VB)/R2 = (2-V0)/1000+((1-V0))/1000 …………………….(1)
V0 = VD + IRD = 0.7+10I
Put this value in eq(1)
That is, I =  (2-0.7-10I)/1000+((1-0.7-10I))/1000  => 1000I = 1.6 – 20I => 1020 I = 1.6
That is, I = 1.6/1020 = 1.56mA.
9. In the given circuit input voltage V is -3V and VB is 1V. The resistance R1 and R2 is 1K. Cut-in voltage of diode is 0.5V. Forward bias resistance is 10Ω. The current I will be

a) 1.2mA
b) 0mA
c) 0.8mA
d) 1mA

a) 1V
b) 3V
c) 2.3V
d) 1.3V
