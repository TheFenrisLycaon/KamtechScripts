a) 2.7V
b) 3V
c) 0.8V
d) 1.5V
b
2. In the circuit shown below voltage Vin is 3V and VB is 2V. The resistor R is 1K. Cut-in voltage of diode is 0.7V. The voltage V is __________
a) 0.3V
b) 1V
c) 3V
d) 0V
d
3. In the circuit shown below voltage Vin is -3V and VB is -2V. The resistor R is 1K. Cut-in voltage of diode is 0.7V. Forward bias resistance is 10Ω. The voltage V is __________
a) -0.29V
b) -4.25V
c) 4.25V
d) 2.9V
b
Net voltage through R and RD is -3-2+0.7 = -4.3V
Current through the circuit is -4.3/(R+RD) = -4.3/(1010) = -0.00425A=-4.25 mA
Hence voltage across R is 1Kx(-4.25mA) = -4.25V.

6. In the circuit shown below voltage Vin is 3V and VB is 1V. The resistor R1 and R2 are 1K. Assume both diodes are identical. Forward bias resistance is 10Ω. Cut-in voltage of diode is 0.7V. The voltage Vout is __________
a) 1.235V
b) 0.234V
c) 1.314V
d) 1.564V
c
Assume I be the current through the circuit. By kirchoff’s voltage rule,
Vout = -VD+IRD+IR2  ————(1)
Current through R1 (Vin-Vout)/1k = (3-Vout)/1k
Current through diode is (Vin-Vout-VD-VB)/RD = (0.3-Vout)/10
Total current I = (3-Vout)/1000+(1.3-Vout)/10  = 1.330-1.010Vout
Substitute this in eq(1)
That is, Vout = -0.7 + 1010(1.33-1.01Vout)
1021Vout = 1342. Therefore, Vout = 1.314V.
7. In the circuit shown below voltage Vin is -3V and VB is -1V. The resistor R1 and R2 are 1K. Assume both diodes are identical. Forward bias resistance is 10Ω. Cut-in voltage of diode is 0.7V. The voltage Vout is __________

8. In the circuit shown below voltage Vin is 3V and VB is 1V. The resistor R1 and R2 are 1K. Assume both diodes are identical. Forward bias resistance is 10Ω. Cut-in voltage of diode is 0.7V. The voltage Vout is __________
a) 1.14V
b) 1.23V
c) 0.32V
d) 1.34V
a
Assume I be the current through the circuit. By kirchoff’s voltage rule,
Vout = IR2  ————(1)
Current through R1 (Vin-Vout-VD)/1.01k = (2.3-Vout)/1010
Current through diode D2 is 0 since D2 is in reverse bias mode.
current I = (2.3-Vout)/1010
Substitute this in eq(1)
That is, Vout = (2.3-Vout)/1010 x 1000  => 1.99Vout = 2.27  => Vout = 2.27/1.99 = 1.144V.
9. In the circuit shown below voltage Vin is 3V and VB1 is -1V and VB2 is 1V. Assume both diodes are identical. Cut-in voltage of diode is 0.7V. Forward bias resistance is 10Ω. The voltage Vout is __________
a) 0.6V
b) 1V
c) 1.7V
d) 2V
a
This circuit can be further reduced to by assuming VB as 1V
By network analysis using kirchoff’s voltage rule current through RD2 will be 0.09A.
The voltage in Vout will be VB+VD-0.09×10 = 0.6V.
10. In the circuit shown below, cut-in voltage of diode is 0.7V. Forward bias resistance is 10Ω. The voltage V is?
a) 0.69V
b) 0.7V
c) 0.68V
d) 0.72V
d
Vout will be IRD+VD = 2mAx10 + 0.7 = 0.72V.
