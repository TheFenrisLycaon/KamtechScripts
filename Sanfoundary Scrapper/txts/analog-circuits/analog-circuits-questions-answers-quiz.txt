After conversion circuit diagram will be as follows
For positive half cycle of V, diode will be forward biased if V is greater than 2.51V (that is we need 1.7V at output and therefore input must be 0.8×1.66/0.33 = 4V.
For negative half cycle output follows input with compression of 0.198.
Therefore, minimum voltage will be -5×0.198 = -0.99V.
