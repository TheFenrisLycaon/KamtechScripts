1. For the circuit given below, which of the following diagram represent Vout if Vin is the signal shown below? (Use constant voltage drop model of diode and take cut-in voltage as 0.7V)
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
For positive half cycle of the input diode conducts and Vout becomes VD. The linear portion of the graph is the point where Vin is positive is because up to 0.7V diode will not conduct and input as such appears on output. When diode is reverse bias there is no current through the diode and hence the voltage will be same as that across the resistor which is connected to ground. It is Vinx1k/(1k+1k).
The minimum voltage across it will be -5/2 = -2.5V and maximum voltage at output is 0.7V
In the diagram, red shows input and green shows output

Hence the circuit is simplified.
When diode D is forward biased it conducts current and hence voltage drop across is VD.
For negative half cycle of the input diode conducts and Vout becomes VD. When diode is reverse bias there is no current through the diode and hence the voltage will be same as that across the resistor which is connected to ground. It is Vinx333.3/(0.33k+1.33k).
The maximum voltage across it will be 0.7V and minimum voltage at output is -1V
