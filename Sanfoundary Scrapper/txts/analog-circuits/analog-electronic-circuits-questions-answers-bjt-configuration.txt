b) VCE and IC
c) VCB and IC
d) VCE and IB
c
3. In a BJT, if the collector-base junction is reverse-biased and the base-emitter junction is forward-biased, which region is the BJT operating in?
a) Saturation region
b) Active region
c) Cutoff region
d) Reverse active region
b
4. In a BJT, if the collector-base junction is forward-biased and the base-emitter junction is forward-biased, which region is the BJT operating in?
a) Saturation region
b) Active region
c) Cutoff region
d) Reverse active region
a
5. In a BJT, if the collector-base junction and the base-emitter junction are both reverse-biased, which region is the BJT operating in?
a) Saturation region
b) Active region
c) Cutoff region
d) Reverse active region
c

a) 3 mA
b) 3.4 mA
c) 0 mA
d) 2 mA
b
7. From the given characteristics, what is the approximate value of IC at VBE=0.7 V and VCE=15 V?
a) 3.4 mA
b) 0 mA
c) 2.5 mA
d) 10 mA
c
8. Which of the following correctly determines the relation between α and β?
a) β=α/(1-α)
b) α=β/(1-α)
c) β=α/(1-β)
d) β=α*(1-β)
a
In a BJT, β = IC/IB. and α = IC/IE
β = αIE/IB = (1+β)α
β = α + αβ
β = α/1-α.

a) True
b) False
b
10. For common emitter configuration, which of the following is the correct relation?
a) IC < IE
b) IC = βIB
c) IC = αIE
d) IC = IE
