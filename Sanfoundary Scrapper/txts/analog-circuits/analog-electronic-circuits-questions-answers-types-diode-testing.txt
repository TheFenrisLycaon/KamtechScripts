b) By changing the doping concentration of the diode
c) By changing the operating temperature
d) By increasing the size of diode
b
8. Which material is generally used for the manufacture of Zener diode?
a) Silicon
b) Germanium
c) Mercury
d) Arsenic
a
9. Which of the following is not a part of the equivalent circuit of a Zener diode?
a) Dynamic Resistance
b) DC Battery
c) Ideal diode
d) Piecewise linear model of diode
c
10. At 298 K, the nominal Zener voltage is found to be equal to 10 V. Given that the value of the temperature coefficient is 0.072 (%/K), what is the nominal Zener Voltage at 398 K?
a) 9.46 V
b) 9.54 V
c) 0.54 V
d) 10.54 V
d
Change in VZ = TC.VZ(T1 – T0))/1000
Change in VZ = 0.54 V
Now, as the value of T is positive, new VZ = 10 + 0.54 V = 10.54 V.
