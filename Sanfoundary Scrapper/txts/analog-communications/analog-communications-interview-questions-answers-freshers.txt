c) class C audio amplifier
d) class B RF amplifier
a
2. The RF section of radio consists both oscillator and buffer stage.
a) True
b) False
a

5. In FM both the frequency and amplitude of carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous value of modulating signal.
a) True
b) False
b
FM (t) = Ac sin (2πfct + βsin(2πfmt)), where symbols have their usual meaning.
6. In the equation, 20cos⁡(108 t + 3 sin⁡109 t) the modulation index is ________
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
c
FM (t) = Ac sin (2πfct + βsin(2πfmt)), where β is the modulation index.
Thus β = 3.
7. Antenna can also be used as a receiver.
a) True
b) False
a
8. What is the advantage of IF modulation?
a) it uses SSB which further reduces its bandwidth
b) modular section and visual exciter can be of any state
c) it cannot be tuned
d) modular section and visual exciter can be solid state devices
d
9. We can use either cone type or horn type loudspeakers in tape recorders.
a) True
b) False
b
