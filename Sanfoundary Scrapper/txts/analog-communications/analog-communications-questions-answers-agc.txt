1. Standard intermediate frequency used for AM receiver is ________
a) 455 MHz
b) 455 KHz
c) 455 Hz
d) 20 KHz
b
2. Which device is used in TV receivers for tuning the receiver to the incoming signal?
a) Varacter diode
b) High pass filter
c) Low pass filter
d) Bandpass filter
a
3. What is the bandwidth occupied by a DSB signal when the modulating frequency lies in the range from 100Hz to 10KHz?
a) 19.8 KHz
b) 19.8 Hz
c) 19.8 MHz
d) 19.8 GHz
a
= 9900Hz. Therefore bandwidth is equal to 2fm = 2 X 9900 = 19.8 KHz.
4. Which statement is true about multiplexing?
a) it is used to reduce the bandwidth
b) it is used to combine multiple data streams over a single data channel
c) it is used to allow multiple data streams over multiple channels
d) it is used to match and pass the same frequency signal
b
5. What is the noise figure of merit for an SSB modulated signal?
a) less than 1
b) greater than 1
c) 1
d) 0.5
c
6. Which amplifier is preferably used for low level modulation?
a) Class C
b) Class A
c) Class AB
d) Class B
b
7. If a receiver has a poor capacity of blocking adjacent channel interference then the receiver has ________
a) Poor selectivity
b) Poor Signal to Noise ratio
c) Poor sensitivity
d) Poor fidelity
a
8. What is the advantage of using a VSB transmission?
a) Higher bandwidth than SSB
b) Less power required as compared to DSB-SC
c) Lower bandwidth than SSB
d) Both higher bandwidth than SSB and less power required as compared to DSB-SC
d
9. What is the value of modulation index m, for overmodulation?
a) m < 1
b) m = 1
c) m > 1
d) m = 0
c
