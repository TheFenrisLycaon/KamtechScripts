1. AM waves is represented by which equation?
a) [1 + m(t)].c(t)
b) [1 – m(t)].c(t)
c) [1 + m(t)].2c(t)
d) [1 + 2m(t)].c(t)
a
Generally, c(t) = Accos(wct), Ac = Amplitude of Carrier Signal.
2. For attenuation of high frequencies we can use ________
a) inductor
b) shunt capacitance
c) series capacitance
d) combination of inductor and resistor
b
3. If each element of signal occupies 40ms, determine its speed?
a) 20 bauds
b) 25 bauds
c) 40 bauds
d) 0.05 bauds
b
4. A modem is classified as low if speed of data rate is ________
a) upto 600bps
b) upto 200bps
c) upto 400bps
d) upto 500bps
a
5. Modulation is also called detection.
a) True
b) False
b
6. It is suitable to connect woofer from the input through ________
a) band pass filter
b) band stop filter
c) low pass filter
d) high pass filter
c
7. The radiation at right angles is zero means ________
a) l = ʎ
b) l = ʎ⁄4
c) l = 2 ʎ
d) l = ʎ⁄2
a
8. Power of carrier wave is 500W and modulation index is 0.25. Find its total power?
a) 500W
b) 415W
c) 375W
d) 516W
d
			So, here, m = 0.25, Pc = 500W
			Pt = (1+(0.252/2))*500 = 516W.
9. Commercial frequency deviation is ________
a) 75 KHz
b) 80 KHz
c) 85 KHz
d) 65 KHz
a
10. Which of the following cannot be the Fourier series of a periodic signal?
a) x(t) = 2Cost + 4Cos7t
b) x(t) = 2Cosπt + 4Cos7t
c) x(t) = Cost + 0.7
d) x(t) = 2Cost + 4Sin7t
c
