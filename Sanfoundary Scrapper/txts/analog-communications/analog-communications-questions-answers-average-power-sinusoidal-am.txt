d
2. Aspect ratio is the ratio of ________
a) width to height
b) height to width
c) power to width
d) width to power
a
3. If the levels in PCM are transmitted in 10 unit code having sampling frequency equals to 20KHz. What is its bandwidth?
a) 150KHz
b) 125KHz
c) 100KHz
d) 110KHz
c
			Bit Rate = 10 X 20 = 200
			Bandwidth = 200/2 = 100 KHz.
