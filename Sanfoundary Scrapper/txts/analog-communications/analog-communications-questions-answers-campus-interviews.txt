1. Calculate power in each sideband, if power of carrier wave is 176W and there is 60% modulation in amplitude modulated signal?
a) 13.36W
b) 52W
c) 67W
d) 15.84W
d
2. For 100% modulation, power in each sideband is ________ of that of carrier.
a) 50%
b) 70%
c) 60%
d) 25%
d
3. Overmodulation results in ________________
a) Distortion
b) Weakens signal
c) Strengthens the signal
d) provides immunity to noise
a
4. The maximum power efficiency of an AM modulator is?
a) 25%
b) 33%
c) 66%
d) 100%
b
 For maximum efficiency m = 1 so, ή = 1/(1+2) = 1/3
 and ή% = (1/3)x100 = 33%.
5. Noise performance of a square law demodulator of AM signal is?
a) Better than that of synchronous detector
b) Weaker than that of synchronous detector
c) Better than that of envelope detector
d) Weaker than that of envelope detector
a
6. For getting 100% modulation, carrier amplitude should  ________
a) exceed signal amplitude
b) be equal to signal amplitude
c) be lesser than signal amplitude
d) be equal to 0
b
Modulation Index (m) = Vm/Vc, where Vm is maximum baseband or message signal amplitude and Vc is maximum carrier signal amplitude. So for m = 1, Vm should be equal to Vc.
7. For 100% modulation, total power is?
a) same as the power of unmodulated signal
b) twice as the power of unmodulated signal
c) four times as the power of unmodulated signal
d) one and half times as the power of unmodulated signal
d
So, for m=1,
 Pt = Pc (1 + 12/2)  = 1.5 Pc.
8. An AM signal is represented by x(t) = (30 + 2Sin(700πt)) Cos(2πt x 102t)V. What is the value of modulation index?
a) 0.7
b) 0.066
c) 0.341
d) 0.916
b
Comparing it with general AM equation, s(t) = Ac(1 + mAm cos(wmt)) cos(wct),
Where, Ac = Amplitude of Carrier Signal, Am = Amplitude of Message Signal
	m=Modulation Index
So modulation index(m) = 0.066.
9. An AM signal is represented by x(t) = (30 + 2Sin(700πt)) Cos(2πt x 102t)V. Carrier power of the wave is?
a) 555W
b) 675W
c) 450W
d) 310W
c
Hence Pc = 450W. 
10. An AM signal is represented by x(t) = (30 + 2Sin(700πt)) Cos(2πt x 102t)V. Find the total power of amplitude modulated wave?
a) 453W
b) 675W
c) 789W
d) 451W
d
			So, here, m = 0.066, Pc = 450W
			Pt = (1+(0.0662/2))*450 = 451W.
 
11. An AM signal is represented by x(t) = (30 + 2Sin(700πt)) Cos(2πt x 102t)V. What is its sideband power?
a) 4W
b) 1W
c) 3W
d) 2W
b
