1. Notch is a ________
a) High pass filter
b) Low pass filter
c) Band stop filter
d) Band pass filter
c
2. Sin wave is ________
a) Aperiodic Signal
b) Periodic Signal
c) Random Signal
d) Deterministic Signal
b
3. What is the role of channel in communication system?
a) acts as a medium to send message signals from transmitter to receiver
b) converts one form of signal to other
c) allows mixing of signals
d) helps to extract original signal from incoming signal
a
4. Sum of a periodic and aperiodic signal always be an aperiodic signal.
a) True
b) False
b
For example: Let f(x) = sin(x), be a periodic function with period 2π and g(x) = −sin(x) + sin(√2x), be an aperiodic function. Now the sum of both i.e. f(x) + g(x) = sin(√2x), which is a periodic function.
Therefore, the sum of a periodic and aperiodic signal can be periodic.
5. Noise is added to a signal ________
a) In the channel
b) At receiving antenna
c) At transmitting antenna
d) During regeneration of information
a
6. Agreement between communication devices are called ________
a) Transmission medium
b) Channel
c) Protocol
d) Modem
c
7. What is the advantage of superheterodyning?
a) High selectivity and sensitivity
b) Low Bandwidth
c) Low adjacent channel rejection
d) Low fidelity
a
8. Low frequency noise is ________
a) Flicker noise
b) Shot noise
c) Thermal noise
d) Partition Noise
a
9. Relationship between amplitude and frequency is represented by ________
a) Time-domain plot
b) Phase-domain plot
c) Frequency-domain plot
d) Amplitude-domain plot
c
10. A function f(x) is even, when?
a) f(x) = -f(x)
b) f(x) = f(-x)
c) f(x) = -f(x)f(-x)
d) f(x) = f(x)f(-x)
b
While for a function f(x) to be odd, f(x) = -f(-x).
