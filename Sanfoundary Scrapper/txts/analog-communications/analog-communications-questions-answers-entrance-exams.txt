1. Consider a wave, v = 15 sin (3πt + 5sin1300t), what is the carrier and signal frequency?
a) 2.5Hz and 200Hz
b) 1.5Hz and 100Hz
c) 1.5Hz and 207Hz
d) 5.5Hz and 500Hz
c
			FM(t) = Ac sin(2πfct + βsin(2πfmt)),
			Therefore,
Signal and Carrier frequency are respectively 
2. SWR is 1 for ________
a) Open or Short Circuit
b) Open circuit only
c) Short circuit only
d) Series or Parallel Circuit
a
3. The resonance frequency of an amplifier is 7MHz and it is having a bandwidth of 10KHz. What is its Q factor?
a) 7000
b) 70
c) 700
d) 7
c
				= 7MHz/10KHz = 700.
4. Which chart is used for calculations of transmission lines?
a) Andre chart
b) Smith chart
c) Wilson chart
d) Federer chart
b
5. What is the effective power if the transmitted power of 5W is increased to 50dB?
a) 100KW
b) 300KW
c) 500KW
d) 700KW
c
10log10 (P/5) = 50.
So, P = 500KW.
Where, P = Effective Power, Pt = Transmitted Power.
6. Field intensity follows ________
a) Bragg’s law
b) Inverse square law
c) Coulomb’s law
d) Gauss’s law
b
7. If the power density at a given distance ‘R’ is one microwatt per square meter and the effective area of antenna is one square meter then the power captured by antenna is one microwatt.
a) True
b) False
a
where,
Power Density = 1 mW
Pt = Power captured by antenna,
Area of antenna = 4πR2 = 1m2.
8. The gain of antenna (G) is the ratio of power radiated in a particular direction to the power radiated from an isotropic antenna.
a) True
b) False
a
9. EM waves are attenuated as they travel.
a) True
b) False
a
