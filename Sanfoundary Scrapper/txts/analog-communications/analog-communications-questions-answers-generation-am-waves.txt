1. Which of the following devices is used to generate AM waves?
a) Square-law modulator
b) Reactance modulator
c) Transmitter
d) Transducer
a
2. What is the disadvantage of FM over AM?
a) high modulating power is needed
b) requires high output power
c) large bandwidth required
d) high noise is produced
c
3. For low level amplitude modulation, amplifier must be ________
a) Class C amplifier
b) Class B amplifier
c) Class D amplifier
d) class A amplifier
a
4. Approximate range of a cordless telephone is ________
a) 900m
b) 100m
c) 1000m
d) 475m
b
5. A wave is modulated by two sin waves having modulation indices of 0.3 and 0.5. Find the total modulation index?
a) 0.1

6. Carrier wave carries information.
a) True
b) False
b
7. What can we do to eliminate distortion in the picture?
a) use a longer transmission line
b) change the antenna orientation
c) use  a short transmission line
d) connect a booster
b
8. For 100% amplitude modulation, the power in upper sideband when carrier power is to be 100W?
a) 100W
b) 75W
c) 25W
d) 50W
c
Modulation index, m = 100% = 1.
Power in sidebands = (Pcx m2/4), Pc = Power of Carrier
By substituting the values, we have (100 x 1/4) =  25W.
9. Modem is considered as high speed if data rate is ________

b) 20000
c) 5000
d) 30000
c
10. Scanning always takes place from ________
a) right to left
b) left to right
c) left to right for odd fields and right to left for even fields
d) left to right for even fields and right to left for odd fields
b
