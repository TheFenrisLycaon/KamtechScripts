1. Which of the following oscillator is not used in frequency modulation?
a) Colpitts Oscillator
b) Crystal Oscillator
c) Hartley Oscillator
d) Both Colpitts and Crystal Oscillator
b
2. In frequency modulation, noise gets decreased if we decrease deviation.
a) True
b) False
b
3. Which device is most commonly used for detection in radio receiver?
a) Triode
b) Capacitor
c) Diode
d) Transistor
c
4. ________ modulator is an indirect way of generating FM.
a) Varactor FET
b) Reactance FET
c) Armstrong
d) Reactance bipolar transistor
c
5. Three point tracking is achieved by __________
a) Double conversion
b) Variable selectivity
c) Variable Sensitivity
d) Padder capacitor
d
6. The household radio receiver uses __________ detector.
a) Synchronous
b) Coherent
c) Radio
d) Envelope
d
7. High IF in superheterodyne receiver ____________
a) improves fidelity
b) improves selectivity
c) improves sensitivity
d) increases tracking problems
d
8. If the step size of a system is 0.0721, find its quantization power?
a) 3.25 x 10-3
b) 4.33 x 10-4
c) 4.33 x 10-2
d) 3.25 x 10-1
b
Therefore, Quantisation power = ∆2/12, where ∆=0.0721
				  = (0.07212)/12 = 4.33 X 10-4.
9. Find the step size of a signal with peak to peak amplitude of 8V and is quantized into 40 levels?
a) 0.8
b) 1
c) 0.2
d) 0.6
c
Step size,
