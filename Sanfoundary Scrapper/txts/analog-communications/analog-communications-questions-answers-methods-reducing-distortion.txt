1. Quantization error occurs in ________
a) Time Division Multiplexing
b) Frequency Division Multiplexing
c) Pulse Code Modulation
d) Pulse Width Modulation
c
2. If power transmitted is 90kW, what is the field at a distance of 45km?
a) 2
b) 1
c) 0.036
d) 0.01
c
3. Find the number of pulses, if the number of quantization levels is 32 in PCM?
a) 3
b) 6
c) 4
d) 5
d
Therefore, number of pulse in quantisation level =  2n = 32, so n = 5, where n = Quantization Level.
4. Which transistor amplifier is most commonly used?
a) Common Base
b) Common Emitter
c) Common Collector
d) None of these
b
5. A device uses a 8 bit word then the maximum number of words it can transmit is ________
a) 64
b) 256
c) 1024
d) 512
b
Therefore, when n = 8,
Number of words it can transmit is 28 = 256.
6. Peak voltage of a carrier is 8kV, each sideband has an amplitude of 800V. Find its modulation index?
a) 0.28
b) 0.09
c) 0.02
d) 0.08
c
Psb = Power of each sideband
			Therefore, (mVc 2)/2 = Vsb 22 (Vc  = 8000 V, and Vsb = 800)
Therefore, m = (8002 X 2) / 80002 = 0.02.
7. What do you understand by the term Cross talk?
a) generation of closely lying sidebands
b) a method of increasing bandwidth
c) a method of decreasing bandwidth by converting DSB-SC signal to SSB-SC
d) disturbance caused in nearby circuit due to transmitted signal
d
8. AM waves is represented by Et cos ⁡ωc t. What does Et  denotes?
a) envelope
b) carrier signal
c) modulating signal
d) amplitude
a
9. Wireless communication takes place through ________
a) EM waves
b) X-Rays
c) Optical Fibres
d) Infrared Waves
a
10. Which modulation technique uses minimum bandwidth?
a) DSB-SC
b) SSB-SC
c) FM
d) VSB
b
