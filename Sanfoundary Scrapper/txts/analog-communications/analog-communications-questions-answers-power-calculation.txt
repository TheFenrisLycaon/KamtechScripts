1. If peak voltage of a carrier wave is 10V, what is the peak voltage of modulating signal if modulation index is 50%?
a) 10V
b) 20V
c) 8V
d) 5V
d
where Vm = Peak voltage of modulating signal,
	Vc = Peak voltage of a carrier wave = 10V,
Therefore, Vm = 10 X 0.5 = 5V.
2. Maximum Amplitude of an amplitude modulated 10V and minimum amplitude is 5V. Find its modulation index?
a) 0.65
b) 0.9
c) 0.33
d) 1
c
			Where, Vmax = Maximum Amplitude of an amplitude modulated = 10V
			             Vmin = Minimum amplitude  of an amplitude modulated = 5V
Therefore, µ = (10-5)/(10+5) = 0.33. 
3. 24 channels, each band limited to 3.4 KHz, are to be time division multiplexed. Find the bandwidth required for 128 quantization level?  (Given that sampling frequency is 8 KHz)
a) 2436 KHz
b) 1002 KHz
c) 1536 KHz
d) 1337 KHz
c
m = 128,
2n = m = 128, n = 7
But fs = 2fm, where, fs = sampling  frequency
instead at 2fm  2 x 3.4 kHz   6.8 KHz.
B.W. = N(n+1)X fs  = [24(7 + 1)] 8 kHz = 1536 KHz.
4. Sampling frequency of a signal is 6 KHz and is quantized using 7 bit quantizer. Find its bit rate?
a) 48kbPs
b) 64kbPs
c) 16kbPs
d) 8kbPs
a
Bit rate is also known as bitrate or data rate.
Bit rate, Rb = 1⁄Tb  where  where n = number of bits and fs = Sampling Frequency
Tb = 1/42, therefore Bit rate = 42 Kbps.
5. Calculate power in each sideband, if power of carrier wave is 96W and there is 40% modulation in amplitude modulated signal?
a) 11.84W
b) 6.84W
c) 3.84W
d) 15.84W
c
6. For 50% modulation, power in each sideband is ________ of that of carrier.
a) 10%
b) 4.32%
c) 5%
d) 6.25%
d
7. For 100% modulation, total power is ________
a) 1.5Pc
b) 2Pc
c) 3.75Pc
d) 1.25Pc
a
where µ = 1 (for 100% modulation),
 so Pt = Pc(1 +(12/2)). On solving it we get Pt = 1.5Pc.
8. If each element of signal occupies 70ms, what will its speed?
a) 11.23 bauds
b) 14.28 bauds
c) 17.39 bauds
d) 13.33 bauds
b
9. Power of carrier wave is 300W and modulation index is 0.75. Find its total power?
a) 465W
b) 384W
c) 323W
d) 502W
b
where Modulation Index (µ) = 0.75,
So Pt, 
10. If a wave is modulated by two waves. One of them has modulation index equal to 0.75 and other has 0.2, the total modulation index will be ________
a) 0.67
b) 0.58
c) 0.77
d) 0.35
c
11. Find the power saving for DSB-SC wave with 100% modulation?
a) 66%
b) 86%
c) 50%
d) 33%
a
So Total Power required in DSBSC Modulation = (u2XPc)/2 = Pc/2
In normal AM, carrier is not suppressed.
So total power required in AM Modulation = (1+(u2/2))XPc = 3Pc/2
Therefore, Power saving = ((Pc/2)/(3Pc/2)) x 100% = 66%.
12. If power transmitted is 45kW, field at a distance of 23km will be ________
a) 0.02
b) 0.75
c) 0.05
d) 0.03
c
13. Find the number of pulses, if the number of level is 128 in PCM?
a) 3
b) 6
c) 4
d) 7
d
Therefore,
2n = 128, so n = 7.
