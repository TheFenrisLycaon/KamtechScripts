1. If the modulating frequency of a carrier wave varies between 700Hz and 7KHz, find it’s bandwidth?
a) 10 KHz
b) 23 KHz
c) 17.3 KHz
d) 12.6 KHz
d
Vmax = Maximum Amplitude of an amplitude modulated,
			 Vmin = Minimum amplitude  of an amplitude modulated,
fm = 7KHz – 700Hz = 6.3KHz
Bandwidth = 2fm = 2 x 6.3 = 12.6 KHz.
2. A 400W carrier wave is modulated to a depth of 65%. Find the total power of modulated wave?
a) 512.5W
b) 493W
c) 484.5W
d) 609.6W
c
where Modulation Index (µ) = 0.65,
 so Pt = 400 (1 +0.652⁄2). On solving it we get Pt = 484.5W.
3. Inductance and capacitance of a line is 0.8 μH⁄m and 32 pF⁄m. Find  Z0?
a) 158
b) 166
c) 143
d) 127
a
.
4. Find VSWR of a line having maximum and minimum value equals to 120mV and 40mV respectively?
a) 3
b) 2
c) 1
d) 4
a
5. A 1000 KHz carrier is modulated with 300 Hz, 8000 Hz and 2 KHz waves. Determine the frequencies whose chances of occurring in output is least?
a) 1000 KHz
b) 1002 KHz
c) 998 KHz
d) 999.2 KHz
a
6. If average power of a transmitter is 4kW and maximum power is 20000KW. What is its duty cycle?
a) 2 x 10-3
b) 2 x 10-4
c) 3 x 10-3
d) 0.05
b
7. The voltage and electric current of a line are respectively 5kV and 1000μA. Find its power?
a) 12W
b) 13W
c) 5W
d) 10W
c
Power, P = V x I. By substituting the values of voltage(V) and current(I), we have P = (5×103)(1000×10-6) = 5W.
8. ________ microphones works on piezoelectric effect.
a) Crystal
b) Carbon
c) Moving coil
d) Condenser
a
9. If modulation index of an AM wave is increased from 1.5 to 2, then the transitted power ________
a) remains same
b) increases by 20%
c) increases by 41%
d) increases by 50%
c
.
= 0.41 x 100
= 41%
Therefore,  there is an increase in total power by 41%.
