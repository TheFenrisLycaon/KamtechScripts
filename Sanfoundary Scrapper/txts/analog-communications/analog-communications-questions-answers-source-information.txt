1. FM stands for ________
a) Frequency Modulation
b) Frequency Modulator
c) Frequent Frequent Multiplier
d) Frequency Mixer
a
2. Why a sinusoidal signal is considered analog?
a) It moves in both positive and negative direction
b) It is positive for one half cycle
c) It is negative for one half cycle
d) It has an infinite number of amplitudes in the range of values of the independent variable
d
3. The minimum height of antenna required for transmission in terms of ʎ is ________
a) 3ʎ⁄2
b) ʎ⁄4
c) 2ʎ
d) ʎ
b
(H = ʎ⁄4 where ʎ = c⁄f). The reason for maintaining antenna height to ʎ/4 is for matching impedance. It means that the antenna is atleast 1/4th above ground level.
4. What do you understand by the term analog communication?
a) A method in which one of the properties of a carrier signal varies in proportion to an instantaneous value of modulation signal
b) A way for data and computer communication
c) A numerical coded communication
d) A suitable method for long distance communication
a
5. What is Demodulation?
a) Process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform
b) Recovering information from a modulated signal
c) Process of mixing a signal with a sinusoid to produce a new signal
d) Involvement of noise
b
6. Data transmitted for a given amount of time is called ________
a) Noise
b) Power
c) Frequency
d) Bandwidth
d
7. If Output can be represented as linear combination of input then ________
a) The system is linear
b) The system is causal
c) The system is non causal
d) The system is time invariant
a
8. Amplitude Modulation suffers from ________
a) Side-band Suppression
b) IntraPulse Modulation
c) Cross Modulation
d) Carrier Suppression
c
9. Medium which sends information from source to receiver is called ________
a) Transmitter
b) Transducer
c) Loudspeaker
d) Channel
d
10. Telephones send information through wires in form of ________
a) radio signals
b) electrical signal
c) electromagnetic waves
d) microwaves
b
11. Cell phones sent information in form of ________
a) microwaves
b) electrical signals
c) infrared Waves
d) radio waves
d
12. The ability of receivers to select the wanted signals among various incoming signal is called ________
a) Selectivity
b) Fidelity
c) Sensitivity
d) Modulation
a
13. Which device is used for tuning the receiver according to incoming signal (especially in TV)?
a) Low pass filter
b) High pass filter
c) Zener diode
d) Varacter diode
d
