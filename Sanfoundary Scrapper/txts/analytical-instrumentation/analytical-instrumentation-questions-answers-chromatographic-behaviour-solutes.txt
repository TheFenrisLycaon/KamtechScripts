1. How is the molar concentration of solute in stationary phase related to molar concentration of solute in the mobile phase?
a) Directly proportional
b) Inversely proportional
c) Equal
d) Not related
a
Cs α Cm
Cs = k Cm
‘k’ is the distribution constant.
2. If the value of the distribution constant ‘k’ is one, then what could be inferred about the distribution of solute?
a) Its distribution in stationary phase is greater
b) Its distribution in mobile phase is greater
c) It is equally distributed in stationary and mobile phase
d) It is distributed in a random manner
c
Cs α Cm
Cs = k Cm
If k=1, it denotes that the solute is equally distributed in the mobile and stationary phase.
