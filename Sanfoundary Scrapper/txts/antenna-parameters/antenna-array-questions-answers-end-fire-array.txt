1. The direction of maximum radiation in end-fire array is ______ with respect to the array axis.
a) 0° or 180°
b) 90°
c) 45°
d) 270°
a
2. What is the phase excitation difference for an end-fire array?
a) 0
b) ±kd /2
c) π
d) ±kd
d
And φ=kdcosθ+β
=> kdcosθ+β=0 For an end-fire array maximum radiation is along the axis of array so
 θ=0° or 180°
=> β=kd when θ=180°
=> β=-kd when θ=0°
3. The phase excitation difference is zero in end-fire array.
a) True
b) False
b
4. What is the phase excitation difference in end-fire array with array spacing d at  θ=0°?
a) \(-\frac{2π}{λ} d \) 
b) \(\frac{2π}{λ} d \) 
c) \(-\frac{π}{λ} d \) 
d) \(\frac{π}{λ} d \) 
a
kdcosθ+β=0
β=-kd
\(β=-\frac{2π}{λ} d \) 
5. Which of the following statements is true regarding end-fire array?
a) The necessary condition of an ordinary end-fire array is β=±kd+nπ
b) The phase excitation difference is zero
c) Same input current is fed through the array, but the phase excitation is varies progressively
d) Maximum radiation occurs at normal to the axis of array
c
Phase excitation difference β=±kd
Maximum radiation occurs along the axis of the array that is at θ=0° or 180°.
Even though same input current s fed to the arrays of equal magnitude, the phase vary progressively along the line to get the unidirectional pattern.
6. What is the progressive phase excitation of an end-fire array with element spacing λ/4 at θ=180°?
a) \(\frac{π}{2}\) 
b) \(-\frac{π}{2}\) 
c) π
d) \(\frac{π}{4}\) 
a
Therefore \(β=\frac{π}{2}\) 
7. Find the overall length of an end-fire array with 10 elements and spacing λ/4.
a) \(\frac{9λ}{4}\) 
b) \(\frac{5λ}{4}\) 
c) \(\frac{5λ}{2}\) 
d) \(\frac{9λ}{2}\) 
a
⇨	ρ=(N-1)d=(10-1)(λ/4)=9 λ/4
8.  Which of the following is the correct condition of an ordinary end-fire array?
a) β=±kd
b) β=kd
c) β > kd
d) β < ±kd
a
 θ=0° or 180°
=> β=kd when θ=180°
=> β=-kd when θ=0°
