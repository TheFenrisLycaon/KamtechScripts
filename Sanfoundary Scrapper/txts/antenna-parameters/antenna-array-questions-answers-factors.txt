b) \(cos⁡(\frac{π}{2})\) 
c) \(cos⁡(\frac{3π}{4})\) 
d) \(cos⁡(\frac{3π}{2})\) 
a
⇨	\(AF_n=cos⁡(\frac{kdcosθ+β}{2})=cos⁡(\frac{(\frac{2π}{λ})(λ/4)cosθ+0}{2})=cos⁡(\frac{π}{4})\) 
4. Which of the following pattern represents the array factor of a two element array separated by a distance of λ/4 and phase difference is 0?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
⇨	AFn=0
⇨ \(cos⁡(\frac{kdcosθ+β}{2})=0\) 
⇨ ⁡\(\frac{(\frac{2π}{λ})(λ/4)cosθ+0}{2})=\frac{π}{2}\) 
⇨	cosθ=2
 No Nulls will occur for the given pattern. So the pattern is represented as
5. Which of the following is true for uniform linear array elements, to obtain the total field?
a) The single element field is multiplied by the array factor
b) The single element field is multiplied by the normalized array factor
c) The single element field is multiplied by the beamwidth
d) The single element field is multiplied by the directivity
a
6. Multiplying the normalized field with the normalized array factor gives ___________
a) pattern multiplication
b) array factor
c) beamwidth
d) null
a
7. Find the angle at which nulls occur for the two element array antenna with separation λ/4 and phase difference is π/2?
a) 0
b) π/2
c) π/4
d) π
a
⇨	AFn=0
⇨ \(cos(\frac{kdcosθ+β}{2})=0\) 
⇨ ⁡\(\frac{(\frac{2π}{λ})(λ/4)cosθ+\frac{π}{2}}{2}=\frac{π}{2}\) 
⇨	Cosθ=1
⇨ θ=0
So Nulls occur at 0°.
8. Find the angle at which nulls occur for the two element array antenna with separation λ/4 and phase difference is -π/2?
a) 0
b) π/2
c) π/4
d) π
d
⇨	AFn=0
⇨ \(cos⁡(\frac{kdcosθ+β}{2})=0\) 
⇨	\(\frac{(\frac{2π}{λ})(\frac{λ}{4})cosθ-\frac{π}{2}}{2}=±\frac{π}{2}\) 
⇨	Cosθ=-1
⇨	θ=180 or π
So Nulls occur at 180°.
9. Find the angle at which nulls occur for the two element array antenna with separation λ/4 and phase difference is 0?
a) Doesn’t exist
b) 0
c) π/2
d) π/4
a
⇨	AFn=0
⇨ \(cos⁡(\frac{kdcosθ+β}{2})=0\) 
⇨	\(\frac{(\frac{2π}{λ})(λ/4)cosθ+0}{2}=\frac{π}{2}\) 
⇨ cosθ=2
 No Nulls will occur for the given pattern.
10. For N- element linear uniform array, the normalized array factor is represented as ______________

c) \(N\frac{sin(ᴪ/2)}{ᴪ/2}\) 
d) \(N\frac{cos(Nᴪ/2)}{Nᴪ/2}\) 
a
Normalized array factor is given by \(\frac{sin(Nᴪ/2)}{Nᴪ/2}\)
