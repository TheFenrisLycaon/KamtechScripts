6. Which of the following is the resultant pattern obtained by pattern multiplication principle for the figure shown below?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
7. Which of the following doesn’t applicable for pattern multiplication?
a) It is the product of the individual radiation pattern of the element with the array factor of the array
b) All elements must be identical
c) All elements need not be identical
d) This gives the radiation pattern of the entire array
c
8. For two elements array find the radiation pattern of array separated by λ/4 and phase difference is 0?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
Etotal=Eθ×Array Factor=0
Eθ=0 =>cosθ=0,θ=±π/2
Or
⇨	Array Factor=0
⇨ AFn=0
⇨ \(cos⁡(\frac{kdcosθ+β}{2})=0\) 
⇨ \(\frac{(\frac{2π}{λ})(λ/4)cosθ+0}{2}=\frac{π}{2}\) 
⇨ cosθ=2
9. The total radiation pattern of a two element array, elements separated by a distance λ/4 and phase difference \(\frac{π}{2},\) the nulls occur at (for far field) ____________
a) 0, ±π/2
b) π, ±π/2
c) π, ±π/4
d) π/4, ±π/2
a
⇨ AFn=0
⇨ \(cos⁡(\frac{kdcosθ+β}{2})=0\) 
⇨ \(\frac{(\frac{2π}{λ})(λ/4)cosθ+\frac{π}{2}}{2}=\frac{π}{2}\) 
⇨	Cosθ=1
⇨ θ=0
So Nulls occur at 0°.
For far field, the Eθ=0 => cosθ=0, θEθ=0	cosθ=0, θ=±π/2
Therefore nulls occur atθ=±\(\frac{π}{2}, \) 0.
10. The isotropic element array radiation pattern depends on the nulls of the array factor only.
a) True
b) False
a
