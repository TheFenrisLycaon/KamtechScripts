1. What is the radiation resistance of an antenna if it radiates 1kW and current in it is Irms=10A?
a) 0.1Ω
b) 1Ω
c) 10Ω
d) 100Ω
c
⇨	Rrad=\(\frac{P_{rad}}{I_{rms}^2} = \frac{1000}{10×10}=10\Omega\)
2. What is the radiation resistance of an antenna if input power to it is 1KW and current in it is 10A having a power loss of 200W?
a) 10Ω
b) 2Ω
c) 12Ω
d) 8Ω
d
⇨	Prad=Pin-Ploss=1000-200=800W
Now, Power radiated Prad=Irms2Rrad
⇨	Rrad=\(\frac{P_{rad}}{I_{rms}^2} = \frac{800}{10×10}\)=8Ω
3. What is the radiation resistance of a short dipole of length L?
a) 20π2 \((\frac{L}{\lambda})^2\) 
b) 80π2 \((\frac{l}{\lambda})^2\) 
c) 40π2 \((\frac{l}{\lambda})^2\) 
d) 160π2 \((\frac{l}{\lambda})^2\) 
a
Then short dipole is of length l/2, so the radiation resistance is given by R=80π2\((\frac{L/2}{\lambda})^2=20\pi^2 (\frac{L}{\lambda})^2.\)
4. If the length of the dipole decreases, then the radiation resistance will________
a) increase
b) decrease
c) depends on current distribution
d) not change
b
5. For a half-wave dipole with length λ/12, what is the antenna efficiency if the Radiation resistance is 2Ω?
a) 0.73
b) 0.073
c) 0.37
d) 0.78
a
Antenna efficiency \(\eta=\frac{R_{rad}}{R_{rad}+R_{loss}}=\frac{5.48}{5.48+2}=0.73\)
6. Find the radiation resistance of a Hertzian dipole of length 1m and operating at a frequency 1MHz?
a) 0.08Ω
b) 8.8mΩ
c) 8.8Ω
d) 0.88Ω
b
Radiation resistance of a Hertzian dipole is given by \(R=80π^2(\frac{l}{\lambda})^2=80π^2 (\frac{1}{300})^2\)=0.0088Ω
7. Radiation resistance doesn’t depend on direction of power radiated but depends on the frequency.
a) True
b) False
a
8. What is the radiation resistance of the antenna radiating at 5kW and having maximum current 2A?
a) 25kΩ
b) 2.5kΩ
c) 0.25kΩ
d) 2.5Ω
b
Power radiated \(P_{rad}=I_{rms}^2 R_{rad}\) 
⇨	\(R_{rad}=\frac{P_{rad}}{I_{rms}^2} = \frac{5K}{2}=2.5k\Omega\)
9. Power radiated by half-wave dipole with maximum current amplitude 10A is ______
a) 3.65kΩ
b) 3.650Ω
c) 0.365kΩ
d) 36.50Ω
a
 \(I_{rms}=\frac{I_m}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}=5\sqrt{2}\) 
Power radiated Prad=Irms2 Rrad=(5√2)2×73=3650Ω=3.65kΩ
10. The radiation resistance dissipates same amount of power as it radiated by the antenna.
a) True
b) False
a
