1. Relation between Quality factor, Bandwidth, and resonant frequency is _________
a) \(Q=\frac{BW}{f_0}\) 
b) \(Q=\frac{f_0}{BW}\) 
c) Q = BW×f0
d) \(Q=\frac{BW+f_0}{BW-f_0}\) 
b
2. What is the Bandwidth of the antenna operating at resonant frequency 200MHz with Quality factor 20?
a) 10Hz
b) 5MHz
c) 10MHz
d) 0.1MHz
c
3. What is the length of the half-wave dipole with bandwidth 20MHz and Quality factor 30?
a) 5m
b) 0.25m
c) 0.50m
d) 2.5m
b
Now, \(λ=\frac{c}{f}=\frac{3×10^8 m/s}{600MHz}=0.5m\) 
∴ Length of half-wave dipole is \(l=\frac{λ}{2}=\frac{0.5}{2}=0.25m\)
4. Quality factor is defined as ________
a) \(2π×\frac{energy \,radiated\, per\, cycle}{Total\, energy\, stored\, by\, antenna}\) 
b) \(4π×\frac{Total \,energy \,stored \,by\, antenna}{energy\, radiated\, per \,cycle}\) 
c) \(4π×\frac{energy \,radiated\, per \,cycle}{Total \,energy\, stored \,by \,antenna}\) 
d) \(2π×\frac{Total \,energy\, stored\, by \,antenna}{energy\, radiated \,per \,cycle}\)
