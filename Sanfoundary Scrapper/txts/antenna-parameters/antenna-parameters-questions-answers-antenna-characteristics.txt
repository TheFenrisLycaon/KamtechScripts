1. A linear antenna having length less than λ/8 is called as _______
a) Short monopole
b) Short dipole
c) Half-wave dipole
d) Quarter-wave monopole
a
2. Find the power radiated by an antenna whose radiation resistance is 100Ω and operating with 3A of current at 2GHz frequency?
a) 900W
b) 1800W
c) 450W
d) 700W
a
3. Front-to-Back ratio is defined as ratio of power radiated in desired direction to the power radiated in back lobe.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Relation between beam solid angle Ω, horizontal half-power beam width ∅A, vertical half-power beam width ∅E is __________
a) Ω≈∅A.∅E
b) Ω≈∅A+∅E
c) Ω≈∅A/∅E
d) Ω≈∅A-∅E
a
5. Which of the following field varies inversely with r2?
a) Far field
b) Near field
c) Radiation field
d) Electrostatic field
b
6. Find the effective area of a half-wave dipole operating at frequency 100MHz and directive gain 1.8?
a) 1.28m2
b) 2.18m2
c) 0.128m2
d) 12.8m2
a
\(\lambda = \frac{c}{f}=3×\frac{10^8}{100×10^6}=3m\) 
\(A_e=\frac{3^2}{4π}×1.8=1.28m^2\)
