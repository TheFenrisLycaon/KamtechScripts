a) Te=To (F-1)
b) Te=To/(F-1)
c) Te=To/(F+1)
d) Te=To (F+1)
a

9. Which of the following statement is false?
a) Noise power of antenna depends on the antenna temperature as well as the noise due to the receiver surroundings
b) Noise figure value lies between 0 and 1
c) Any object with physical temperature greater than 0K radiates energy
d) Noise power per unit bandwidth is kTA  W/Hz
b
And object with physical temperature greater than 0K radiates energy. So \(\frac{T_e}{T_o}\) > 0 and F > 1
Noise power per unit bandwidth of antenna is kTA  W/Hz while noise power of antenna is kTAB W

b) 1
c) 0
d) 1/T_(o )
a
Te=To(F-1)
	F-1=1
	F=2.
