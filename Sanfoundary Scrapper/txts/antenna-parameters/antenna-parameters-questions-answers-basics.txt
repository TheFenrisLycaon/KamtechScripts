1. The relation between vector magnetic potential and current density is given by ______
a) ∇.A=J
b) ∇×A=H
c) ∇2 A=-μJ
d) ∇2 A=∇×H
c
Taking curl on both sides, we get ∇×B=∇×(∇×A )  = ( ∇.A)∇-(∇.∇)A
From Maxwell’s equation, ∇.B=0 =>∇.A=0
⇨	∇×B= -∇2 A and  B= μH , ∇×H=J
⇨	∇×μH= -∇2A
⇨	∇2 A=-μJ.
2. The induction and radiation fields are equal at a distance of _______
a) λ/4
b) λ/6
c) λ/8
d) λ/2
b
\(\mid \overline{E_θ}\mid_{max⁡Radiation} =\mid \overline{E_θ}\mid_{max⁡Induction} \) 
\(\frac{I_m dl}{4\pi\epsilon} (\frac{ω}{v^2r})=\frac{I_mdl}{4\pi\epsilon} (\frac{1}{r^2v})\) 
\(r=\frac{v}{ω}=\frac{\lambda f}{2\pi f}=\frac{\lambda}{6}.\) 
3. The ratio of radiation intensity in a given direction from antenna to the radiation intensity over all directions is called as ________
a) Directivity
b) Radiation power density
c) Gain of antenna
d) Array Factor
a
 Radiation Intensity is power radiated from an antenna for unit solid angle. \(U_0= w_r.r^2\frac{watts}{steradians}.\) 
Gain of antenna is ratio of radiation intensity in given direction to the radiation intensity of isotropic radiation. Array factor is a function of geometry of array and the excitation phase.
4. What is the overall efficiency of a lossless antenna with reflection coefficient 0.15?
a) 0.997
b) 0.779
c) 0.669
d) 0.977
d
Overall efficiency of antenna is given by eo =ecd (1-\(\mid\gamma^2\mid)\)=1×(1-(0.152))=0.977.
5. The equivalent area when multiplied by the instant power density which leads to free radiation of power at antenna is called as _______
a) Loss area
b) Scattering area
c) Captured area
d) Effective area
b
Captured area= effective area + loss area + scattering area.
6. Equivalent circuit representation of an antenna is ______
a) Series R, L, C
b) Parallel R, L, C
c) Series R, L parallel to C
d) Parallel R, C series to L
a
7. Radiation resistance of a Hertzian dipole of length λ/8 is ________
a) 12.33Ω
b) 8.54Ω
c) 10.56Ω
d) 13.22Ω
a
R=80π2\((\frac{l}{\lambda})^2=80\pi^2 (\frac{\lambda/8}{\lambda})^2=12.33\Omega\)
8. Relation between directivity and effective area of transmitting and receiving antenna is ________
a) Dt At=Dr Ar
b) Dt Ar=Dr At
c) At Dt=∈Dr Ar
d) Dt At=∈Dr Ar
b
\(P_r = \frac{P_tD_tA_r}{4\pi R^2} => D_tA_r = \frac{P_r}{P_t}4\pi R^2\) = Dr At
∴ Dt Ar=Dr At
9. The axis of back lobe makes an angle of 180° with respect to the beam of an antenna.
a) True
b) False
a
10.Radiation resistance of a half-wave dipole is ______
a) 36.56Ω
b) 18.28Ω
c) 73.12Ω
d) 40.24Ω
c
11. The radiation efficiency for antenna having radiation resistance 36.15Ω and loss resistance 0.85Ω is given by ________
a) 0.977
b) 0.799
c) 0.997
d) 0.779
a
Radiation efficiency is also known as conductor-dielectric efficiency. It is the ratio of power delivered to the radiation resistance to the power delivered to it when conductor-dielectric losses are present.
