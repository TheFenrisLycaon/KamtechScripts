1. For an isotropic antenna, the average power Pav  can be expressed in terms of radiated power Pr as ____
a) Pav=Pr/4π
b) Pav=Pr/2πr2
c) Pav=Pr/2π
d) Pav=Pr/4πr2
d
∴ Pav=Pr/4πr2
2. Directive gain is defined as a measure of concentration of power in a particular direction.
a) True
b) False
a
\(G_d = \frac{P_{d(\theta,\emptyset)}}{P_{avg}}\) 
3. What is the directive gain when the magnitude of radiation intensity equals to average radiation intensity?
a) 4π
b) ∞
c) 1
d) 0
c
 ∴ \(G_d = \frac{U_{(\theta,\emptyset)}}{U_{avg}}\)=1.
4. Directive gain of antenna when radiation intensity is 5W/Steradian and radiated power 5W is ____
a) 4π
b) 1/4π
c) 25
d) 1
a
Directive gain \(G_d=\frac{P_{d(\theta,\emptyset)^{r^2}}}{P_r/4\pi} = \frac{U_{d(\theta,\emptyset)}}{P_r/4\pi}=4\pi\) 
5. The Directive gain is ______ on input power to antenna and _____ on power due to ohmic losses.
a) Independent, independent
b) Dependent, independent
c) Independent, dependent
d) Dependent, dependent
a
So, the Directive gain is independent on both input power to antenna and power due to ohmic losses.
Power gain is dependent on input power and ohmic losses to antenna.
6. What is the maximum directive gain of antenna with radiation efficiency 98% and maximum power gain 1?
a) 0.98
b) 1.02
c) 1.98
d) 1
b
Therefore Gdmax=1/0.98=1.02
7. Which of the following expression is correct for radiation efficiency?
a) \(\eta_r=\frac{R_r}{R_l}\) 
b) \(\eta_r=\frac{R_r}{R_r-R_l}\) 
c) \(\eta_r=\frac{R_r}{R_r+R_l}\) 
d) \(\eta_r=\frac{R_l}{R_r+R_l}\) 
c
\(\eta_r = \frac{P_r}{P_{in}} = \frac{P_r}{P_r+P_l} = \frac{R_r I_{rms}^2}{I_{rms}^2 R_r+I_{rms}^2 R_l} = \frac{R_r}{R_r+R_l} \)
8. For a lossless antenna, maximum Power gain equals to the maximum directive gain.
a) True
b) False
a
