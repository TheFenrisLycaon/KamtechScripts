1. The ratio of maximum power density in the desired direction to the average power radiated from the antenna is called as _______
a) directivity
b) directive gain
c) power gain
d) partial directivity
a
2. What is the Beam area for Directivity to be 1 in Steradian?
a) 4π
b) 1/2π
c) 2π
d) 1/4π
a
⇨ \(\frac{4\pi}{D}\)=4π steradians.
3. If directivity of antenna increases, then the coverage area _____
a) decreases
b) increases
c) increases and then decreases
d) remains unchanged
a
4. If half power beam width in one plane and other plane orthogonal to it are equal to π then the directivity is ____
a) π
b) 4π
c) 4/π
d) 2π
c
Directivity \(D=\frac{4\pi}{\Omega_A}=\frac{4\pi}{\theta_{1r}\theta_{2r}}=\frac{4\pi}{\pi.\pi} = 4/\pi\)

5. Directive gain with maximum radiation intensity is called as Directivity.
a) True
b) False
a
6. How the directivity and effective aperture related to each other?
a) Inversely proportional
b) Directly proportional
c) Independent
d) Proportionality depends on input power
b
7. What is the directivity of half-wave dipole?
a) 1.64
b) 1.5
c) 1.43
d) 1.44
a
Prad=36.54I02 Since the radiation resistance for Half-wave dipole is 36.54Ω.
Maximum radiation intensity is given by \(U_{max}=P_{max}.r^2=\frac{\mid E_\theta\mid_{max}^2}{2\eta}.r^2\) 
Where \(E_\theta=\frac{j\eta I_0 e^{-jkr}cos⁡(\frac{\pi cos\theta}{2})}{2\pi rsin\theta}\) 
⇨	\(D=\frac{4\pi}{1}\frac{\eta I_0^2}{8\pi^2} \frac{1}{36.54I_0^2}=1.64.\)
8. What is the directivity of antenna having effective aperture 1 m2?
a) \(\frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2}\) 
b) \(\frac{\lambda^2}{4\pi}\) 
c) 1
d) 4π
a
Given effective aperture Ae=1m2
⇨ D=\(\frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2}A_e = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2}  × 1 =\frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2}\)
