1. An ideal source in which the power is radiated equally in all directions is called as ________ radiator.
a) Isotropic
b) Omni-directional
c) Directional
d) Transducer
a
2. In Isotropic radiation, which of the following vector component is absent in pointing vector?
a) \(\widehat{a_r}\) 
b) \(\widehat{a_\theta}\) 
c) \(\widehat{a_\emptyset}\) 
d) Both \(\widehat{a_\theta} \,and\, \widehat{a_\emptyset} \) 
d
3. What is the amount of Electric field present at a distance of 10km for an isotropic radiator with radiating power 3kW?
a) 30mV/m
b) 60mV/m
c) 15mV/m
d) 10mV/m
a
From pointing theorem, \(P=\frac{\mid E_{max}^2\mid}{2\eta}\), where η=120π. —– (2)
Equating (1) & (2) and Erms=Emax/√2, we get
\(E_{rms}=\frac{\sqrt{30P_t}}{r}=\frac{\sqrt{30×3000}}{10000}=30mV/m.\)
4. What is the radiation intensity for isotropic antenna having radiation power density \(\frac{3 sin⁡θ}{r^2}a_r W/m^2\)?
a) 3sinθ ar W/Steradian
b) 3cosθar W/Steradian
c) 6πsinθ ar W/Steradian
d) 6πcosθ ar W/steradian
a
U= Wr.r2= 3sinθ ar W/Steradian.
5. For an isotropic source, Radiation intensity will be _____ on θ and ______ on Φ.
a) Dependent, independent
b) Independent, independent
c) Independent, dependent
d) Dependent, dependent
b
∴ Radiation intensity \(U=\frac{P_{total \,rad}}{4π}\)
6. Find the effective length of a receiving antenna with open circuit voltage 1V and incident electric field 200mV/m?
a) 0.2m
b) 50m
c) 5m
d) 5cm
c
