1. The ratio of power radiated in a particular direction to the total input power of antenna is called as _____
a) Directive gain
b) Power gain
c) Directivity
d) Partial directivity
b
2. What is the maximum power gain of antenna with radiation efficiency 98% and directive gain 1?
a) 0.98
b) 1.02
c) 1.98
d) 1
a
∴ Gpmax=0.98×1=0.98.
3. Which of the following expression is correct for radiation efficiency?
a) \(\eta_r = \frac{P_r}{P_l}\) 
b) \(\eta_r = \frac{P_r}{P_r-P_l}\) 
c) \(\eta_r = \frac{P_r}{P_r+P_l}\) 
d) \(\eta_r = \frac{P_l}{P_r+P_l}\) 
c
\(\eta_r = \frac{P_r}{P_{in}} = \frac{P_r}{P_r+P_l}\) 
4.  Which of the following represents the relation between maximum power gain and maximum directivity gain of the antenna?
a) Gpmax = ηrGdmax
b) Gpmax = ηr/Gdmax
c) ηr = \(\sqrt{(G_{pmax} G_{dmax})}\) 
d) ηr = \(\frac{G_{dmax}+G_{pmax}}{G_{dmax}-G_{pmax}}\) 
a
Maximum directive gain  Gdmax=\(\frac{U_{max}}{P_r/4π}\, and\, \eta_r=\frac{P_r}{P_{in}}\) 
∴Gpmax=ηr Gdmax
5. What is the maximum power gain when the radiation resistance is 72Ω, loss resistance is 8Ω and the maximum directive gain is 1.5?
a) 1.15
b) 1.35
c) 1.25
d) 1.53
b
Radiation efficiency ηr=\(\frac{R_r}{R_r+R_l}=\frac{72}{72+8}=\frac{72}{80}=0.9\) 
Now, Gpmax=ηr Gdmax=0.9×1.5=1.35
6. The radiation efficiency value is ______
a) 0
b) 1<η<∞
c) 0≤η≤1
d) ∞
c
Rr+Rl>Rr So \(\frac{R_r}{R_r+R_l}\) < 1 and If Rl=0 then ηr=1
Therefore, the value of efficiency lies in the range 0 to 1.
7. The value of maximum power gain is always greater than or equal to the maximum directive gain.
a) True
b) False
b
