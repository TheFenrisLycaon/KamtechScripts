1. Units of radiation intensity is _______
a) Watts/unit Solid angle
b) Watts/m2
c) Watts- m2
d) Watts
a
2. The graphical representation of the radiation properties of the antenna as a function of space coordinates is called Radiation pattern.
a) True
b) False
a
3. What is the total power radiated in Watts for the power density \(w_r=\frac{4sin\theta}{3r^2}a_r W/m^2\)?
a) 4π2
b) 8π2/3
c) 4π2/3
d) 2π2/3
c
\(=\iint_{\theta = 0}^{\pi} w_r.r^2 sin\theta d\theta d\emptyset\) 
\(=\iint_{\theta = 0}^π\frac{4sin\theta}{3r^2}r^2sin\theta d\theta d \emptyset\) 
\(=\iint_{\theta = 0}^π \frac{4}{3}sin^2\theta d\theta d\emptyset=\iint_{\theta=0}^π\frac{4}{3}(\frac{1-cos2\theta}{2})d\theta d\emptyset\) 
\(=\frac{4}{3}(\frac{1}{2})(π)(2π)=\frac{4}{3}\) π2.
