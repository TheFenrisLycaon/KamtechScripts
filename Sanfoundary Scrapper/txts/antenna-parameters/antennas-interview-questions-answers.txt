1. Which of the following modes does the condition πD << λ is satisfied in helical antenna?
a) Axial mode
b) Normal mode
c) Conical mode
d) Axial, Normal and Conical
b
In Normal mode: πD << λ
     Axial mode:  C ≈ λ
     Conical mode: C ≈n λ
2. What is the pitch angle of the helical antenna to become a loop antenna?
a) 90
b) 0
c) 45
d) 60
b
When pitch angle α=0, the separation becomes zero and length will be equal to circumference of the loop. Hence it acts as a loop antenna.
3. What is the pitch angle if the separation of turns is at 2 cm and the circumference is of 4 cm?
a) 26.56
b) 62.65
c) 30
d) 25.34
a
4. What is the necessary condition for a helical antenna to operate in the axial mode?
a) πD << λ
b) πD ≈ λ
c) πD ≈ nλ
d) πD=0
b
    		 Axial mode:  C ≈ λ
		    Conical mode: C ≈n λ
D=0 then there is no loop and is no longer helical.
5. What is the pitch angle of the helical antenna to become a linear antenna?
a) 90
b) 0
c) 45
d) 60
a
When pitch angle α=90, the separation between turns becomes parallel to length (tending to infinity pitch angle) hence it acts as a linear antenna.
6. What is the Input impedance of the axial feed helical antenna with circumference per unit wavelength is 1.2?
a) 168Ω
b) 186Ω
c) 198Ω
d) 158Ω
a
\(Z=140 \frac{C}{λ}=140×1.2=168\Omega\) 
7. What is the total axial length of the helical antenna with 5 turns and circumference per wavelength is 1.2 and separation between turns is 2 cm?
a) 10cm
b) 20cm
c) 6cm
d) 12cm
a
A=NS=5 * 2 = 10cm
8. The Axial ratio of the helical antenna with 3 turns is _____
a) 1.11
b) 0.89
c) 6
d) 0.98
a
\(AR = \frac{2N+1}{2N} = \frac{7}{6} = 1.11\) 
9. Find the number of turns in the helical antenna with directivity 120 and Cλ=1 and pitch angle 6°.
a) 100
b) 50
c) 120
d) 12
a
Pitch angle \(α=tan^{-1}⁡\frac{S_λ}{C_λ}\) 
⇨ Sλ=Cλ tan α=1*0.1=0.1
D = 12CλnSλ
120=12×1×n×0.1
n=100 turns
10. Which of the following type does helical antenna belongs to?
a) Wire type
b) Aperture
c) Reflector
d) Array
a
