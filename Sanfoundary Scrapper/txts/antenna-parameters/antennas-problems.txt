1. The reflection factor is given by the ratio of ____________
a) Reflected wave to incident wave
b) Incident wave to reflected wave
c) Sum of reflected and incident waves to difference of reflected and incident waves
d) Difference of reflected and incident waves to sum of reflected and incident waves
a
\(ρ=\frac{reflected \,wave}{incident\, wave}=\frac{E_r}{E_i} \) 
ρ=1 It means that surface is perfect reflecting medium.
2. What is the reflection coefficient for a perfect reflecting surface?
a) 1
b) 0
c) <1
d) >1
a
\(ρ=\frac{reflected \,wave}{incident \,wave}=\frac{E_r}{E_i} \) 
For a perfect reflecting surface, total incident waves are reflected completely. Er = Ei
\(ρ=\frac{E_r}{E_i}=1.\) 
3. What is the reflection coefficient if there are no any reflections?
a) 1
b) 0
c) <1
d) >1
b
\(ρ=\frac{reflected \,wave}{incident \,wave}=\frac{E_r}{E_i} \) 
No reflections means Er = 0 =>ρ = 0
4. Which of the following holds true for Brewster angle?
a) It is about the angle of reflection
b) It is the angle of incident at which no reflections occur
c) It is the angle of incident at which maximum reflections occur
d) It is about the angle of refraction
b
\(θ=tan^{-1}⁡\sqrt{\frac{ϵ_{r2}}{ϵ_{r1}}} \)  
5. Reflection coefficient of plane waves with normal incidence in terms of impedances of medium is ____
a) \(γ_r=\frac{η_2-η_1}{η_2+η_1} \) 
b) \(γ_r=\frac{2η_2}{η_2+η_1} \) 
c) \(γ_r=\frac{2η_1}{η_2+η_1} \) 
d) \(γ_r=\frac{η_2+η_1}{η_2-η_1} \) 
a
\(ρ=\frac{reflected\, wave}{incident\, wave}=\frac{E_r}{E_i} \) 
Reflection coefficient of plane waves with normal incidence in terms of impedances of medium is \(γ_r=\frac{η_2-η_1}{η_2+η_1} \)
6. Relation between transmission coefficient  γt and reflection coefficient is  γr is
a) γr= γt-1
b) γr= γt+1
c) γr= γt-2
d) γr= (γt-1) / γt+1
a
Transmission coefficient is the ratio of transmitted to incident wave. The reflection factor is given by the ratio of Reflected wave to incident wave.
7. Transmission coefficient of a plane wave with normal incidence is _________
a) \(γ_t=\frac{2η_2}{η_2+η_1} \) 
b) \(γ_t=\frac{η_2}{η_2+η_1} \) 
c) \(γ_t=\frac{2η_2}{η_2+η_1} \) 
d) \(γ_r=\frac{η_2-η_1}{η_2+η_1} \) 
a
So the Transmission coefficient of a plane wave with normal incidence is \(γ_t=\frac{2η_2}{η_2+η_1} \)  
8. Complex dielectric constant of earth is given by ____
a) \(ϵ’=ϵ+\frac{σ}{jw} \) 
b) \(ϵ’=σϵ+\frac{1}{jw} \) 
c) \(ϵ’=σ+\frac{ϵ}{jw} \) 
d) \(ϵ’=ϵ+\frac{σϵ}{jw} \) 
a
9. Which of the following is the expression for tilt angle?
a) \(θ=1/2 tan^{-1}⁡(\frac{σ}{ωϵ})\) 
b) \(θ=2 tan^{-1}⁡(\frac{σ}{ωϵ})\) 
c) \(θ=1/2 tan^{-1}⁡(\frac{σϵ}{ω})\) 
d) \(θ=2 tan^{-1}⁡(\frac{wϵ}{σ})\) 
a
10. Find the tilt angle of the radio wave with 1MHz frequency and conductivity of earth is 5 ×10-3S/m and relative permittivity 10?
a) 41.8°
b) 83.6°
c) 48.1°
d) 38.6°
a
\(=0.5 tan^{-1}⁡(\frac{5 ×10^{-3}}{2π×10^6×10×(\frac{1}{36π}) 10^{-9}})≈41.8°\) 
11. Brewster angle doesn’t exist for perpendicular polarization.
a) True
b) False
a
\(θ=tan^{-1}⁡\sqrt{\frac{ϵ_{r2}}{ϵ_{r1}}}\) 
At θ =90, tan θ=∞, which doesn’t exist in reality.
