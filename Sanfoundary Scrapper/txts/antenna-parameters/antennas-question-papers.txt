1. Which of the following antenna belongs to rectangular aperture?
a) Horn antenna
b) Helical antenna
c) Parabolic antenna
d) Conical antenna
a
2. The radiation pattern of rectangular is similar to line source integrated in two directions
a) True
b) False
a
3. The total pattern function for rectangular aperture f(x, y) if f(x) and f(y) are separable is given by ____
a) f(x, y)=f(x) f(y)
b) f(x, y)=f(x)+f(y)
c) f(x, y)=f(x)/f(y)
d) f(x, y)=f(x)-f(y)
a
4. The first-level of the side lobe occurs at ______ dB for a uniform rectangular aperture antenna.
a) -13.26
b) -6.63
c) 3
d) 8.5
a
5. A rectangular aperture a ×b is placed in xy-plane, The HPBW in H-plane is given by _____
a) 0.886λ/a
b) 0.443λ/a
c) 0.5λ/b
d) λ/b
a
\(\frac{sin⁡(0.5kasin\theta)}{0.5kasin\theta} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} => \theta =arcsin⁡(\frac{0.443\lambda}{a})\) 
Now HPBW = \(2 arcsin⁡(\frac{0.443\lambda}{a}) \approx 0.886\lambda/a.\)
6. The relation between directivity and the effective aperture of the uniform aperture antenna is given by _____
a) \(D = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2}A_{eff}\) 
b) \(A_{eff} = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2}D\) 
c) \(A_{eff} = \frac{4\pi\lambda^2}{D}\) 
d) \(D = \frac{4\pi\lambda^2}{A_{eff}}\) 
a
The relation between directivity and the effective aperture of the antenna is given by
\(D = \frac{4\pi}{\lambda^2}A_{eff}\).
7. Which of the following is used to reduce side lobe levels in aperture antenna?
a) Tapering
b) Increasing the power
c) Using repeaters
d) Reducing power
a
8. The principle plane pattern of the E-plane of rectangular aperture of a×b is given by F(θ) = ______
a) \(\frac{sin⁡(0.5kbsin\theta)}{0.5kbsin\theta}\) 
b) \(\frac{cos⁡(0.5kbcos\theta)}{0.5kbsin\theta}\) 
c) \(\frac{sec⁡(0.5kbsin\theta)}{0.5kbsin\theta}\) 
d) \(\frac{1-sin⁡(0.5kbsin\theta)}{0.5kbsin\theta}\) 
a
F(θ) = \(\frac{sin⁡(0.5kbsin\theta)}{0.5kbsin\theta}\) and main lobe occurs when θ =0.
9. Tapering is done in order to reduce the side lobe level.
a) True
b) False
a
10. If the aperture antenna is tapered only in H-plane then which of the following is true compared to uniform non-tapered aperture antenna?
a) Principle patterns in E-plane and H-plane are same in both cases
b) Principle patterns in E-plane and H-plane are different in both cases
c) Principle patterns in E-plane is same and H-plane is different
d) Principle patterns in E-plane is different and H-plane is same
c
