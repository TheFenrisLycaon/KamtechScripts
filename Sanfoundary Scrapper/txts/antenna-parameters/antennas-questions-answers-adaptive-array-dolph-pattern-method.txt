1. Which of the following a method proposed to design array with any side lobes?
a) Dolph-Chebyshev
b) Binomial array
c) Taylor
d) Broad-side Array
a
2. Dolph pattern uses which of the following polynomial approximation?
a) Chebyshev
b) Binomial
c) Pascal’s
d) Taylor
a
3. What should be the side lobe level to make Dolph Chebyshev to binomial array?
a) -∞ dB
b) 0 dB
c) 1 dB
d) 10dB
a
So side lobes a =0
Side lobe level = major lobe level / minor lobe max =0
In dB = 20 log (1/a) = -∞ dB.
4. Which of the following represents the chebyshev recursive formula?
a) Tm(z) = 2zTm-1(z) – Tm-2(z)
b) Tm(z) = zTm-1(z) – 2Tm-2(z)
c) Tm(z) = 2Tm-1(z) – zTm-2(z)
d) Tm(z) = Tm-1(z) – 2zTm-2(z)
a
Tm(z) = 2zTm-1(z) – Tm-2(z).
5. What is the HPBW of the Dolph Chebyshev array if the broadening factor is 2 and HPBW of uniform array is 30°?
a) 30°
b) 60°
c) 90°
d) 120°
b
=2×30°=60°.
6. In Chebyshev array which of the following is approximated to the Chebyshev polynomial?
a) Array factor
b) HPBW
c) Side lobe level
d) Range equation
a
