1. What is a Balun?
a) It is used to balance the unbalanced systems
b) It unbalances the balanced systems
c) A twisted wire
d) Main beam of antenna with large beam width
a
2. A Balun is used to make the current along the outer side of the outer conductor along the coaxial cable _______
a) Zero
b) Maximum
c) Maximum or minimum depends on power supply
d) Infinity
a
3. The process of forcing the current at the outer side of the outer conductor to be zero is called _____
a) Current distribution
b) Current chokes
c) Field effect
d) Impedance chokes
a
4. A Balun joins a balanced line and an unbalanced line.
a) True
b) False
a
5. All Baluns provide impedance transformation.
a) True
b) False
b
6. For a 4: 1 Balun, what is the unbalanced impedance if the balanced impedance is 2KΩ?
a) 8K
b) 0.5K
c) 4K
d) 2K
b
Unbalanced impedance = 2K/4=0.5K.
7. Among current Balun and voltage Balun, which works better?
a) Current Balun
b) Voltage Balun
c) Both work equally
d) Depends the power supply
a
8. Which of the following is false regarding Transformer Balun?
a) It has a narrow band frequency
b) It has infinitely wide band frequency
c) Ideally it provides zero insertion loss
d) Impedance matching is adjusted by its turn ratio
a
9. The phase difference between the outputs of Balun in frequency domain is ____
a) 180°
b) 120°
c) 60°
d) 90°
a
10. For an unbalanced to balanced signal conversion, if the turn’s ratio in a Balun is 1:2 then the balanced impedance is ______ times the unbalanced impedance.
a) 4
b) 2
c) \(\frac{1}{2} \) 
d) \(\frac{1}{4} \) 
a
⇨	Zbal = 4Zunbal
So the balanced impedance is four times the unbalanced impedance.
