b) Linear array
c) End-fire array
d) Chebyshev array
a
2. The excitation amplitudes of the binomial array follow ____________
a) Pascal’s triangle
b) Bermuda triangle
c) Right angled triangle
d) Natural squares
a
   1
  1 1
 1 2 1  
1 3 3 1
The array factor AF = (1-z)N-1 and N is number of elements.
3. Which of following is the disadvantage of the binomial array?
a) It has low amplitude variations
b) It has high range of amplitude variations
c) It has a high HPBW
d) It has low HPBW
a
4. Binomial array has high HPBW compared to Dolph-chebychev.
a) True
b) False
a
5. Which of the following can be the excitation amplitude of binomial array with 4 elements?
a) 1 3 3 1
b) 1 2 3 1
c) 2 1 1 2
d) 1 4 6 4 1
a
     1	            N=1
    1 1     	    N=2 
   1 2 1   	    N=3  
  1 3 3 1	    N=4
The array factor AF = (1+z)N-1 and N is number of elements.
6. Dolph- Chebyshev becomes a Binomial array when there are no side lobes.
a) True
b) False
a
7. What will be the array factor in polynomial form for the 3 element binomial array if Z=e^(-iᴪ)?
a) 1+2z+z2
b) 1+3z+3z2+z3
c) 1+2z+3z2+z3
d) 1+3z+z2
a
AF = (1+z)3-1 = (1+z)2 = 1+2z+z2
Binomial array follows the Pascal’s triangle coefficients
