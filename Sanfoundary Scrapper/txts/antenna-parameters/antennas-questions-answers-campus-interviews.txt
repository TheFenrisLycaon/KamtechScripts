1. Which of the following statement is not correct?
a) Folded dipole antenna has less impedance than half dipole
b) Folded dipole is a balanced antenna
c) Folded dipole antenna is a dipole antenna with its end folded back forming a loop
d) Balun is used at the feeder when unbalanced feed is used in the folded dipole
a
2. Folded dipole antenna belongs to which type of antenna?
a) Reflector
b) Aperture
c) Lens
d) Wire
d
3. What is the input impedance of a half wave folded dipole?
a) 73Ω
b) 292Ω
c) 146Ω
d) 36.5Ω
b
So Z= 4×73=292Ω
4. A half wave folded dipole of 3 wires has the impedance _____Ω.
a) 675
b) 657
c) 219
d) 292
b
5. In which of the following type of folded dipole the number of conductors is varied?
a) Multi conductor folded dipole
b) Unequal conductor folded dipole
c) Both multi conductor and unequal conductor
d) Neither multi conductor nor unequal conductor
a
6. In unequal conductor folded dipole, the diameter of the conductor of feed arm and the non feed arm are unequal.
a) True
b) False
a
\(Z = Z’\left(1+\frac{log⁡(\frac{a}{r1})}{log⁡(\frac{a}{r2})}\right)^2.\) 
7. If the radii of two conductors are r1 (feed arm), r2 (non feed arm) and separated by a distance,then the impedance transformation for a half folded dipole is given by _______
a) \(\left(1+\frac{log⁡(\frac{a}{r1})}{log⁡(\frac{a}{r2})}\right)^2\) 
b) \(73\left(1+\frac{log⁡(\frac{a}{r1})}{log⁡(\frac{a}{r2})}\right)^2\) 
c) \(\left(1+\frac{log⁡(\frac{a}{r2})}{log⁡(\frac{a}{r1})}\right)^2\) 
d) \(73\left(1+\frac{log⁡(\frac{a}{r2})}{log⁡(\frac{a}{r1})}\right)^2\) 
b
\(Z = Z’\left(1+\frac{log⁡(\frac{a}{r1})}{log⁡(\frac{a}{r2})}\right)^2\) 
For a half dipole Z’=73Ω
∴ \(Z = 73\left(1+\frac{log⁡(\frac{a}{r1})}{log⁡(\frac{a}{r2})}\right)^2\) 
8. For a multi conductor folded dipole with n conductors, the impedance is ____ Ω.
a) 2n Z
b) nZ
c) n2Z
d) Z/n
c
Where value of radiation resistance Z depends on the length of the dipole used.
9. Which of the following causes the shortening effect on multi conductor folded dipole?
a) Only thickness of conductors
b) Space between conductors
c) Radiation resistance of the dipole
d) Both the radii and radiation resistance
a
10. On which of the following factors does the overall impedance of the unequal conductor folded dipole depends?
a) Only thickness of conductors
b) Space between conductors
c) Radiation resistance of the dipole
d) Radii, radiation resistance and space between conductors.
d
\(Z = Z’\left(1+\frac{log⁡(\frac{a}{r1})}{log⁡(\frac{a}{r2})}\right)^2\) and Z’ is the radiation resistance of the dipole used (which depends on the length of the dipole).
So the overall impedance depends on radii, radiation resistance of the dipole and space between conductors.
