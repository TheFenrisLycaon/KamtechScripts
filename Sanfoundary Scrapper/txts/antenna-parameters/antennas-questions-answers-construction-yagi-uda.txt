1. The length of the director compared to the driven element is ______
a) Greater
b) Smaller
c) Independent to each other
d) Depends on the type of driven element
b
2. The length of the reflector compared to the driven element is ______
a) Greater
b) Smaller
c) Independent to each other
d) Depends on the type of driven element
a
3. The distance between directors of Yagi-Uda antenna is ____
a) 0.2λ
b) 0.49λ
c) 0.52λ
d) 0.62λ
a
4. What is the approximate distance between directors for a Yagi-Uda antenna operating at frequency 150MHz?
a) 0.4m
b) 1.6m
c) 2m
d) 4.8m
a
The distance between directors of Yagi-Uda antenna is 0.2λ
⇨	D=0.2λ=0.2(2)=0.4m
5. If length of the reflector, driven element, director islr, lde, ld, respectively then the order in the increasing order of their lengths is _____
a) lr, lde, ld
b) ld, lde, lr
c) lde, lr, ld
d) lr, lde, lde
b
So, the increasing order is ld, lde, lr .
6. For a feeder length of 0.5λ, which among the following would be the reflector length?
a) 0.525λ
b) 0.425λ
c) 0.23λ
d) 0.35λ
a
So, l = 0.525λ is correct as it is the only option which is greater than 0.5λ.
7. If the input impedance of a half wave dipole Yagi-Uda is 73Ω, then input impedance of a half wave folded dipole as driven element is ____
a) 73Ω
b) 146Ω
c) 36.5Ω
d) 292Ω
d
⇨	Z = 4 × 73 = 292Ω.
8. What is the reflector length (in feet) for a three element Yagi-Uda array, operating at a frequency 500MHz?
a) 2
b) 0.2
c) 1
d) 0.1
c
Reflector length (feet) = 500/f (MHz) = 500/500 = 1 feet
9. What is the driven length (in feet) for a three element Yagi-Uda array, operating at a frequency 500MHz?
a) 0.95
b) 0.2
c) 1
d) 2
a
Driven element length (feet) = 475/f (MHz) = 475/500 = 0.95 feet.
10. What is the Director length (in feet) for a three element Yagi-Uda array, operating at a frequency 500MHz?
a) 0.91
b) 1
c) 2
d) 0.5
a
Director element length (feet) = 455/f (MHz) = 455/500 = 0.91 feet.
11. For a feeder length of 0.5λ, which among the following would be the director length?
a) 0.525λ
b) 0.455λ
c) 0.493λ
d) 0.55λ
b
⇨	0.5-(0.5(5/100)) = 0.475
So, l = 0.455λ is correct as it is the only option which is less than 0.475λ.
