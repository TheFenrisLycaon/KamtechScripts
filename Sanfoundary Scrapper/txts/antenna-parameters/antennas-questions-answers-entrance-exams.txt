1. Which of the following statement is true about the Chebyshev function Tm(x)?
a) It is a continuously increasing function after x=1
b) It is a continuously decreasing function after x=1
c) It is a continuously increasing function after x=0
d) It is a continuously decreasing function after x=0
a
T1(x) = x
T2(x) = 2x2-1
⇨	T3(x) = 4x3-3x
This is the chebyshev polynomial and it increases continuously after x=1
2. How many times the polynomial T5(x) crosses the x-axis between [-1, 1]?
a) 5
b) 4
c) 2
d) 6
a
M=5 therefore it crosses the axis 5 times between [-1, 1].
3. Which of the following statements is true?
a) The polynomials are unstable at interval [-1, 1] 
b) The polynomials are marginally stable at interval [-1, 1] 
c) The polynomial doesn’t oscillate at interval [-1, 1] 
d) The polynomials crosses the axis m-1 times at [-1, 1] 
b
4. What is the possible level from the following for the minor lobe when the main beam level is at 50db and SLL at 10 db according to Chebyshev?
a) 40dB
b) 45dB
c) 50dB
d) 80dB
a
Possible level for the minor lobe is 50-10=40dB
5. The condition for the existence of the main lobe according to the Chebyshev is _________
a) |x| > 1
b) |x| < 1
c) |x| = 0
d) 2|x| > 1
a
The condition for the existence of the minor lobe according to the Chebyshev is |x| < 1.
6. The condition for the existence of the main lobe according to the Chebyshev is _________
a) |x| > 1
b) |x| < 1
c) |x| = 0
d) 2|x| > 1
a
The condition for the existence of the minor lobe according to the Chebyshev is |x| < 1.
7. Which of the following statements regarding Chebyshev polynomial is true?
a) The polynomial Tm(x) is symmetric for m = even
b) The polynomial Tm(x) is symmetric for m = odd
c) The polynomial Tm(x) is anti-symmetric for m = even
d) The polynomial Tm(x) is symmetric for m = even and odd
a
For m=even, at x=0 it is 1. For m=odd, at x=0 it is 0.
8. Which of the following properties of Chebyshev polynomial is false?
a) The minor lobes have unequal amplitudes
b) The polynomial Tm(x) is symmetric for m = even
c) The polynomial Tm(x) crosses the x axis m times between -1 and 1
d) Minor lobes exists for |x| < 1
a
Minor lobes exist for |x| < 1 and major lobes exist for |x| > 1.
9. All the polynomials of the order m pass through the point ____________
a) (1, 1)
b) (0, 0)
c) (0, 1)
d) (-1, 0)
a
 = (1, 1).
T0(x) = 1
T1(x) = x
T2(x) = 2x2-1
T3(x) = 4x3-3x
10. All the nulls occur at (-1, 1) in the Chebyshev polynomial.
a) True
b) False
b
(-1, 1) here is representing a point. So it is false.
11. As the order of the polynomial increases, the slope becomes steeper.
a) True
b) False
a
T0(x) = 1 m=0
T1(x) = x m=1
T2(x) = 2x2-1 m=2
T3(x) = 4x3-3x m=3
As the order of the polynomial increases, the slope becomes steeper.
