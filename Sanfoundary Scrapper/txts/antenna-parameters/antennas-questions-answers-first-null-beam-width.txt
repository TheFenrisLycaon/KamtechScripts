1. Angular width between the first nulls or first side lobes is called as _______
a) half power beam width
b) full null beam width
c) beam area
d) directivity
b
2. If the HPBW is 30° then FNBW is approximately _____
a) 60°
b) 30°
c) 15°
d) 20°
a
3. Total beam area is sum of major and minor lobe areas.
a) True
b) False
a
ΩA = ΩM+Ωm
4. If beam efficiency is 0.87 then the stray factor is ____
a) 1.87
b) 0.13
c) 1.30
d) 0.87
b
Given beam efficiency ∈B=0.87
∈B+∈s = 1
∈s = 1-0.87 = 0.13
5. If the antennas revolution time is 10 sec and 3 dB beam width duration is 150ms then the antenna beam width is _______
a) 5.4°
b) 54°
c) 15°
d) 1.5°
a
6. Relation between beam efficiency and stray factor is given by ____
a) ∈B+∈s=1
b) ∈B-∈s=1
c) \(\frac{\in_B}{\in_s}=1\) 
d) ∈B+∈s=2
a
\(\in_B=\frac{\Omega_M}{\Omega_A}, \in_s = \frac{\Omega_m}{\Omega_A}\) 
∈B+∈s=1
