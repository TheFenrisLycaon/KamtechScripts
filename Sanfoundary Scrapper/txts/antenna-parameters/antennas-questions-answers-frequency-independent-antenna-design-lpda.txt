1. What is the ratio of maximum frequency to minimum frequency if the scaling factor is 0.5 for 5 elements LPDA?
a) 16
b) 2
c) 4
d) 8
a
\(\frac{f_{max}}{f_{min}} = \frac{1}{τ^{N-1}} \) 
\(\frac{f_{max}}{f_{min}} =\frac{1}{τ^{N-1}} =\frac{1}{(0.5)^{5-1}}=2^4=16. \)
2. The value of periodicity factor in LPDA is _____
a) < 1
b) >1
c) ≥1
d) =0
a
3. The longest and shortest dipole lengths are taken in the form of the wavelength of the operating frequencies in LPDA.
a) True
b) False
a
4. The relation between the spacing factor σ and the scaling factor τ is given by ____
a) \(σ=tan^{-1}(\frac{1-τ}{4σ}) \) 
b) \(σ=tan^{-1}(\frac{1-τ}{2σ}) \) 
c) \(σ=tan^{-1}⁡(\frac{4σ}{1-τ}) \) 
d) \(σ=tan^{-1}⁡(\frac{2σ}{1-τ}) \)
