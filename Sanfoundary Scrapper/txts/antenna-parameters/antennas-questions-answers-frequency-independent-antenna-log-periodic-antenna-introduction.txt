1. Frequency range of LPDA is ________
a) 3 MHz to 30 MHz
b) 30 KHz to 30 GHz
c) 30 MHz to 3 GHz
d) 300 KHz to 300GHz
c
MF – Medium Frequency – 300-3000 KHz
HF – High Frequency – 3-30 MHz
VHF – Very high frequency – 30-300 MHz
UHF – Ultra high frequency – 300MHz to 3GHz
So it uses VHF and UHF.
2. Which of the following band of frequency the LPDA operates?
a) VHF & UHF
b) UHF & MF
c) MF & HF
d) HF & UHF
a
MF and UHF – 300 kHz to 3GHz
MF and HF – 300 kHz to 30MHz
HF and UHF – 3MHz to 3GHz
LPDA operates at 30MHz to 3GHz frequency range.
3. In frequency independent antennas, the antennas are defined in terms of _________
a) Angles
b) Wavelengths
c) Range
d) Frequency
a
4. The relation between the dipole lengths and the scaling factor τ in LPDA is given by _________
a) \(\frac{L_N}{L_{N+1}} =τ\) 
b) \(\frac{L_N}{L_{N+1}} =\frac{1}{τ} \) 
c) \(\frac{L_N}{L_{N+2}} =τ\) 
d) \(\frac{L_{N+2}}{L_N} =τ\)

5. Which of the following statement is false?
a) LPDA is a frequency independent antenna
b) In LPDA the lengths of the dipoles increases from the apex of the feed line toward other end

c) \(\frac{S_N}{S_{N+2}} = τ\) 
d) \(\frac{S_{N+2}}{S_N} = τ\) 
a
8. Which of the following expression is correct?
a) \(\frac{L_N}{L_{N+1}} = \frac{S_N}{S_{N+1}} = τ\) 
b) \(\frac{L_N}{L_{N+1}} = \frac{S_{N+1}}{S_N} = τ\) 
c) \(\frac{L_N}{L_{N+1}} = \frac{S_{N+1}}{S_N} = \frac{1}{τ} \) 
d) \(\frac{L_N}{L_{N+1}} = \frac{S_N}{S_{N+1}} = \frac{1}{τ} \)
