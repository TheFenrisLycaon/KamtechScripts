1. Which of the following is a narrow band antenna?
a) Rhombic antenna
b) Yagi-Uda antenna
c) Log periodic antenna
d) Horn antenna
b
2. Log periodic antenna uses which range of frequencies?
a) VHF and UHF
b) VHF and SHF
c) MF and VHF
d) HF and VHF
a
MF – Medium Frequency – 300-3000 KHz
HF – High Frequency – 3-30 MHz
VHF – Very high frequency – 30-300 MHz
UHF – Ultra high frequency – 300MHz to 3GHz
So it uses VHF and UHF.
3. Log periodic antenna is frequency dependent.
a) True
b) False
b
4. Which of the following antenna is known as Frequency Independent antenna?
a) LPDA
b) Dipole antenna
c) Rhombic antenna
d) Yagi-Uda antenna
a
5. What is the approximate gain of LPDA for best performance?
a) 1 dB to 5 dB
b) 4 dB to 18 dB
c) 8 dB to 20 dB
d) 7 dB to 12 dB
d
6. In order to get more number of channels in TV reception, we prefer Yagi-Uda than LPDA.
a) True
b) False
b
7. Which of the following statements is false?
a) Log periodic antenna is a broadband antenna
b) The active region doesn’t change with the change in frequency in Log Periodic antenna
c) The geometry structure of the dipole changes proportional to the wavelength in LPDA
d) Impedance is function of logarithmic of frequency
b
8. Which of the following best suits to describe the impedance of a log periodic antenna?
a) It is function of anti-logarithmic of frequency
b) It is dependent on frequency directly
c) It is a function of logarithmic of inverse frequency
d) It is a function of logarithmic of frequency
d
9. The geometrical design of the Log periodic depends on _____
a) Scaling factor
b) Gain
c) Impedance
d) Stability
a
Scaling factor = \(\frac{r_n}{r_{n+1}}\)
