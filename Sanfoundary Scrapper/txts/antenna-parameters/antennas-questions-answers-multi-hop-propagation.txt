1. The propagation of wave from transmitter to receiver without touching the ground is called as ___
a) Single hop distance
b) Virtual height
c) Actual height
d) Multi-hop
a
2. The propagation of wave from transmitter to receiver by touching ground in between them and goes through different layers is called _____
a) Multi-hop single layer
b) Single hop multi layer
c) Multi hop multi layer
d) Single hop single layer
c
3. The take-off angle for the curved earth surface is given by ____
a) β = 90 – θi – 57.3d/2R
b) β = 180 – θi
c) β = 180 – θi – 57.3d/2R
d) β = 90 – θi
a
Take-off angle for the flat earth surface is β = 90 – θi
4. Calculate the skip distance for the flat earth when a wave is reflected in an ionosphere at a height of 100km at a take-off angle 10°.
a) 172km
b) 35.26km
c) 17.25km
d) 35.26m
b
θi=90-β=90-10=80
skip distance \(d=2h\sqrt{[(secθ_i)^2-1]}=2h\sqrt{[(sec10)^2-1]}=35.26km \)

d) 75
a
6. Which of the following propagation is used when the receiver is beyond the skip distance?
a) Single hop
b) Single hop multi layer
