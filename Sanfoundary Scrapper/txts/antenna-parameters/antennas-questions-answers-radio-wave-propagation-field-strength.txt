d
3. The field strength of the wave at a unit distance from transmitting antenna depends on _____
a) only the power radiated by the transmitting antenna
b) only on the power received by the receiving antenna
c) only on directivity of antenna in vertical and horizontal planes
d) both on the power radiated by the transmitting antenna & directivity in vertical and horizontal planes
d
4. What is the condition of roughness of earth for earth to be electrically smooth?
a) R < 0.1
b) R > 10
c) R > 0.1
d) R > 1
a
If the roughness of earth R < 0.1, then it is electrically smooth.
If the roughness of earth R > 10, then it is electrically rough.
5. Power density of the receiving antenna is given by _________
