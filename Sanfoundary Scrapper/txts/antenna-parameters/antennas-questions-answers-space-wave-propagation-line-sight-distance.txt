1. Which of the following statement is defined as line of sight distance?
a) Distance covered by a direct space wave from transmitting to receiving antenna
b) Distance covered by an indirect space wave from transmitting to receiving antenna
c) Distance covered by a direct sky wave from transmitting to receiving antenna
d) Distance covered by an indirect sky wave from transmitting to receiving antenna
a
2. On which of the following factors does the LOS distance depends?
a) Height of receiving antenna alone
b) Height of transmitting antenna alone
c) Only on height of transmitting and receiving antenna
d) On height of transmitting and receiving antenna and effective earths radius factor k
d
3. Which of the following order is correct?
a) LOS > Radio horizon > Optical horizon
b) Radio horizon < LOS < Optical horizon
c) Radio horizon > Optical horizon > LOS
d) Optical horizon > Radio horizon > LOS
a
4. Expression for the LOS distance is _____ (km)
a) \(4.12(\sqrt{h_t}+\sqrt{h_r})\) 
b) \(4.12(\sqrt{h_t}-\sqrt{h_r})\) 
c) \(3.56(\sqrt{h_t}+\sqrt{h_r})\) 
d) \(3.56(\sqrt{h_t}-\sqrt{h_r})\) 
a
Expression for the Radio horizon distance is \(d =3.56(\sqrt{h_t}+\sqrt{h_r})\) in km.
5. Expression for radio horizon in km is ____
a) \(4.12(\sqrt{h_t}+\sqrt{h_r})\) 
b) \(4.12(\sqrt{h_t}-\sqrt{h_r})\) 
c) \(3.56(\sqrt{h_t}+\sqrt{h_r})\) 
d) \(3.56(\sqrt{h_t}-\sqrt{h_r})\) 
c
Expression for the LOS distance is \(d = 4.12(\sqrt{h_t}+\sqrt{h_r})\) in km.
6. The value of k at which LOS equals to the radio horizon is ___
a) 1
b) 0
c) 3/4
d) -3/4
a
And re=k*6370km, k is the effective radius factor.
Expression for radio horizon in km is \(d = 3.56(\sqrt{h_t}+\sqrt{h_r}),\) LOS depends on k also so d = \(4.12(\sqrt{h_t}+\sqrt{h_r}).\) At k=1 both will be equal.
7. If the heights of transmitting and receiving antenna are equal then LOS distance is ___ in km.
a) 8.24√h
b) 4.82√h
c) 4.12√h
d) 2.06√h
a
Expression for the LOS distance is \(d = 4.12(\sqrt{h_t}+\sqrt{h_r})\) in km.
⇨	D=4.12 (2√h) = 8.24√h.
8. Radio horizon is less than LOS distance.
a) True
b) False
a
9. The radio horizon can be equal to the LOS distance if same height antennas are used.
a) True
b) False
b
10. What is the value of the effective radius factor k of earth if the radius of curvature and the earth radius equals?
a) 1
b) 0
c) Infinity
d) 4/3
c
\(k=\frac{1}{1-\frac{r_e}{r_c}}=\frac{1}{0}=∞.\)
