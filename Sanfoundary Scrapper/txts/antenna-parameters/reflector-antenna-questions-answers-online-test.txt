1. Which of the following wave conversion mechanism is performed in a parabolic reflector antenna?
a) Plane to spherical
b) Spherical to plane
c) Performs both plane to spherical and spherical to plane
d) Elliptic polarization
b
2. The power gain of the parabolic reflector with circular aperture of diameter 10λ?
a) 100π
b) 10π
c) 600π
d) 360π
c
\(G_p = 6\frac{d^2}{λ^2} = 600π.\) 
3. Find the aperture ratio of the paraboloid with aperture diameter 1m at 1.5GHz frequency?
a) 5
b) 0.2
c) 1.5
d) 7.5
a
\(λ=\frac{c}{f}=\frac{3×10^8}{1.5×10^9}=0.2m\) 
Aperture ratio\( = \frac{1}{0.2}=5.\) 
4. BWFN of a paraboloid antenna with circular aperture assuming feed is isotropic is ____
a) \(\frac{140λ}{d} \) 
b) \(\frac{115λ}{d} \) 
c) \(\frac{58λ}{d} \) 
d) \(\frac{40λ}{d} \) 
a
BWFN (Beam width between two first nulls) =  \(\frac{140λ}{d}, \) (d is diameter of circular aperture)
For a rectangular aperture \(BWFN =\frac{115λ}{L}, \) (L is length of rectangular aperture).
5. Find the BWFN of a paraboloid with a circular aperture of diameter 10λ?
a) 14 degrees
b) 28 degrees
c) 11.5 degrees
d) 41 degrees
a
BWFN (Beam width between two first nulls) = \(\frac{140λ}{d}, \) (d is diameter of circular aperture)
⇨	\(BWFN =\frac{140λ}{10λ}=14 degrees.\) 
6. What is the ratio of focal length to diameter for practical applications in a parabolic reflector?
a) 0.25 to 0.5
b) < 0.25
c) 0.125 to 0.3
d) 0.5 to 1
a
7. Which of the following is false regarding a paraboloid antenna?
a) Spill over decreases due to back lobe of primary radiator
b) Feed placed at the focus is used to improve the beam pattern
c) Pill box provides wide beam in one plane and narrow beam in other plane
d) At lower frequencies parabolic antennas are not used frequently
a
8. Which of the following paraboloid reflector is formed by cutting some part of paraboloid to meet requirements?
a) Truncated paraboloid
b) Cassegrain
c) Corner
d) Pill box
a
9. Which of the following is used to produce wide beam in one plane and narrow beam in other plane?
a) Pill box
b) Truncated paraboloid
c) Cassegrain
d) Paraboloid with rectangular aperture
a
10. In a paraboloid antenna, all rays leaving the focal point are collimated along the reflector’s axis after reflection.
a) True
b) False
a
⇨	All rays leaving the focal point are collimated along the reflector’s axis after reflection.
⇨	All overall ray path lengths (from the focal point to the reflector and on to the aperture plane) are the same and equal to 2F.
