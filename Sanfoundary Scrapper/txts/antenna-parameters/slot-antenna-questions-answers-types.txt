1. Which of the following type does the slot antenna belongs?
a) Aperture Type
b) Wire Type
c) Lens Type
d) Reflector Type
a
2. In which of the following band the slot antenna operates?
a) UHF and SHF
b) SHF and VLF
c) VLF and MF
d) UHF and EHF
a
VLF-3 KHz – 30 KHz
MF- 300 KHz – 3MHz
UHF- 300 MHz-3GHz
SHF- 3 GHz -30 GHz
EHF- 30GHz-300GHz
So slot antenna operates at UHF and SHF range.
3. Which of the following antenna is obtained by removing a small area of metal from an infinite ground plane?
a) Slot antenna
b) Plane reflector
c) Dipole
d) Yagi-Uda
a
4. What is the principle used in slot antennas?
a) Babinet’s principle
b) Archimedes principle
c) Geo-Optics
d) Image Theory
a
5. Microstrip slot antennas are complementary to the Microstrip dipole antennas
a) True
b) False
a
6. Which of the following slot antenna radiation can be modified electronically by tunable capacitor?
a) Annular slot antenna
b) Tapered slot antenna
c) Both annular and tapered
d) Neither annular nor tapered
a
7. Which of the following type of slot antenna gives good end-fire radiation?
a) Annular slot antenna
b) Tapered slot antenna
c) All slot antennas gives good end-fire radiation
d) None of slot antenna gives good end-fire radiation
b
8. What is the impedance of 2- element slot antenna with single slot antenna resistance =500Ω?
a) 125Ω
b) 500Ω
c) 1000Ω
d) 250Ω
a
Given N=2, Now \(Z_{in,N} = \frac{Z_{slot}}{N^2} = \frac{500}{4} = 125\Omega  \)
9. Which of the following cannot be used to reduce the radiation resistance in slot antenna for a given slot size?
a) Center feed
b) Off-center feed
c) Inclined slot
d) Stub tuning
a
10. The bi-directional radiation disadvantage in slot antenna can be rectified with metallic cavity
a) True
b) False
a
