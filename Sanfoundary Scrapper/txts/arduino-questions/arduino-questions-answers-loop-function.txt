int pin1=11;int x=3;void setup() {    pinMode(pin1,OUTPUT);}void loop() {    for(int i=x;i<6;i++) {        if(i%2==0) {            x=x+1;            loop();        }        else {            digitalWrite(pin1,HIGH);            digitalWrite(pin1,LOW);        }    }}
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
6. Can a programmer not use the loop function at all in a code?
a) Yes
b) No
c) Yes, but it needs to be called at least once
d) Yes, but it needs to be commented out
a
7. Can the loop() function be used to replace the functionality of the setup() function?
a) Yes, it can
b) No, it cannot
c) Yes, it can, but only for certain Arduino Boards
