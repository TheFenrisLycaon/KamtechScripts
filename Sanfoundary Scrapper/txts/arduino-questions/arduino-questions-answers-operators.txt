1. What is the output of the following program if ‘a’ and ‘b’ are both supplied with 5V?
int a=9;int b=10;void setup() {    Serial.begin(9600);    pinMode(a,INPUT);    pinMode(b,INPUT);}void loop() {    int x=digitalRead(a);    int y=digitalRead(b);    if(a!=b){        Serial.println(“Not Equal”);    }    else {        Serial.println(“Equal”);    }}
a) Equal
b) Not Equal
c) Runtime Error
d) Compilation Error
a
2. What is the difference between ternary operators and unary operators?
a) Ternary Operators work with 1 operand while unary operators work with 3 operands
b) Ternary Operators work with 3 operands while unary operators work with 1 operand
c) Ternary Operators work with 2 operands while unary operators work with 3 operands
d) Ternary Operators work with 4 operands while unary operators work with 1 operand
b
Eg:-
int a=10, b=20, c;c=(a<b)?a:b;
The above code will make c=10 since ‘a’ is lesser than ‘b’.
a++;
The above code will increment the value of ‘a’ by 1.
3. What will be the output of the following code?
void setup() {    Serial.begin(9600);}void loop() {    int a=92;    int b=101;    int c=a&b;    Serial.println(c);}
a) 100
b) 69
c) 68
d) 40
c
4. What is the output of the following code?
void setup() {    Serial.begin(9600);}void loop() {    int *pointer;    int val=100;    pointer=&val;    Serial.println(*pointer);}
a) 100
b) 2e444ad233
c) cc10091a2
d) a99102123
a
5. What is the name of the | operator?
a) Logical OR
b) Bitwise OR
c) Logical AND
d) Bitwise AND
b
6. What is the name of the ~ operator?
a) Bitwise NOT
b) Logical NOT
c) Bitwise SHIFT
d) Pointer Address
a
7. What is the name of the ^ operator?
a) Bitwise XNOR
b) Bitwise NAND
c) Bitwise XOR
d) Bitwise AND
c
8. What is the purpose of the << operator?
a) Bitwise AND
b) Bitwise Right Shift
c) Bitwise Left Shift
d) Bitwise OR
c
9. Is there a difference between the = and the == operators?
a) Yes
b) No
a
10. How many operands does the >= operator require?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
