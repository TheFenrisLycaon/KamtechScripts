1. What is the #include Preprocessor Directive used for?
a) For getting operating system information
b) For performing read/write operations
c) For importing header files or other codes into the existing code
d) For compiling the written code
c
2. Check the validity of the two statements derived from the two lines of code supplied below.
#include<file.h>
#include “file.h”
i. #include<file.h> makes the preprocessor check for file.h only in directories specified by the IDE/Compiler.
ii. #include “file.h” makes the preprocessor check for file.h in the directory specified within the double quotes.
iii. Both the lines of code are the same.
a) Statements i, ii and iii are all false
b) Only Statement iii is false
c) Statements ii and iii are true
d) Only statement i is true
b
