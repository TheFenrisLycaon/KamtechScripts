1. In C++ what type of operator is a cast operator?
a) Unary
b) Binary
c) Ternary
d) Quaternary
a
void setup() {
    float f=34.5;
    int i = static_cast<int>(f);
}
The code above results in the variable ‘i’ having a value of 34 stored in it.
2. What is Type Casting?
a) Converting a file from one type to another
b) Creating new arrays
c) Deleting the variable from memory
d) Converting a variable from one type to another
d
3. Who carries out implicit type casting?
a) The programmer
b) The assembler
c) The compiler
d) The microcontroller
c
4. Who initiates explicit type casting?
a) The programmer
b) The compiler
c) The microcontroller
d) The assembler
a
5. What is the output of the given code?
void setup() {
    double x=11.3;
    int s=(int)x+12;
    Serial.begin(9600);
    Serial.print(s);
}
void loop() {
    //Do nothing.
}
a) 12.2
b) 23.3
c) null
d) 23
d
6. What is the conversion type for reinterpret casting?
a) Pointer to Variable
b) Variable to Variable
c) Pointer to Pointer
d) Variable to Pointer
c
7. What is the output of the following code?

{
    Serial.print(x);
}
void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(9600);
    const char *x=”Hello”;
    print(const<char *>(x));
    return 0;
}
a) Hello
b) H
c) Ello
d) null
a
8. What is the use of the typeid() function?
a) To find the datatype of the variable
b) To find the “const” status of the variable
c) To find the address of the variable
d) To find the value of the variable
a

short x = 200;int b = (int) a;int c = int (a);
a) Lines 1 and 2 are incorrect
b) Lines 2 and 3 are incorrect
c) Only line 1 is incorrect
d) No lines are incorrect
d
10. Is there any difference between the usage of the size() and the length() function?
