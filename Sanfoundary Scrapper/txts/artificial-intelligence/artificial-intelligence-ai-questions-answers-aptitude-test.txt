d) All of the mentioned
d
2. A* algorithm is based on ___________

b) Depth-First –Search
c) Best-First-Search
d) Hill climbing
c
3. The search strategy the uses a problem specific knowledge is known as ___________

6. Best-First search can be implemented using the following data structure.
a) Queue
b) Stack
c) Priority Queue
d) Circular Queue
c
7. The name “best-first search” is a venerable but inaccurate one. After all, if we could really expand the best node first, it would not be a search at all; it would be a straight march to the goal. All we can do is choose the node that appears to be best according to the evaluation function.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Heuristic function h(n) is ________
a) Lowest path cost
b) Cheapest path from root to goal node
c) Estimated cost of cheapest path from root to goal node
d) Average path cost
c
9. Greedy search strategy chooses the node for expansion in ___________
a) Shallowest
b) Deepest
c) The one closest to the goal node
d) Minimum heuristic cost
c
10. What is the evaluation function in greedy approach?
a) Heuristic function
b) Path cost from start node to current node
c) Path cost from start node to current node + Heuristic cost
d) Average of Path cost from start node to current node and Heuristic cost
a
11. What is the space complexity of Greedy search?
a) O(b)
b) O(bl)
c) O(m)
d) O(bm)
d
12. What is the evaluation function in A* approach?
a) Heuristic function
b) Path cost from start node to current node
c) Path cost from start node to current node + Heuristic cost
d) Average of Path cost from start node to current node and Heuristic cost
c
13. A* is optimal if h(n) is an admissible heuristic-that is, provided that h(n) never underestimates the cost to reach the goal.
a) True
b) False
a
