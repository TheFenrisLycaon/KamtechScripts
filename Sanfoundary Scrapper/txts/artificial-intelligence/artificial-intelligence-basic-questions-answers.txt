1. _________________ are mathematical problems defined as a set of objects whose state must satisfy a number of constraints or limitations.
a) Constraints Satisfaction Problems
b) Uninformed Search Problems
c) Local Search Problems
d) All of the mentioned
a
2. Which of the Following problems can be modeled as CSP?
a) 8-Puzzle problem
b) 8-Queen problem
c) Map coloring problem
d) All of the mentioned
d
3. What among the following constitutes to the incremental formulation of CSP?
a) Path cost
b) Goal cost
c) Successor function
d) All of the mentioned
d
Successor function: A value can be assigned to any unassigned variable, provided it does not conflict with previously assigned variables.
Goal test: The current assignment is complete.
Path cost: A constant cost (e.g., 1) for every step.
4. The term ___________ is used for a depth-first search that chooses values for one variable at a time and returns when a variable has no legal values left to assign.
a) Forward search
b) Backtrack search
c) Hill algorithm
d) Reverse-Down-Hill search
b
5. To overcome the need to backtrack in constraint satisfaction problem can be eliminated by ____________
a) Forward Searching
b) Constraint Propagation
c) Backtrack after a forward search
d) Omitting the constraints and focusing only on goals
a
6. The BACKTRACKING-SEARCH algorithm in Figure 5.3 has a very simple policy for what to do when a branch of the search fails: back up to the preceding variable and try a different value for it. This is called chronological-backtracking. It is also possible to go all the way to set of variable that caused failure.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Consider a problem of preparing a schedule for a class of student. What type of problem is this?
