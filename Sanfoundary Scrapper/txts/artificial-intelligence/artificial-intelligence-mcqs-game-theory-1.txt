1. General games involves ____________
a) Single-agent
b) Multi-agent
c) Neither Single-agent nor Multi-agent
d) Only Single-agent and Multi-agent
d
2. Adversarial search problems uses ____________
a) Competitive Environment
b) Cooperative Environment
c) Neither Competitive nor Cooperative Environment
d) Only Competitive and Cooperative Environment
a
3. Mathematical game theory, a branch of economics, views any multi-agent environment as a game provided that the impact of each agent on the others is “significant,” regardless of whether the agents are cooperative or competitive.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Zero sum games are the one in which there are two agents whose actions must alternate and in which the utility values at the end of the game are always the same.
a) True
b) False
b
5. Zero sum game has to be a ______ game.
a) Single player
b) Two player
c) Multiplayer
d) Three player
c
6. A game can be formally defined as a kind of search problem with the following components.
a) Initial State
b) Successor Function
c) Terminal Test
d) All of the mentioned
d
7. The initial state and the legal moves for each side define the __________ for the game.
a) Search Tree
b) Game Tree
c) State Space Search
d) Forest
b
8. General algorithm applied on game tree for making decision of win/lose is ____________
a) DFS/BFS Search Algorithms
b) Heuristic Search Algorithms
c) Greedy Search Algorithms
d) MIN/MAX Algorithms
d
9. The minimax algorithm computes the minimax decision from the current state. It uses a simple recursive computation of the minimax values of each successor state, directly implementing the defining equations. The recursion proceeds all the way down to the leaves of the tree, and then the minimax values are backed up through the tree as the recursion unwinds.
a) True

a

b) Space – bm and time – bm
c) Time – bm and space – bm
d) Same as BFS
