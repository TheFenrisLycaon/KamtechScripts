1. A 3-input neuron is trained to output a zero when the input is 110 and a one when the input is 111. After generalization, the output will be zero when and only when the input is?
a) 000 or 110 or 011 or 101
b) 010 or 100 or 110 or 101
c) 000 or 010 or 110 or 100
d) 100 or 111 or 101 or 001
c

Inputs	Output
000	$
001	$
010	$
011	$
100	$
101	$
110	0
111	1
where $ represents don’t know cases and the output is random.
After generalization, the truth table becomes:

Inputs	Output
000	0
001	1
010	0
011	1
100	0
101	1
110	0
111	1
