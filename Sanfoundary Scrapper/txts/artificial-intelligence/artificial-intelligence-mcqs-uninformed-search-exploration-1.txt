b) O(b2) and O(d2)
c) O(d2) and O(b2)
d) O(d2) and O(d2)

7. Breadth-first search is not optimal when all step costs are equal, because it always expands the shallowest unexpanded node.
a) True
b) False
b
8. uniform-cost search expands the node n with the __________
a) Lowest path cost
b) Heuristic cost
c) Highest path cost
d) Average path cost
a
9. Depth-first search always expands the ______ node in the current fringe of the search tree.
a) Shallowest
b) Child node
c) Deepest
d) Minimum cost
c
10. Breadth-first search always expands the ______ node in the current fringe of the search tree.
a) Shallowest
b) Child node
c) Deepest
d) Minimum cost
a
11. Optimality of BFS is ___________
a) When there is less number of nodes
b) When all step costs are equal
c) When all step costs are unequal
d) None of the mentioned
b
12. LIFO is ______ where as FIFO is ________
a) Stack, Queue
b) Queue, Stack

13. When the environment of an agent is partially observable in search space following problem/problems could occur.
a) Sensorless problems: If the agent has no sensors at all, then (as far as it knows) it could be in one of several possible initial states, and each action might therefore lead to one of several possible successor states
b) Contingency problems: If the environment is partially observable or if actions are uncertain, then the agent’s percepts provide new information after each action. Each possible percept defines a contingency that must be planned for. A problem is called adversarial if the uncertainty is caused by the actions of another agent
c) Exploration problems: When the states and actions of the environment are unknown, the agent must act to discover them. Exploration problems can be viewed as an extreme case of contingency problems
d) All of the mentioned
d
14. For general graph, how one can get rid of repeated states?

a) Space, Time
b) Time, Space
c) Time, Time
d) Space, Space
a
16. The main idea of Bidirectional search is to reduce the time complexity by searching two way simultaneously from start node and another from goal node.
a) True
b) False
