1. Suppose A->xBz and B->y, then the simplified grammar would be:
a) A->xyz
b) A->xBz|xyz
c) A->xBz|B|y
d) none of the mentioned
a
We get A->xBz|xyz and now, as B has no production, we eliminate the terms which hold the variable B, thus the answer remain A->xyz.
2. Given Grammar: S->A, A->aA, A->e, B->bA
Which among the following productions are Useless productions?
a) S->A
b) A->aA
c) A->e
d) B->bA
d
3. Given:
S->…->xAy->…->w
if ____________, then A is useful, else useless symbol.
a) A is a non terminal
b) A is a terminal
c) w Î L
d) w Ë L
c
4. Given:
S->aSb
S->e
S-> A
A->aA
B->C
C->D
The ratio of number of useless variables to number of useless production is:
a) 1
b) 3/4
c) 2/3
d) 0
a
5. Given grammar G:
S->aS|A|C
A->a
B->aa
C->aCb
Find the set of variables thet can produce strings only with the set of terminals.
a) {C}
b) {A,B}
c) {A,B,S}
d) None of the mentioned
c
             Second step: Modify the set with variables that produce the elements of above
                          generated set.
The rest variables are termed as useless.
6. Given grammar:
S->aS|A
A->a
B->aa
Find the number of variables reachable from the Starting Variable?
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) None of the mentioned
b
7. Inorder to simplify a context free grammar, we can skip the following operation:
a) Removal of null production
b) Removal of useless symbols
c) Removal of unit productions
d) None of the mentioned
d
8.  Given a Grammar G:
S->aA
A->a
A->B
B->A
B->bb
Which among the following will be the simplified grammar?
a) S->aA|aB, A->a, B->bb
b) S->aA|aB, A->B, B->bb
c) S->aA|aB, A->a, B->A
d) None of the emntioned
a
                     Step 2: Remove B->B
                     Step 3: Substitute B->A
                     Step 4: Remove Repeated productions
9. Simplify the given grammar:
A-> a| aaA| abBc
B-> abba| b
a) A-> a| aaA| ababbAc| abbc
b) A-> a| aaA| ababbAc| abbc, B-> abba|b
c) A-> a| aaA| abbc, B->abba
d) None of the mentioned
a
10. In context to the process of removing useless symbols, which of the following is correct?
a) We remove the Nullable variables
b) We eliminate the unit productions
c) We eliminate products which yield no terminals
d) All of the mentioned
c
