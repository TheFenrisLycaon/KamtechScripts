c) Proof by induction
d) None of the mentioned
a
2. The language of balanced paranthesis is
a) regular
b) non regular
c) may be regular
d) none of the mentioned
b
3. State true or false:
Statement: Pumping lemma gives a necessary but not sufficient condition for a language to be regular.
a) true
b) false
a
4. Which of the following is/are an example of pigeon hole principle?
a) Softball team
b) Sock picking
c) Hair counting
d) All of the mentioned
d
Example: The softball team: Suppose 7 people who want to play softball(n=7 items), with a limitation of only 4 softball teams to choose from. The pigeonhole principle tells us that they cannot all play for different teams; there must be atleast one team featuring atleast two of the seven players.

b) Computer Science
c) Quantum Mechanics
d) None of the mentioned
c
8. Which of the following is not an application of Pumping Lemma?
a) {0i1i|i>=0}
b) {0ix|i>=0, x∈{0, 1}* and |x|<=i}
c) {0n| n is prime}
d) None of the mentioned
d
