1. What kind of expressions do we used for pattern matching?
a) Regular Expression
b) Rational Expression
c) Regular & Rational Expression
d) None of the mentioned
c
2. Which of the following do Regexps do not find their use in?
a) search engines
b) word processors
c) sed
d) none of the mentioned
d
3. Which of the following languages have built in regexps support?
a) Perl
b) Java
c) Python
d) C++
a
4. The following is/are an approach to process a regexp:
a) Contruction of NFA and subsequently, a DFA.
b) Thompson’s Contruction Algorithm
c) Both (a) and (b)
d) None of the mentioned
c
5. Are the given two patterns equivalent?
(1) gray|grey
(2) gr(a|e)y
a) yes
b) no
a
6. Which of the following are not quantifiers?
a) Kleene plus +
b) Kleene star *
c) Question mark ?
d) None of the mentioned
d
7. Which of the following cannot be used to decide whether and how a given regexp matches a string:
a) NFA to DFA
b) Lazy DFA algorithm
c) Backtracking
d) None of the mentioned
d
8. What does the following segment of code output?
$string1 = "Hello World\n";
if ($string1 =~ m/(H..).(l..)/) {
  print "We matched '$1' and '$2'.\n";
}
a) We matched ‘Hel’ and ‘ld’
b) We matched ‘Hel’ and ‘lld’
c) We matched ‘Hel’ and ‘lo ‘
d) None of the mentioned
c
When we use pattern in parenthesis, we can use any of ‘$1’, ‘$2’ later to refer to the previously matched pattern.
9. Given segment of code:
$string1 = "Hello\nWorld\n";
if ($string1 =~ m/d\n\z/) {
  print "$string1 is a string ";
  print "that ends with 'd\\n'.\n";
}
What does the symbol /z does?
a) changes line
b) matches the beginning of a string
c) matches the end of a string
d) none of the mentioned
c
Hello
World
 is a string that ends with ‘d\n’
10. Conversion of a regular expression into its corresponding NFA :
a) Thompson’s Construction Algorithm
b) Powerset Construction
c) Kleene’s algorithm
d) None of the mentioned
a
