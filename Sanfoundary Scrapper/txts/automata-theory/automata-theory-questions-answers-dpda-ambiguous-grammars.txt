1. CFGs are more powerful than:
a) DFA
b) NDFA
c) Mealy Machine
d) All of the mentioned
d
Context-free grammars are strictly more powerful than regular expressions:
1) Any language that can be generated using regular expressions can be generated by a context-free grammar.
2) There are languages that can be generated by a context-free grammar that cannot be generated by any regular expression.
As a corollary, CFGs are strictly more powerful than DFAs and NDFAs.
2. State true or false:
S-> 0S1|01
Statement: No regular expression exists for the given grammar.
a) true
b) false
a
3. For the given set of code, the grammar representing real numbers in Pascal has error in one of the six lines. Fetch the error.
 (1) ->    
 (2) ->   | epsilon
 (3) ->    | epsilon
 (4) -> ‘E’    | epsilon
 (5) -> + | – | epsilon
 (6) -> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
a) 3
b) 4
c) 2
d) No errors
a
 –>    
 –>   | epsilon
 –> ‘.’   | epsilon
 –> ‘E’    | epsilon
 –> + | – | epsilon
 –> 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
4. Which among the following is incorrect with reference to a derivation tree?
a) Every vertex has a label which is a terminal or a variable.
b) The root has a label which can be a terminal.
c) The label of the internal vertex is a variable.
d) None of the mentioned
b
5. Let G=(V, T, P, S)
where a production can be written as:
S->aAS|a
A->SbA|ba|SS
Which of the following string is produced by the grammar?
a) aabbaab
b) aabbaa
c) baabab
d) None of the mentioned
b
 aAS->aSbaA->aabAS->aabbaa
6. Statement 1: Ambiguity is the property of grammar but not the language.

c) Both the statements are true
d) Both the statements are false
c
7. Which of the following are non essential while simplifying a grammar?
a) Removal of useless symbols
b) Removal of unit productions
c) Removal of null production
d) None of the mentioned
d
a) Removal of useless symbols(non terminal) b) Removal of Unit productions and c) Removal of Null productions.
8. Which of the following are context free language?
a) L={aibi|i>=0}
b) L={wwr| w is a string and r represents reverse}
c) Both (a) and (b)
d) one of the mentioned
a
