a
2. The variable which produces an epsilon is called:
a) empty variable
b) nullable
c) terminal
d) all of the mentioned
b
3. Statement:

State true or false:
a) true
b) false
b
4. Simplify the given grammar:
S->aXb
X->aXb | e
a) S->aXb | ab, X-> aXb | ab
b) S->X | ab, X-> aXb | ab
c) S->aXb | ab, X-> S | ab
d) None of the mentioned
a
5. Consider the following grammar:
A->e
B->aAbC
B->bAbA
A->bB
The number of productions added on the removal of the nullable in the given grammar:
a) 3
b) 4
c) 2
d) 0
b
B->aAbC| abC
B->bAbA| bbA|  bAb| bb
A->bB
6. Let G=(V, T, P, S) be a CFG such that _____________. Then there exists an equivalent grammar G’ having no e productions.
a) e ∈ L(G)
b) w ∉ L(G)
c) e ∉ L(G)
d) w ∈ L(G)
c
7. For each production in P of the form:
A-> x1x2x3…xn
put into P’ that production as well as all those generated by replacing null variables with e in all possible combinations. If all x(i) are nullable,
a) A->e is put into P’
b) A->e is not put into P’
c) e is a member of G’
d) None of the mentioned
b
8. For the given grammar G:
S->ABaC
A->BC
B->b| e
C->D| e
D-> d
Remove the e productions and generate the number of productions from S in the modified or simplified grammar.
a) 6
b) 7
c) 5
d) 8
d
S->ABaC| AaC| ABa| Aa| a| aC| Ba| BaC
A->BC| B| C
B->b
C->D
D-> d
9. Consider G=({S,A,B,E}, {a,b,c},P,S), where P consists of S →AB, A →a, B →b and E →c.
Number of productions in P’ after removal of useless symbols:
a) 4
b) 3
c) 2
d) 5
a
P’= S->AB, A->a, B-> b,
V’={S, A, B},
∑’={a, b}
10. Given grammar G:
