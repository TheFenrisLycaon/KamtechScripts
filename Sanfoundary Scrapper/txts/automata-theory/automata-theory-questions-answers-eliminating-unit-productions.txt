a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) 3
c

5. If C is A-derivable, C->B is a production, and B ¹ A, then B is
a) nullable
b) Non-derivable
c) A-derivable
d) None of the mentioned
c
If A-> B is a production, B is called A- derivable.
If C is A-derivable, C->B is a production, and B ¹ A, then B is A -derivable.
No other variables are A-derivable.
6. A can be A-> derivable if and only if __________
a) A-> A is actually a production
b) A->B, B-> A exists
c) Both (a) and (b)
d) None of the mentioned
a
7. Given Grammar:

Fill in the blank:
a) T*V
b) T+V
c) R*T
d) R*V
d
T-> T+R| R*V| (T)| u
R->R*V|(T)| u
V-> (T)| u
