1. A finite automaton accepts which type of language:
a) Type 0
b) Type 1
c) Type 2
d) Type 3
d
2. Which among the following are incorrect regular identities?
a) εR=R
b) ε*=ε
c) Ф*=ε
d) RФ=R
d
3. Simplify the following regular expression:
ε+1*(011) *(1*(011) *) *
a) (1+011) *
b) (1*(011) *)
c) (1+(011) *) *
d) (1011) *
a
ε + RR*= ε + R*R= ε + R+= R*
4. P, O, R be regular expression over ∑, P is not ε, then
R=Q + RP has a unique solution:
a) Q*P
b) QP*
c) Q*P*
d) (P*O*) *
b
Let P and Q be regular expressions,
R=Q+RP
R=Q+(Q+RP) P
R=Q+((Q+RP) +RP) +P=Q+QP+RPP+RPP=Q+QP+(Q+RP) PP+(Q+RP) PP=Q+QP+QPP+RPPP+QPP+RPPP,
If we do this recursively, we get:
R= QP*
5. Arden’s theorem is true for:
a) More than one initial states
b) Null transitions
c) Non-null transitions
d) None of the mentioned
c
a) No null transitions in the transition diagrams
b) True for only single initial state
6. The difference between number of states with regular expression (a + b) and (a + b) * is:
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 0
a
7. In order to represent a regular expression, the first step to create the transition diagram is:
a) Create the NFA using Null moves
b)  Null moves are not acceptable, thus should not be used
c) Predict the number of states to be used in order to construct the Regular expression
d) None of the mentioned
a
a) Construct the NFA using null moves.
b) Remove the null transitions and convert it into its equivalent DFA.
8. (0+ε) (1+ε) represents
a) {0, 1, 01, ε}
b) {0, 1, ε}
c) {0, 1, 01 ,11, 00, 10, ε}
d) {0, 1}
a

a) 4
b) 3
c) 2
d) 5
a

a) Class
b) Power Set
c) Super Set
d) None of the mentioned
a
