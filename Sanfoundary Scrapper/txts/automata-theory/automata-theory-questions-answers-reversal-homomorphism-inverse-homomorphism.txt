1. If L is a language, the reversal of the language can be represented as:
a) L’
b) Lc
c) Lr
d) more than one option is correct
c
Example: L={0, 01, 100}
Lr={0, 10, 001}
2. If L is a regular language, ____ is also regular.
a) Lr
b) L’
c) L*
d) All of the mentioned
d
3. If E=F+G;
Er=?
a) Fr+Gr
b) (F+G)r
c) Both (a) and (b)
d) None of the mentioned
a
4. If E= FG, Er=?
a) FrGr
b) GrFr
c) Both (a) and (b)
d) None of the mentioned
b
5. Simplify the following identity:
E=01*+10*
ER=?
a) (1*0+0*1)
b) (01*10*)R
c) (0*1+10*)
d) All of the mentioned
a
ER=(01*)R+(10*)R=>(1*)R0R+(0*)R1R=>1*0+0*1
6. Which of the following obey the closure properties of Regular language?
a) Homomorphism
b) Inverse Homomorphism
c) Reversal
d) All of the mentioned
d
7. Let h(L) be a language of regular expression abe*+e(ab)*. Simplify the h(L)
a) (ab)*+eab*
b) abe*+ea*b*
c) (ab)*
d) None of the mentioned
:
abe*+e(ab)*(Using the identities e=e*, eE=Ee=E)
=ab+(ab)*=> ab will contain inside (ab)*, thus =>(ab)*.
8. Let h(0)=ab; h(1)=e
Let L={abab,baba}
h-1(L)=_______
a) the language of two one’s and any number of zeroes
b) the language of two zeroes and any number of one’s
c) the language of two zeroes and two one’s
d) none of the mentioned
b
9. While proving Inverse Homomorphism, which of the following steps are needed?
a) Start with a DFA Ain L
b) Construct a DFA B for h-1(L)
c) The set of states, initial and final states should be same.
d) All of the mentioned
d
a) The same set of states
b) The same start state
c) The same final state
d) Input alphabet = the symbols to which homomorphism h applies.
10. 8. Let h(0)=ab; h(1)=e
Let L={abab,baba}
h-1(L)= the language of two zeroes and any number of one’s.
The given example belongs to which of the following?
a) Homomorphism
b) Inverse Homomorphism
c) Both (a) and (b)
