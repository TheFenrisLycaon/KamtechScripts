a) Computer’s instruction set
b) A programming language
c) Cellular Automaton
d) All of the mentioned
d
2. Give a classic example of the concept of turing complete.
a) lambda calculus
b) C++
c) Lisp
d) All of the mentioned
d
3. Let two machines be P and Q. The state in which P can simulate Q and Q can simulate P is called:
a) Turing Equivalence
b) State Equivalence
c) Universal Turing Machine
d) None of the mentioned
a
4. Which of the following remarks the given statement?
Statement: Any function whose values can be computed by an algorithm, can be computed by a Turing machine.
a) Smn theorem
b) Structured Program theorem
c) Church-Turing thesis
d) None of the mentioned
c
Any function whose values can be computed by an algorithm, can be computed by a Turing machine. If any real world computer can be simulated by a turing machine, it is Turing equivalent to a Turing Machine.
5. Which of the following can be used to simulate any turing machine?
a) Finite State Automaton
b) Universal Turing Machine
c) Counter machines
d) All of the mentioned
b
6. State true or false:
Statement: Inorder to show something is Turing complete, it is enough to demonstrate that it can be used to simulate some Turing complete system.
a) true
b) false
a
7. Which of the following can lack in a Universal computer?
a) Turing Complete Instruction set
b) Infinite memory
c) Infinite time
d) None of the mentioned
d
8. Which among are not the results of computational theory?
a) In general, it is impossible to predict that what a Turing-complete program will do over an arbitrarily long time.
b) It is impossible to determine for every input, whether the program will eventually stop or continue forever.
c) It is not possible to determine whether a program will return true or false.
d) None of the mentioned
d
9. Which of the games fill under the category of Turing-complete?
a) Minecraft
b) Minesweeper
