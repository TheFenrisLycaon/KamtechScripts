a) To increase the pressure
b) To increase the speed of the engine
c) To increase the gear ratio
d) To increase the cooling rate
a
2. Which of the following is not the effect of supercharging?
a) Improved cold starting
b) Increased gas loading
c) Reduced exhaust smoke
d) Increased thermal loads
d

a) Turbocharger
b) Vane type supercharger
c) Root’s supercharger
d) Centrifugal type supercharger
a

6. How does the supercharger increase power output?
a) By increasing the charge pressure
b) By increasing the charge temperature
c) By increasing the speed of the engine
d) By increasing the quantity of fuel admitted
a
7. What is used to run the supercharging air compressor?
a) Separate electric motor
b) Engine
c) Exhaust gas turbine
d) Gear pump
b
8. Why is there a need for charge cooling?
a) To increase the engine operating temperature
b) To reduce the engine operating temperature
c) To decrease the density of air
d) To increase the exhaust temperature
a
9. What is the brake power if the swept volume is 3.5 liters, brake mean effective pressure is 10 bars, and speed is 6000 rpm?
a) 175 kW
b) 17.5 kW
c) 1.75 kW
d) 1750 kW
a
Brake power = \(\frac{brake \,mean \,effective \,pressure \,X \,swept \,volume \,X \,no.of \,cylinder \,X \,no.of \,power \,strokes}{60000} \) 
= \(\frac{3.5 × 10 × 10^5 × 6000}{1000 × 60000 × 2}\) = 175 kW.
10. The turbocharger makes use of the power from the engine so that it increases the pressure.
a) True
b) False
