b
                                                                                              m1= area ×length ×density
                                                                                              m1= A(1)(ρ)
                                                                                              m1= Aρ
6. Calculate the area of cross-section when the thickness of the web is 5mm?
a) 190mm2
b) 210mm
c) 275mm2
d) 198mm
c
                          = 11×52
                          = 275mm2
7. In the formula (Mb)max=mω2 \(r\frac{L}{9\sqrt{3}}\) what is the unit of r?
a) m
b) Km
c) mm
d) Cm
a
8. In the formula m=mlL, what is the unit of m?
a) g
b) Ton
c) m
d) Kg
d
9. Calculate the whipping stress when Mb=105.14Kn-mm, y=20mm, and I=143018.66mm4?
a)11.8N/mm2
b)13.79N/mm
c)14.7N/mm2
d)15.9N/mm
c
                         = \(\frac{105.14×10^3×20}{143018.66}\) 
                          = 14.7N/mm2
