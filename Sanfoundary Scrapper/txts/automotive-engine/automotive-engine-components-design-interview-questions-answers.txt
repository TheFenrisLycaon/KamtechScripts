1. An engine has a bore diameter of 160mm, what is the maximum number of studs in the engine?
a) 6
b) 7
c) 8
d) 9
c
 = 0.02×160+4
 = 7.2
7.2 studs can’t be taken so it is approximated to 8.
2. An engine has a bore diameter of 150mm, what is the minimum number of studs in the engine?
a) 6
b) 7
c) 8
d) 9
a
                                                                         = 0.01×150+4
                                                                         = 5.5
5.5 studs can’t be taken so it is approximated to 6.
3. Why studs are used?
a) To ensure the proper fixture of the crankshaft
b) To ensure the proper fixture of connecting rod
c) To ensure the proper fixture of the camshaft
d) To ensure the proper fixture of the cylinder assembly
d

6. Which of the following material is used in the manufacturing of studs?
a) Iron
b) Nickel
c) Steel
d) Titanium
c
7. What is the nominal diameter of studs when the core diameter of studs is 1.5mm?
a) 1.8m
b) 2.5mm
c) 1.8mm
d) 2.5m
c
                          d=\(\frac{d_c}{0.8}\) 
                          d=\(\frac{1.5}{0.8}\) 
                          d=1.87mm
8. What is the pitch of studs, when the diameter of studs is 6mm and the number of studs is 8?
a) 2.35mm
b) 1.80mm
c) 7.00mm
d) 4.95mm
a
                                               =\(\frac{\pi\times 6}{8}\) 
                                               =2.35mm
9. Find the pitch circle diameter of studs, given D=6 and d=4?
a) 16mm
b) 17mm
c) 18mm
d) 19mm
c
Dp=D+3d
                        =6+3×4
                        =18mm
10. Find the minimum pitch value of studs when d=1.5mm?
a) 23.27mm
b) 0.23mm
c) 2.32mm
d) 4.43mm
a
                                                   =23.27mm
11. Find the maximum pitch value of studs when d=1.5mm?
a) 15.78mm
b) 43.9mm
c) 14.87mm
d) 34.90mm
d
                                                    =28.5\(\sqrt{1.5}\) 
                                                    =34.90mm
12. Studs experience fluctuating load.
a) True
b) False
