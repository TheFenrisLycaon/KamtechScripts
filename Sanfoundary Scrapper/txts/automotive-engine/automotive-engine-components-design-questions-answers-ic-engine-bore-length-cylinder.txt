1. Piston diameter can be considered as the cylinder bore diameter.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Where is Indicated power generated?
a) In the crankshaft
b) In the alternator
c) Inside the engine cylinder
d) In the Fuel pump
c
3. The tachometer is used to measure the Indicated power.
a) True
b) False
b
4. In an engine running at 2200RPM has BP=35KW and FP=3KW, what is the value of IP?
a) 38KW
b) 38MW
c) 32KW
d) 32MW
a
       IP=35KW+3KW
                            =38KW
5. An engine has a mechanical efficiency of 80% with an IP of 35KW, calculate BP.
a) 28MW
b) 2.8W
c) 2.8GW
d) 28KW
d
BP=(0.8×35)
=28KW
6. In the formula IP=\(\frac{plAn}{60}\), what does ‘n’ represent?
a) RPM of the engine
b) Number of working strokes
c) Area of cylinder
d) Pressure
b
7. What is the Standard unit of Pm?
a) N/m3
b) N/mm2
c) KN/mm2
d) KN/m3
b
8. A 2-stroke engine has following specifications A=9852.3mm2, IP=4600, Pm=0.35Mpa, N=500RPM. Calculate the value of length.
a) 80mm
b) 80m
c) 0.8mm
d) 8m
a
                        4600=(0.35×l×9852.3×1000)/60
                                l=80mm
9. What is the standard unit of BP?
a) KW
b) W
c) MW
d) N/mm2
b
10. In the formula IP=\(\frac{plan}{60}\), In what scale l(length) has to be considered?
a) mm
