1. Where can we see the piston barrel in the piston?
a) Above the piston head
b) Below piston ring
c) Below the wrist pin
d) Below the piston head
d
2. Which of the mentioned below is the formula for calculating the thickness of the piston barrel at the top end?
a) t4=(0.03D+b+4.9)
b) t4=0.03D+b+6.9)
c) t3=(0.03D+b+4.9)
d) t3=0.03D+t4+4.9)
c
3. In the formula t3=(0.03D+b+4.9) what is the unit of b?
a) m
b) μm
c) mm
d) mm2
c
4. Calculate the thickness of the piston barrel at the top end, when D=80mm and b=7.5mm?
a) 14.8mm
b) 15.6mm
c) 13.7mm
d) 16.6mm
a
                           = (0.03×80+7.5+4.9)
                           = 14.8mm
5. Calculate the thickness of the piston barrel at the lower end when t3=13mm?
a) 4.5 to 5mm
b) 3.25 to 4.55mm
c) 5.6 to 7mm
d) 2.25 to 4.6mm
b
                          = (0.25×13) to (0.35×13)
                          = 3.25 to 4.55mm
6. Which type of piston rings are preferred in an engine?
a) Oversized rings
b) Undersized rings
c) Thin rings
d) Thick rings
c
7. What is the gap between the free ends of the ring before assembly when b=6mm?
a) 21 to 24mm
b) 20 to 23mm
c) 22 to 23mm
d) 21 to 25mm
a
                           = 3.5×6 to 4×6
                           = 21 to 24mm
8. What is the gap between the free ends of the ring after assembly when D=80mm?
a) 0.7 to 0.43mm
b) 0.11 to 0.25mm
c) 0.1 to 1.9mm
d) 0.16 to 0.32mm
d
                           = 0.002×80 to 0.004×80
                           = 0.16 to 0.32mm
9. Calculate the distance from the top of the piston to the first ring grove when th=7mm?
a) 8.5 to 10mm
b) 7.5 to 9mm
c) 7 to 8.4mm
d) 8 to 9.4mm
c
                            = 7 to 1.2×7
                            = 7 to 8.4mm
10. Calculate the width of the ring groove when h=5mm?
a) 3 to 5.8mm
b) 3.75 to 5mm
c) 4 to 5.9mm
d) 4.7 to 5.2mm
b
                             =0.75×5 to 5
                             = 3.75 to 5mm
