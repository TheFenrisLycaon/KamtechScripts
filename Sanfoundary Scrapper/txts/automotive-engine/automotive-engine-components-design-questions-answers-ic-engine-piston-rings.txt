d
2. What is the function of the compression ring?
a) To seal between piston and cams
b) To seal between cylinder and crank
c) To seal between cylinder and piston
d) To seal between crank and cams
c
3. What is the function of the oil ring?
a) To allow charge to the crankcase
b) To increase friction
c) To reduce the frictional losses
d) To compress charge
c
4. Piston rings are usually made of which material?
a) Cast iron
b) Nichrome
c) Tungsten
d) Silver
a
5. Usually how many piston rings are present in a petrol engine?
a) 1
b) 3 to 4
c) 7-10
d) 2
b
6. The compression rings have which cross-section?
a) Triangular cross-section
b) Circular cross-section
c) Rectangular cross-section
d) Square cross-section
c
7. In the formula b=D\(\sqrt{\frac{3P_w}{\sigma_t}}\), what is the unit of Pw?
a) N/mm2
b) N/m
c) KN/mm
d) N/m2
a
8. Find the range of axial thickness of the piston ring, when b=7.5mm?
a) 3.5 to 4mm
b) 4.6 to 3mm
c) 5.78 to 8.4mm
d) 5.25 to 7.5mm
d
= 0.7×7.5 to 7.5
= 5.25 to 7.5mm
9. Find the limit on the minimum axial thickness when D=150mm and Z=7?
a) 1.5mm
b) 3.7mm
c) 2.14mm
d) 4.87mm
c
                              = 150/(10×70)
                              = 2.14mm
10. Find the Radial width of the piston ring, when D=250mm, σt=100MPa, and pw=0.03N/mm2?
a) 5.5mm
b) 7.5mm
c) 4.5mm
d) 6.5mm
b
                          = 150\(\sqrt{\frac{3×0.03}{100}}\) 
                          = 7.5mm
