c) Side thrust=μ\((\frac{\pi D^2}{4})\)Pmax
d) Side thrust=μ\((\frac{\pi D^2}{4})\) 
a
5. In the formula Side thrust=μ\((\frac{\pi D^2}{4})\)Pmax what is the unit of Pmax?
a) N
b) N/mm2
c) N/m
d) N/mm
b
6. In the formula Side thrust=PbDLs what is the unit of ls?
a) Cm
b) Km
c) mm
d) m
c
7. Calculate the side thrust when μ=0.1, D=85mm and Pmax=4N/mm2?
a) 2269.8N/mm2
b) 100N/mm2
c) 3264N/mm2
d) 4563.4N/mm2
a
                                          =0.1×\((\frac{\pi\times 85^2}{4})\times 4\) 
                                          = 2269.8N/mm2
8. Calculate the stroke length when side thrust is 19634.95N/mm2, Pb=0.4N/mm2 and D=250mm?
a) 180.4mm
b) 143.4mm
c) 180.9mm
d) 196.3mm
d
                                19634=0.4×250×Ls
                                       Ls=196.3mm

a) 20 to 40mm
b) 35 to 70mm
c) 52 to 64mm
d) 43 to 57mm
c
                          =0.65×80 to 0.8×80
                          = 52 to 64mm
10. Calculate the empirical relationship for the length of the piston when D=80mm?
a) 60 t0 90mm
b) 80 to 120mm
c) 70 to 100mm
d) 90 to 110mm
b
                         = 80 to 1.5×80
                         = 80 to 120mm
