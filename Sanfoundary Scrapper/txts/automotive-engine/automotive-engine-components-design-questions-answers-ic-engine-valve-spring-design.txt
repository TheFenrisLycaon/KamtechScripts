b) Tappet
c) Roller
d) Cam
a
2. When valves are closed which pressure is built inside the cylinder?
a) Neutral pressure
b) Positive pressure
c) Negative pressure
d) Zero pressure
c
3. Calculate the mean coil diameter when C=8 and d=6?
a) 1.33mm
b) 48mm
c) 14mm
d) 2mm
b
                          = 8×6
                          = 48mm
4. Calculate the total number of turns for a square and ground end when N=13?
a) 15
b) 13
c) 32
d) 10
a
                            = 13+2
                           = 15
5. Calculate the free length of the spring when the solid length is 90mm and δmax=35.75mm?
a) 145.9mm
b) 69.65mm
c) 656mm
d) 131.11mm
d
=90+35.75+0.15(35.75)
                                               = 131.11mm

6. Calculate the solid length of the spring, when Nt=15mm and d=6mm.
a) 70mm
b) 90mm
c) 21mm
d) 9mm
b
                                            = 15×6
                                            = 90mm
7. Calculate the pitch of the coil when the free length is 131.11mm and N1 is 15mm?
a) 29.6mm
b) 9.37mm
c) 20mm
d) 12.3mm
b
                                              =\(\frac{131.11}{(15-1)}\) 
                                              = 9.37mm
