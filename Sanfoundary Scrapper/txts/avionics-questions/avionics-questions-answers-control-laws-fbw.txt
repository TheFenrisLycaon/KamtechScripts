1. What are control laws?
a) Algorithms relating pilots stick and control surface
b) Laws that govern aerodynamics forces
c) Laws that govern flight motion
d) Laws used to predict range and endurance
a
2. What is θi in pitch rate command law?
a) Tailplane demand angle
b) Pilot input angle
c) Gain in loop
d) Pitch rate gearing
b
 ηD = K(θi − Gqq)
 where ηD is the tailplane demand angle; θi is the pilot’s input command; q is the pitch rate; K is the forward loop gain, and Gq is the pitch rate gearing.
3. What is false true with respect to K in the pitch rate command law?
a) Value of K is infinite
b) Value of K is constant with height and altitude
c) Value of K changes with height and altitude
d) Value of k is constant with altitude and airspeed
d
4. Derivative of a control system provides _________
a) Low steady state error
b) Gain proportional to error
c) Reduced overshoot
d) Infinite gain
c
compensate for the lags in the system, for instance, actuator response, and hence improve the loop stability. This increases the damping of the aircraft response and reduces the overshoot to a minimum when responding to an input or disturbance. 
5. Integral of a control system provides __________
a) Low steady state error
b) Gain proportional to error
c) Reduced overshoot
d) infinite gain
a

6. Phase advance control is also known as __________
a) Proportional error controller
b) Derivative error controller
c) Integral error controller
d) One plus derivative error controller
d
The control term is filtered to limit the increase in gain at high frequencies and smooth the differentiation process which amplifies any noise present in the error signal.
7. What is the MTBF of a solid state rate gyro?
a) 1,000 to 5,000 hrs
b) 5,000 to 10,000 hrs
c) 10,000 to 50,000 hrs
d) 50,000 to 100,000 hrs
d
8. What are the shortcomings of using an angle of incidence indicator for feedback sensor?
a) Damage from bird strikes and local airflow disturbance
b) Damage from ice formation and local airflow disturbance
c) Ground and impact damage from landing
d) Works only in subsonic ranges
a
9. What is the angle of incidence limiting?
a) Warning indication to the pilot during high angles of incidence
b) The minimum angle of attack that can be measured
c) Keeping angle of incidence under safety limits whilst maneuvering
d) Reducing the error that occurs in an angle of incidence indicator
c
10. The aircraft is a rigid body.
a) True
b) False
b
11.  FCS sensors which sense aircraft motion also sense the structural deflections.
a) True
b) False
a
12. What happens to the phase lag in an actuator as the frequency is increased?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Constant
d) Cannot be determined
a
13. What can occur when the control valve travel limits are reached under conditions of large amplitude demands?
a) Stall
b) Structural damage
c) Rate limiting
d) Rate delimiting
c
14. What is PIO?
a) Pitot indicator
b) Pilot induced oscillations
c) Pressure indicator observed
d) Primary Input/Output
b

a) SISO
b) SIMO
c) MIMO
d) MISO
c
