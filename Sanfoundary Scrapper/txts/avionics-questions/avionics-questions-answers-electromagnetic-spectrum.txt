6. A signal travels a distance of 75 ft in the time it takes to complete 1 cycle. What is its frequency?
1 m 5 3.28 ft
a) 13Mhz
b) 13.12Mhz
c) 14Mhz
d) Cannot be determined
b
75/3.28=22.86m
Frequency= 300/22.86 =13.12Mhz.

a) 256.4Khz
b) 1477.8Khz
c) 1477.8Mhz
d) 256.7Mhz
c
Frequency = 300/0.203 = 1477.8Mhz.

a) Ground to ground communication
b) Satellite communication
c) Aircraft to ATC communication
d) Underwater communication
b
9. Which one of the following is not a source of infrared radiation?
a) Human bodies
b) Light bulbs
c) Sun
d) Books
d
10. Which one of the following is not a reason for not using X-rays in communication?
a) Highly attenuated
b) High power is required
c) Stopped by ionizing effects
d) Ionizing radiation
c
11. The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum occupied by a signal is called ________
a) Signal spectrum
b) Bandwidth
c) Frequency width
d) Signal strength
b
12. What is the bandwidth of a signal having 928Mhz and 902Mhz as its upper and lower frequencies?
a) 26Mhz
b) 26Hz
c) 1830Hz
d) 1830Mhz
a
13. What is the upper frequency of a signal with a bandwidth of 6Mhz, if the lower frequency limit is 54Mhz?
a) 60Mhz
b) 48Mhz
c) 60Hz
d) 48Hz
a
Upper frequency = bandwidth + lower frequency = 54Mhz + 6Mhz = 60Mhz.
14. Higher frequencies can have more channels for a particular bandwidth.
a) True
b) False
a
15. Which organization regulates international EM spectrum division?
a) ITU
b) FCC
c) NTIA
d) WCC
a
to discuss how the frequency spectrum is to be divided up and shared. Because many of the signals generated in the spectrum do not carry for long distances, countries can use these frequencies simultaneously without interference.
