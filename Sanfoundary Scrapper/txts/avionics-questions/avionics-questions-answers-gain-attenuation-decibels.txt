1. What is the component in which the output voltage is higher than the input voltage?
a) Attenuator
b) Amplifier
c) Differential
d) Multiplexer
b
2. What is the gain of the signal if output and input voltages are 700V and 50mV respectively?
a) 14000
b) 14
c) 71
d) 71400
a
3. What is the output signal voltage for a gain of 20 and input voltage of 20mV?
a) 400V
b) 4V
c) 400mV
d) 10V
c
Output signal amplitude = 20 x 0.02 = 400mV.
4. The power output of an amplifier is 7 watts. The power gain is 80. What is the input power?
a) 87.5mW
b) 87.5W
c) 13W
d) 13mW
a
                       Power in = power out / gain = 7/80 = 87.5mW.
5. What is the total gain of amplifiers with a power gain of 6, 8, 5 when connected in series?
a) 24
b) 20
c) 19
d) 240
d
6. A two-stage amplifier has an input power of 30μW and an output power of 1.5mW. One stage has a gain of 3. What is the gain of the second stage?
a) 20
b) 16.6
c) 40
d) 22.36
b
         Stage 2 gain = 50 / 3 = 16.6.
7. What should be the value of R2 to have an attenuation of 0.5, if R1=200Ω?
a) 100Ω
b) 300Ω
c) 200Ω
d) 500Ω
c
R2 = (0.5 X R2) + (0.5 X R1)
(0.5 X R2) = 100Ω
R2= 100/0.5 = 200Ω.
8. What should be the gain of an amplifier to have no voltage loss or gain?
a) 2
b) 1
c) 5
d) 0
b
9. What should be the gain of an amplifier to have zero voltage loss if the signal is already attenuated half that of the original signal?
a) 1/2
b) 1
c) 2
d) 0
c
10. What is the value of the total gain if A represent attenuation and G represent gain and all are cascaded?
A1=0.5		G1=5
A2=0.035	G2=20
a) 24.465
b)  99.9825
c) 25.535
d) 1.75
d
11. The unit decibel is a way of expressing the hearing response of the human ear.
a) True
b) False
a
12. What is the gain in decibels if the amplifier has an input of 3mV and output of 5V?
a) 54.4
b)  64
c) 64.4
d) 32
b
13. When a decibel value is computed by comparing a power value to 1 mW it is called as?
a) dBm
b) dBc
c) dB
d)  DB
a
