1. Which of the following is true with respect to Head up display?
a) View and assimilate the flight data with his head up in a transparent display
b) Assimilate the flight data without looking at any kind of display panel
c) View and assimilate the flight data that is projected on the helmet
d) Using a head up display a pilot and view and assimilate the flight data in all 360°
a
2. Which one of the following flight parameters are not present in a typical commercial head up display?
a) Airspeed
b) Altitude
c) Heading
d) Throttle position
d
3. The main reason for using a collimated display in HUD is ________
a) More information can be displayed
b) Wide view of display
c) Information displayed is focused at infinity
d) Fast screen refresh rates
c
4. What are the sensors used in combination with a raster mode HUD?
a) GPS
b) LIDAR
c) Radar and FLIR (Forward Looking InfraRed)
d) Microwave radar
c
5. Which of the following is the correct order for the path of light in a HUD?
a) CRT -> mirror -> collimating lens -> combiner glass -> pilot
b) CRT -> collimating lens -> mirror -> combiner glass -> pilot
c) CRT -> mirror -> combiner glass -> collimating lens -> pilot
d) Collimating lens -> CRT -> mirror -> combiner glass -> pilot
a
6. The Instantaneous FOV (Field Of Vision) changes with the position of view.
a) True
b) False
a
IFOV=2tan-1 D/2L, where a D= diameter of collimating lens and L=length of pilot’s eyes to the collimating lens. Clearly, as the position of view changes, L changes resulting in a change in IFOV.
7. What is the IFOV for a collimating lens of diameter 100mm, the distance between the collimating lens and combiner glass=50mm, the distance between pilot eyes and combiner glass=400mm?
a) 25.0°
b) 12.6°
c) 28.0°
d) 14.2°
b
IFOV = 2 x tan-1 (D/2L) =2 x tan-1( 100/2×450) = 12.6803° ≈ 12.6°
8. Which of the following are not controlled by the HUD processor?
a) Power supply to HUD
b) Brightness level and contrast level
c) Symbol and font generation
d) Computing flight parameters
d
9. What is the contrast ratio of real world image to the CRT display image?
a) 1:1
b) 4:1
c) 7:3
d) 2:1
c
10. What is the reason for using CRT used instead of LCD or LED displays?
a) To meet the required brightness level
b) Cheap to manufacture
c) Low energy of operation
d) Lightweight
a
