b) Frequency modulation
c) Continuous wave transmission
d) Discrete signal transmission
c
2. What device is used to prevent power from the transmitter from going to the receiver side?
a) Multiplexer
b) Duplexer
c) Monoplexer
d) Filter
b
3. What generates the final carrier frequency?
a) Oscillator
b) Modulator
c) Antenna
d) Power source
a
4. Frequency multiplier multiplies the frequency deviation produced by the modulator.
a) True
b) False
a
5. ______ is used to provide continuous tuning over the desired range?
a) Variable frequency oscillator
b) Frequency synthesizer
c) Variable Frequency producer
d) Frequency multiplier
a
6. What is the only oscillator capable of meeting the precision and stability demanded by the FCC?
a) Armstrong Oscillator
b) Crystal Oscillator
c) Hartley oscillator
d) RC Phase Shift Oscillator
b
7. The device that maintains controlled temperature for crystal oscillators are called __________
a) Crystal stove
b) Crystal ovens
c) Crystal chamber
d) Temperature chamber
b
8. What is the maximum frequency of a 16-MHz crystal with a stability of 200 ppm?
a) 1,60,03,200Hz
b) 2,14,65,400Hz
c) 1,36,12,500Hz
d) 4,56,42,863Hz
a
The maximum frequency is 1,60,00,000 + 3200 = 1,60,03,200 Hz.
9. Calculate the transmitter output frequency if the transmitter uses a crystal oscillator with a frequency of 14.9 MHz and a frequency multiplier chain with factors of 2, 3, and 3.
a) 1.564MHz
b) 268.2MHz
c) 264.3MHz
d) 265.6MHz
b
Transmitter output frequency = 14.9 MHz x 18 = 268.2 MHz.
10. Calculate the frequency for maximum drift of crystal if The crystal has a stability of 6300 ppm and an output frequency of 268.2MHz and frequency multiplier chain with factors of 2, 3, and 3.
a) 123.5MHz
b)  423.2MHz
c) 269.65MHz
d) 235.1MHz
c
This variation is multiplied by the frequency multiplier chain, yielding
0.03 percent x 18 =60.54 percent. Now, 268.2 MHz x 0.0054 = 1.45 MHz.
Thus, the frequency of the transmitter output is 268.2 + 1.45 MHz. The maximum frequency is
268.2 + 1.45 = 269.65 MHz.
11. What is the minimum frequency of a 16-MHz crystal with a stability of 200 ppm?
a) 1,60,03,200Hz
b) 2,14,65,400Hz
c) 1,59,96,800Hz
d) 4,56,42,863Hz
c
The maximum frequency is 16,000,000 – 3200 = 1,59,96,800 Hz.
