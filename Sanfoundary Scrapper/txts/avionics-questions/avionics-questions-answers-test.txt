1. A current carrying conductor is only called a transmission line if the length of the line is _____ long at the signal frequency?
a) 0.1λ
b) 0.3λ
c) 1.2λ
d) 1.5λ
a
2. Cables that carry RF signal are not ______
a) Capacitors equivalents
b) Inductors equivalents
c) Simple resistive conductors
d) Covered
c
3. For an operating frequency of 450 MHz, what length of a pair of conductors is considered to be a transmission line?
a) 0.754ft
b) 0.219ft
c) 0.35ft
d) 0.542ft
b
 λ = 984/450 = 2.19 ft
0.1λ = 2.19 x (0.1) = 0.219 ft.
4. Calculate the physical length of the transmission line for an operating frequency of 450MHz and 3⁄8λ long.
a) 0.45
b) 0.84
c) 0.82
d) 0.41
c
 (3/8)λ = 2.19(3)/8 = 0.82 ft.

b) N-type connector
c) SMA
d) BNC
d
8. Which type of coaxial cable connector is the least expensive?
a) PL-259
b) F-type connector

a) True
b) False
b
11. Parallel conductors form a distributed inductance with the insulation.
a) True
b) False
b
