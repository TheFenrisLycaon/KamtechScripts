1. What are FM and AM collectively referred together as?
a) Modulation
b) Angle modulation
c) Fast band modulation
d) Hi-fi Modulation
b
2. The value of a change in frequency of the carrier wave by the modulating signal is called as?
a) Maximum modulation frequency
b) Maximum carrier frequency
c) Frequency deviation
d) Modulating frequency deviation
c
3. The maximum shift in frequency is 3kHz and the minimum and maximum deviation in frequency of the actual signal are 149.97MHz and 150.03MHz. What is the carrier frequency?
a) 150MHz
b) 153MHz
c) 140MHz
d) 100Mhz
a
         Minimum deviation in frequency = carrier frequency – maximum shift in frequency
         Carrier frequency = Maximum deviation in frequency – maximum shift in frequency
         Carrier frequency = 150.03MHZ – 0.03MHz = 150MHz.   
4. The frequency of modulating signal has no effect on the amount of frequency deviation of a carrier signal in FM.
a) True
b) False
a
5. What type of modulation uses discrete values of carrier frequencies to transmit binary data?
a) Frequency modulation
b) Amplitude shift keying
c) Frequency shift keying
d) Phase modulation
c
6. FM and PM are more susceptible to noise than AM signals.
a) True
b) False
b
7. Which of the following is false with respect to Pulse modulation?
a) Depends only on the frequency of the modulating signal
b) Phase of the carrier wave changes with respect to the modulating signal
c) Less affected by noise
d) Used to digitally transmit analog data
a
8. What is the ratio of frequency deviation to the modulating frequency is known as?
a) Frequency index
b) Modulating index
c) Modulation index
d) Modulation ratio
c
9. What is the modulation index of a system with modulating frequency 75kHz and maximum frequency deviation 15kHz?
a) 5
b) 7
c) 3
d) 1
a

b
11. What is it called when an FM signal occupies no more spectrum space than AM signal?
a) Amplitude modulated frequency wave
b) Narrowband FM
c) Shortband FM
d) Equalband FM
b
12. What is the modulation index for the FM to behave as a narrowband?

a) 4
b) 5
c) 6
d) 7
a
14. According to Carson’s rule, what is the bandwidth of the signal with a deviation of 30kHz and a maximum modulating signal of frequency 5kHz?
a) 70kHz
b) 90kHz
c) 100kHz
d) 80kHz
a
