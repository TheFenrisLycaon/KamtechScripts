1. The resistance of pure metals ___________
a) Increases with an increase in temperature
b) Decreases with an increase in temperature
c) Remains the same with an increase in temperature
d) Becomes zero with an increase in temperature
a
2. The resistance of insulators __________
a) Increases with an increase in temperature
b) Decreases with an increase in temperature
c) Remains the same with an increase in temperature
d) Becomes zero with an increase in temperature
b
3. Which of the following statements are true about metals?
a) Metals have a positive temperature coefficient
b) Metals have a negative temperature coefficient
c) Metals have zero temperature coefficient
d) Metals have infinite temperature coefficient
a
4. Which of the following statements are true about insulators?
a) Insulators have a positive temperature coefficient
b) Insulators have a negative temperature coefficient
c) Insulators have zero temperature coefficient
d) Insulators have infinite temperature coefficient
b
5. What is the unit of temperature coefficient?
a) ohm/centigrade
b) ohm-centigrade
c) centigrade-1
d) centigrade
c
From the given expression: (R/Reff-1)/(T-Teff) = temp. coeff. Hence, the unit is the reciprocal of that of temperature = centigrade-1.
6. A copper coil has a resistance of 200 ohms when its mean temperature is 0 degree centigrade. Calculate the resistance of the coil when its mean temperature is 80 degree centigrade. Temperature coefficient of copper is 0.004041 centigrade-1
a) 264.65 ohm
b) 264.65 kilo-ohm
c) 286.65 ohm
d) 286.65 kilo-ohm
a
7. The temperature of a coil cannot be measured by which of the following methods?
a) Thermometer
b) Increase in resistance of the coil
c) Thermo-junctions embedded in the coil
d) Calorimeter
d
8. The rise or fall in resistance with the rise in temperature depends on ________
a) The property of the conductor material
b) The current in the metal
c) Property of material as well current in that material
d) Does not depend on any factor
a
9. If the temperature is increased in semi-conductors such that the resistance incessantly falls, it is termed as _______
a) Avalanche breakdown
b) Zener breakdown
c) Thermal runway
d) Avalanche runway
c
