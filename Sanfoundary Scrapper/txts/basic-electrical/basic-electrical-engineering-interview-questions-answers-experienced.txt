1. The force existing between two infinite parallel conductors is inversely proportional to ________
a) Radius of the conductors
b) Current in one of the conductors
c) The product of the current in the two conductors
d) The distance between the two conductors
d
2. When the distance of operation between the two conductors increases, what happens to the force between the two conductors?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
3. Magnetic field at a point d distance away from long wire due to electric current i in it is ____________
a) µ0i/2r
b) µ0i/r
c) µ0i/2πr
d) µ0i/πr
c
B = µ0i/2πr.
4. The force per unit length existing between two infinite parallel conductors is given by ___________
a) µ0i1i2/2πd
b) µ0i1i2/2d
c) µ0i1/2πdi2
d) µ0i1i2/d
a
F/l = Bi = µ0i1i2/2πd if d is separation of two infinite parallel conductors.
5. If the radius of the current carrying conductor increases, what is the effect on the force?
a) increases
b) decreases
c) remain same
d) become zero
c
F/l = Bi = µ0i1i2/2πd if d is separation of two infinite parallel conductors. It doesn’t depend on the radius of conductor so force remains the same.
6. If current of conductor increases, what is the effect on the force?
a) increases
b) decreases
c) remain same
d) become zero
a
F/l = Bi = µ0i1i2/2πd if d is separation of two infinite parallel conductors. So, as current increases force increases.
7. If length of current carrying conductor increases, what is the effect on the force?
a) increases
b) decreases
c) remain same
d) become zero
a
F/l = Bi = µ0i1i2/2πd if d is a separation of two infinite parallel conductors. So, as length of conductor increases force increases.
