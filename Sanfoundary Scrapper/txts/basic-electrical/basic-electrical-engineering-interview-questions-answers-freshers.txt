1. An 8microF capacitor is connected in series with a 0.5 megaohm resistor. The DC voltage supply is 200V. Calculate the time constant.
a) 1s
b) 2s
c) 3s
d) 4s
d
Therefore, time constant = 8*10-6*4*106=4s.
2. An 8microF capacitor is connected in series with a 0.5 megaohm resistor. The DC voltage supply is 200V. Calculate the initial charging current.
a) 100 microA
b) 500 microA
c) 400 microA
d) 1000microA
c
I=V/R = 200/(0.5*106s) = 400*10-6A = 400 microA.
3. A 8 microF capacitor is connected in series with a 0.5 megaohm resistor. The DC voltage supply is 200V. Calculate the time taken for the potential difference across the capacitor to grow to 160V.
a) 6.93s
b) 7.77s
c) 2.33s
d) 3.22s
a
Substituting V=160V, V0=200V, RC=4s we get,
t=6.93s.
4. An 8microF capacitor is connected in series with a 0.5 megaohm resistor. The DC voltage supply is 200V. Calculate the voltage in the capacitor 4s after the power is supplied.
a) 123.4V
b) 126.4V
c) 124.5V
d) 132.5V
b
Vc=V(1-e-t /RC). Substituting the values in the given equation, we get Vc = 126.4V.
5. An 8microF capacitor is connected in series with a 0.5 megaohm resistor. The DC voltage supply is 200V. Calculate the current in the capacitor 4s after the power is supplied.
a) 79 microA
b) 68 microA
c) 48 microA
d) 74 microA
d
6. A circuit has a resistance of 2 ohms connected in series with a capacitance of 6F. Calculate the discharging time constant.
a) 3
b) 1
c) 12
d) 8
c
7. What is the energy in a capacitor if the voltage is 5V and the charge is10C?
a) 25J
b) 35J
c) 54J
d) 55J
a
U=(Q*V)/2 = (10*5)/2 = 25 J.
