1. Among the following, which is the right formula for inductance?
a) L=emf*t/I
b) L=emf/t*I
c) L=emf*I/t
d) L=emf*t*I
a
2. Among the following, which is the right formula for inductance of N turns?
a) L=et/Ni
b) L=N*i *e*t
c) L=Ni/et
d) L=N/iet
a
emf=NLi/t
Inductance = L = et/N.
3. For a coil having a magnetic circuit of constant reluctance, the flux is ___________ to the current.
a) Directly proportional
b) Inversely proportional
c) Not related
d) Very large compared to
a
4. For a coil having a magnetic circuit of constant reluctance, if the flux increases, what happens to the current?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains constant
d) Becomes zero
a
5. The unit for inductance is ___________
a) Ohm
b) Henry
c) A/m
d) A/s
b
6. If either the inductance or the rate of change of current is doubled, the induced e.m.f?
a) Remains constant
b) Becomes zero
c) Doubles
d) Becomes half
c
7. If the current changes from 5A to 3A in 2 seconds and the inductance is 10H, calculate the emf.
a) 5V
b) 10V
c) 15V
d) 20V
b
emf=L(i2-i1)/t
Substituting the values from the question, we get emf=10V.
8. If the current changes from 5A to 3A in x sec and inductance is 10H. The emf is 10V, calculate the value of x.
a) 2s
b) 3s
c) 4s
d) 5s
a
emf=L(i2-i1)/t
Substituting the values from the question, we get x=2s.
9. If the current changes from 3A to 5A in 2s and the emf is 10V. Calculate the inductance.
a) 10H
b) 20H
c) 30H
d) 40H
a
