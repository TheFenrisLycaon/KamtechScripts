1. What is the resonance frequency of ac circuit?
a) 1/√LC
b) √(L/C)
c) √LC
d) LC
a
ωL=1/ωC
ω=1/√LC.
2. What is impedance at resonance?
a) maximum
b) minimum
c) zero
d) cannot be determined
b
Z2=R2+(XL-XC)2
Z=R  So Z is minimum at resonance.
3. What is the value of impedance at resonance?
a) XL
b) XC
c) R
d) 0
c
Z2=R2+(XL-XC)2
Z=R  So Z is minimum at resonance.
4. What is φ in terms of voltage?
a) φ=cos-1V/VR
b) φ=cos-1V*VR
c) φ=cos-1VR/V
d) φ=tan-1V/VR
c
Hence φ=cos-1VR/V.
5. What is tanϕ for RC circuit?
a) XC/R
b) XL/R
c) R/Z
d) Z/R
a
 tanϕ=XC/R.
6. What is the resonance condition?
a) When XL>XC
b) When XL<XC
c) When XL=XC
d) When XC=infinity
c
7. What is the frequency in resonance condition?
a) Minimum
b) Maximum
c) Cannot be determined
d) Zero
b
