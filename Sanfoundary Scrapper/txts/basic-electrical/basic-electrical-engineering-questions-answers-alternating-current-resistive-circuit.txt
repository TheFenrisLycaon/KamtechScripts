1. Instantaneous voltage is the product of resistance and _____________ current in a resistive circuit.
a) Instantaneous
b) Average
c) RMS
d) Peak
a
Instantaneous voltage is the product of resistance and instantaneous current in a resistive circuit.
2. Find the value of the instantaneous voltage if the resistance is 2 ohm and the instantaneous current in the circuit is 5A.
a) 5V
b) 2V
c) 10V
d) 2.5V
c
v=iR, substituting the given values from the question, we get v=10V.
3. The power for a purely resistive circuit is zero when?
a) Current is zero
b) Voltage is zero
c) Both current and voltage are zero
d) Either current or voltage is zero
d
4. The correct expression for the instantaneous current if instantaneous voltage is Vm(sint) in a resistive circuit is?
a) 1A
b) 2A
c) 3A
d) 4A
b
Since i=V/R, we can write, i=Vm(sint)/R.
5. Calculate the resistance in the circuit if the rms voltage is 20V and the rms current is 2A.
a) 2 ohm
b) 5 ohm
c) 10 ohm
d) 20 ohm
c
R=V/I
Substituting the given values from the question, we get R=10 ohm.
6. The correct expression for the instantaneous current in a resistive circuit is?
a) i=Vm(sint)/R
b) i=Vm(cost)/R
c) i=V(sint)/R
d) i=V(cost)/R
a
v=Vm(sint)
Since i=v/R, we can write,  i=Vm(sint)/R.
7. Can ohm’s law be applied in an ac circuit?
a) Yes
b) No
c) Depends on the rms current
d) Depends on the rms voltage
a
8. The correct expression for the instantaneous current if instantaneous voltage is Vm(sint) in an inductive circuit is?
a) i = Vm(sint)/XL
b) i = Vm(cost)/XL
c) i = -Vm(sint)/XL
d) i = -Vm(cost)/XL
d
I=V/XL = -Vm(cost)/XL  (since current lags voltage by 900 in inductive circuit).
