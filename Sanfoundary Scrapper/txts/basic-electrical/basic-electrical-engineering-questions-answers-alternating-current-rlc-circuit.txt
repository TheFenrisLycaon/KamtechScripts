1. Find the total voltage applied in a series RLC circuit when i=3mA, VL=30V, VC=18V and R=1000 ohms.
a) 3.95V
b) 51V
c) 32.67V
d) 6.67V
b
VR=1000*3*10-3=3V. Therefore, total voltage = 30+18+3=51V.
2. In an RLC circuit, which of the following is always used as a vector reference?
a) Voltage
b) Resistance
c) Impedance
d) Current
a
3. In an RLC circuit, the power factor is always ____________
a) Positive
b) Negative
c) Depends on the circuit
d) Zero
c
4. In an RLC series phasor, we start drawing the phasor from which quantity?
a) Voltage
b) Resistance
c) Impedance
d) Current
d
5. What is the correct expression for the phase angle in an RLC series circuit?
a) φ=tan-1(XL-XC)/R
b) φ=tan-1 (XL+XC)/R
c) φ=tan(XL-XC)/R
d) φ=tan-1 (XL-XC)
a
Hence φ=tan-1 (XL-XC)/R.
6. When is tanφ positive?
a) When inductive reactance is less than capacitive reactance
b) When inductive reactance is greater than capacitive reactance
c) When inductive reactance is equal to capacitive reactance
d) When inductive reactance is zero
b
7. When is tanφ negative?
a) When inductive reactance is less than capacitive reactance
b) When inductive reactance is greater than capacitive reactance
c) When inductive reactance is equal to capacitive reactance
d) When inductive reactance is zero
a

c) 0Hz
d) 60 Hz
c
10. Which type of ac waveform is given in figure?
a) sinusoidal
b) triangular
c) square
d) complex waveform
a
