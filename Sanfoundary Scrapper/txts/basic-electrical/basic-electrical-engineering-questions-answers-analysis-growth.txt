a) 5A
b) 10A
c) 0 A
d) 20A
c
4. A coil has a resistance of 4 ohms and an inductance of 2H. It is connected to a 20V dc supply. Calculate the final value of the current in the circuit.
a) 5A
b) 10A
c) 15A
d) 20A
a
I=V/R = 5A.
5. A coil has a resistance of 4 ohms and an inductance of 2H. It is connected to a 20V dc supply. Calculate the value of current 1s after the switch is closed.
a) 5.44A
b) 4.32A
c) 6.56A
d) 2.34A
b
i=I(1-eRt/L)
I=V/R=5A
Substituting the remaining values from the given question, we get i=4.32A.
6. A coil has a resistance of 4 ohms and an inductance of 2H. It is connected to a 20V dc supply. Calculate the value of voltage 1s after the switch is closed.
a) 5.4V
b) 10.8V
c) 0 V
d) 2.7V
d
V=20e-2=2.7V.
7. Among the following, which is the right formula for decay in an inductive circuit?
a) i=I(1-e-t/time constant)
b) i=I(1-et /time constant)
c) i=(1-e-t /time constant)

8. The discharging time constant of a circuit consisting of an inductor is the time taken for the voltage in the inductor to become __________ % of the initial voltage.
a) 33
b) 63
c) 37
d) 36
c
When t=L/R, we have: V=V0(e-1) = 0.37*Vsub>0.
Hence the time constant is the time taken for the voltage in an inductive circuit to become 0.37 times its initial voltage.
