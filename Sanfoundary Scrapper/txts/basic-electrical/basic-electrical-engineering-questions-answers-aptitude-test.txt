c) 2
d) 0.707
d
3. The rms value is 0.707 times the _________ value.
a) Peak
b) Instantaneous
c) Average
d) DC
a
4. If the phasors are drawn to represent the maximum values instead of the rms values, what would happen to the phase angle between quantities?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains constant
d) Becomes zero
c
5. Usually phasor diagrams are drawn representing?
a) RMS value
b) Peak value
c) Average value
d) Instantaneous value
a
6. If two current phasors, having magnitude 12A and 5A intersect at an angle of 90 degrees, calculate the resultant current.
a) 13 A
b) 10 A
c) 6 A
d) 5 A
a
I=13 A.
7. If two current phasors, having magnitude 5A and 10A intersect at an angle of 60 degrees, calculate the resultant current.
a) 12.23 A
b) 12.54 A
c) 13.23 A
d) 14.24 A
c
Substituting the values, we get I=13.23 A.
8. The instantaneous values of two alternating voltages are given as _________
v1=60sinθ and v2=40sin(θ − π/3). Find the instantaneous sum.
a) 87.2 sin(36.5°) V
b) 87.2 sin( 0.5°) V
c) 87.2 sin(26.5°) V
d) 87.2 cos(36.5°) V
a
Vertical component of v1=0V
Horizontal component of v2=60cos600
Vertical component of v2=60sin600
Resultant horizontal component=60cos600 + 40 = 70V
Resultant vertical component = 30√3 V
Resultant = 87.2V
tan(ϕ) = 30√3 / 70 => ϕ=36.50
Therefore sum = 87.2 sin( 36.5°) V.
9. The instantaneous values of two alternating voltages are given as:
v1=60sinθ and v2=40sin(θ − π/3). Find the instantaneous difference.
a) 53 sin(71.5°) V
b) 53 sin( 79..5°) V
c) 53 sin(26.5°) V
d) 53 cos(36.5°) V
b
Vertical component of v1=0V
Horizontal component of v2=-60cos600
Vertical component of v2=-60sin600
Resultant horizontal component=40-30 = 10V
Resultant vertical component = -30√3 V
Resultant v = 53 V
tan(ϕ) = 30√3 / 10 => ϕ=79.50
Therefore sum = 53 sin (79.5°) V.
10. The resultant of two alternating sinusoidal voltages or currents can be found using ___________
a) Triangular law
b) Parallelogram law
c) Either triangular or parallelogram law
d) Neither triangular nor parallelogram law
b
