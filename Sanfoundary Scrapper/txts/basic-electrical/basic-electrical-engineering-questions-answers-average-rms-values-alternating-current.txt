1. Find the average value of current when the current that are equidistant are 4A, 5A and 6A.
a) 5A
b) 6A
c) 15A
d) 10A
a
2. What is the current found by finding the current in an equidistant region and dividing by n?
a) RMS current
b) Average current
c) Instantaneous current
d) Total current
b
3. RMS stands for ________
a) Root Mean Square
b) Root Mean Sum
c) Root Maximum sum
d) Root Minimum Sum
a
4. What is the type of current obtained by finding the square of the currents and then finding their average and then fining the square root?
a) RMS current
b) Average current
c) Instantaneous current
d) Total current
a
5. __________ current is found by dividing the area enclosed by the half cycle by the length of the base of the half cycle.
a) RMS current
b) Average current
c) Instantaneous current
d) Total current
b
6. What is the effective value of current?
a) RMS current
b) Average current
c) Instantaneous current
d) Total current
a
7. In a sinusoidal wave, average current is always _______ rms current.
a) Greater than
b) Less than
c) Equal to
d) Not related
b
8. For a rectangular wave, average current is ______ rms current.
a) Greater than
b) Less than
c) Equal to
d) Not related
c
9. Peak value divided by the rms value gives us?
a) Peak factor
b) Crest factor
c) Both peak and crest factor
d) Neither peak nor crest factor
c
10. Calculate the crest factor if the peak value of current is 10A and the rms value is 2A.
a) 5
b) 10
c) 5A
d) 10A
a
Crest factor = Peak value/RMS value.
Substituting the values from the given question, we get crest factor=5.
