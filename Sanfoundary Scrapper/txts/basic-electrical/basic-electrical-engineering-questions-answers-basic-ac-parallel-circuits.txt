1. In a parallel circuit, we consider _____________ instead of impedance.
a) Resistance
b) Capacitance
c) Inductance
d) Admittance
d
2. In a parallel circuit, we consider admittance instead of _________
a) Resistance
b) Capacitance
c) Inductance
d) Impedance
d
3. Which, among the following is the correct expression for impedance?
a) Z=Y
b) Z=1/Y
c) Z=Y2
d) Z=1/Y2
b
4. Which, among the following is the correct expression for admittance?
a) Y=Z
b) Y=1/Z
c) Y=Z2
d) Y=1/Z2
b
5. What is the unit of admittance?
a) ohm
b) henry
c) farad
d) ohm-1
d
6. As the impedance increases, the admittance ____________
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
7. if the impedance of a system is 4 ohm, calculate its admittance.
a) 0.25 ohm-1
b) 4 ohm-1
c) 25 ohm-1
d) 0.4 ohm-1
a
Substituting the value of Z from the question, we get Y = 1/4 = 0.25 => Y= 0.25 ohm-1.
8. The admittance of a system is 10 ohm-1, calculate its impedance.
a) 10 ohm
b) 0.1 ohm
c) 1 ohm
d) 1.1 ohm
b
Z = 1/10 = 0.1  =>  Z = 0.1 ohm.
9. In A parallel circuit, with any number of impedances, The voltage across each impedance is?
a) equal
b) divided equally
c) divided proportionaly
d) zero
a
10. In a parallel circuit, current in each impedance is_____________
a) equal
b) different
c) zero
d) infinite
b
