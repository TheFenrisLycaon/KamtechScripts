a) alternating current
b) direct current
c) both alternating and direct current
d) neither alternating nor direct current
b
4. Why does capacitor block dc signal at steady state?
a) due to high frequency of dc signal
b) due to zero frequency of dc signal
c) capacitor doesnot pass any current at steady state
