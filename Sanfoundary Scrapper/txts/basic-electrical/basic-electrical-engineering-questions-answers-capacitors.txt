1. What is the relation between current and voltage in a capacitor?
a) I=1/C*integral(Vdt)
b) I=CdV/dt
c) I=1/CdV/dt
d) I=Ct
b
I=dQ/dt. Q=CV. C(capacitance) is constant for a given capacitor so I=CdV/dt.
2. If 2V is supplied to a 3F capacitor, calculate the charge stored in the capacitor.
a) 1.5C
b) 6C
c) 2C
d) 3C
b
Q=3*2=6C.
3. Calculate the current in the capacitor having 2V supply voltage and 3F capacitance in 2seconds.
a) 2A
b) 5A
c) 6A
d) 3A
d
Q=3*2=6C.
I=Q/t = 6/2 = 3A.
4. A 4microF capacitor is charged to 120V, the charge in the capacitor would be?
a) 480C
b) 480microC
c) 30C
d) 30microC
b
Q=4*120=480microC.
5. For high frequencies, capacitor acts as _________
a) Open circuit
b) Short circuit
c) Amplifier
d) Rectifier
b
6. For very low frequencies, capacitor acts as ________
a) Open circuit
b) Short circuit
c) Amplifier
d) Rectifier
a
7. A capacitor consists of_________
a) Two conductors
b) Two semiconductors
c) Two dielectrics
d) Two insulators
a
8. Capacitor preferred when there is high frequency in the circuits is __________
a) Electrolyte capacitor
b) Mica capacitor
c) Air capacitor
d) Glass capacitor
b
9. Capacitance increases with ________
a) Increase in plate area
b) Decrease in plate area
c) Increase in distance between the plates
d) Increase in density of the material
a
10. Capacitance increases with __________
a) Increase in distance between the plates
b) Decrease in plate area
c) Decrease in distance between the plates
d) Increase in density of the material
c
