1. What is the equivalent inductance when inductors are connected in series?
a) Sum of all the individual inductances
b) Product of all the individual inductances
c) Sum of the reciprocal of all the individual inductances
d) Product of the reciprocal of all the individual inductances
a
2. When inductances are connected in series, the equivalent inductance is ____________ the largest individual inductance.
a) Greater than
b) Less than
c) Equal to
d) Not related to
a
3. Three inductors having inductance values 3H, 4H and 5H are connected in series, calculate the equivalent inductance.
a) 10H
b) 12H
c) 3H
d) 5H
b
Hence Leq= L1+L2+L3= 12H.
4. Calculate the equivalent inductance between A and B.
a) 30H
b) 54H
c) 44H
d) 60H
c
Leq=L1+L2+L3+L4=44H.
5. When inductors are connected in series, the voltage across each inductor is _________
a) Equal
b) Different
c) Zero
d) Infinity
b
6. In a series circuit, which of the parameters remain constant across all circuit elements such as resistor, capacitor, inductor etc?
a) Voltage
b) Current
c) Both voltage and current
d) Neither voltage nor current
b
7. Find voltage across 2H inductor.
a) 2V
b) 10V
c) 12V
d) 20V
a
Leq=2+10+12+20=44H
di/dt=44/44 = 1 A/s.
Voltage across 2H inductor = 2*di/dt = 2*1=2V.
8. Find voltage across 10H inductor.
a) 2V
b) 10V
c) 12V
d) 20V
b
Leq=2+10+12+20=44H
di/dt=44/44 = 1 A/s.
Voltage across 10H inductor = 10*di/dt = 10*1=10V.
9. Find voltage across 12H inductor.
a) 2V
b) 10V
c) 12V
d) 20V
c
Leq=2+10+12+20=44H
di/dt=44/44 = 1 A/s.
Voltage across 12H inductor = 12*di/dt = 12*1=12V.
10. Find voltage across 20H inductor.
a) 2V
b) 10V
c) 12V
d) 20V
d
Leq=2+10+12+20=44H
di/dt=44/44 = 1 A/s.
Voltage across 20H inductor = 20*di/dt = 20*1=20V.
