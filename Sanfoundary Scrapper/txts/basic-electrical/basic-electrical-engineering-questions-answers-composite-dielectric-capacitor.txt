b) Electric field strength*area of a cross section
c) Electric field strength
d) Zero
a
2. The electric field strength is 10N/C and the thickness of the dielectric is 3m. Calculate the potential drop in the dielectric.
a) 10V
b) 20V
c) 30V
d) 40V
c
3. The electric fields of dielectrics having the same cross sectional area in series are related to their relative permittivities in which way?
a) Directly proportional
b) Inversely proportional
c) Equal
d) Not related
b
4. What happens to the capacitance when a dielectric is introduced between its plates?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
a
C=k∈0A/d.
5. Calculate the relative permittivity of the second dielectric if the relative permittivity of the first is 4. The electric field strength of the first dielectric is 8V/m and that of the second is 2V/m.
a) 32
b) 4
c) 16
d) 8
c
E1/E1=e2/e1. Substituting the given values, we get e2=16.
6. What happens to the potential drop between the two plates of a capacitor when a dielectric is introduced between the plates?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
7. If the potential difference across the plates of a capacitor is 10V and a dielectric having thickness 2m is introduced between the plates, calculate the potential difference after introducing the dielectric. The electric field strength is 2V/m.
a) 4V
b) 6V
c) 8V
d) 10V
b
New potential difference= potential difference without dielectric-potential difference of dielectric = 10-2*2 = 6V.
8. Calculate the capacitance if the dielectric constant=4, area of cross section= 10m2 and the distance of separation between the plates is 5m.
a) 7.08*10-11F
b) 7.08*1011F
c) 7.08*10-12F
d) 7.08*10-10F
a
C=ke0A/d. Substituting the given values in the equation, we get C = 7.08*10-11F.
9. A dielectric is basically a ________
a) Capacitor
b) Conductor
c) Insulator
d) Semiconductor
c
10. What happens to the potential difference between the plates of a capacitor as the thickness of the dielectric slab increases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
New potential difference= potential difference without dielectric-potential difference of dielectric. Hence as the thickness of the dielectric slab increases, a larger value is subtracted from the original potential difference.
