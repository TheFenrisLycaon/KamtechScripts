a
6. What happens to the coupling coefficient when the flux linkage of coil 1 and coil 2 increases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
a
7. What is the SI unit of coupling coefficient?

c
8. Find the coupling coefficient if the Mutual inductance is 20H, the inductance of coil 1 is 2H and the inductance of coil 2 is 8H.
a) 5
b) 20
c) 2
d) 8
a
k=M/sqrt(L1L2)
Substituting the values from the question, we get k=5.

a) 10H
b) 20H
c) 16H
d) 15H
b
k=M/sqrt(L1L2)
Substituting the values from the question, we get M=20H.
10. Find the value of x if the Mutual inductance is 20H, the inductance of coil 1 is xH and the inductance of coil 2 is 8H. The coupling coefficient is 5.
a) 2H
b) 4H
c) 6H
d) 8H
a
k=M/sqrt(L1L2)
Substituting the values from the question, we get L1=2H.
