1. In a series RLC circuit, the phase difference between the current in the capacitor and the current in the resistor is?
a) 00
b) 900
c) 1800
d) 3600

4. In a series RLC circuit, the phase difference between the current in the circuit and the voltage across the resistor is?
a) 00
b) 900
c) 1800
d) 3600

5. In a series RLC circuit, the phase difference between the current in the circuit and the voltage across the capacitor is?
a) 00
b) 900

6. _________ the resonant frequency, the current in the inductor lags the voltage in a series RLC circuit.
a) Above
b) Below
c) Equal to
d) Depends on the circuit
a
ωL > 1/ωC   => ω > 1/√LC  => ω > ω0.
So, the current in the inductor lags the voltage in a series RLC circuit above the resonant frequency.
7. _________ the resonant frequency, the current in the capacitor leads the voltage in a series RLC circuit.
a) Above
b) Below
c) Equal to
d) Depends on the circuit
b
ωL < 1/ωC   => ω < 1/√LC  => ω < ω0.
So, the current in the capacitor leads the voltage in a series RLC circuit below the resonant frequency.
