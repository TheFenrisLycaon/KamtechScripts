1. The unit for dielectric strength is ____________
a) V/m2
b) MV/m2
c) MV/m
d) Vm
c
2. If the Voltage increases, what happens to dielectric strength?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
a
3. If the potential difference in a material is 4MV and the thickness of the material is 2m, calculate the dielectric strength.
a) 2MV/m
b) 4MV/m
c) 6MV/m
d) 8MV/m
a
Dielectric strength= V/t= 4/2= 2MV/m.
4. If the dielectric strength of a material is 4MV/m and its potential difference is 28MV, calculate the thickness of the material.
a) 4m
b) 7m
c) 5m
d) 11m
b
V/dielectric strength= t= 28/4=7m.
5. If the thickness of the material increases, what happens to the dielectric strength?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
6. The thickness of a material having dielectric strength 10MV/m is 5m, calculate the potential difference.
a) 2MV
b) 10MV
c) 50MV
d) 100MV
c
V=t*dielectric strength= 5*10=50MV.
7. Which medium has the highest dielectric strength?
a) Water
b) Mica
c) Air
d) Glass
c
