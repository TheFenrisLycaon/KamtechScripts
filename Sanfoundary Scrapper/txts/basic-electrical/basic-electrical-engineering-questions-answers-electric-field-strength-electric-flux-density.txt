1. Gauss law is applicable for_________
a) Point charge
b) Sheet charge
c) Line charge
d) Point, sheet and line charge
d
2. “Total electric flux through any closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed by that surface divided by permittivity”. This is the statement for?
a) Gauss law
b) Lenz law
c) Coloumb’s law
d) Faraday’s law
a
3. Electric flux density is a function of_______
a) Volume
b) Charge
c) Current
d) Voltage
b
4. As charge increases, what happens to flux density?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains constant
d) Becomes zero
a
D=Q/A. Electric flux is directly proportional to charge, hence as charge increases, electric flux also increases.
5. As area increases, what happens to electric flux density?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains constant
d) Becomes zero
b
D=Q/A. Electric flux is inversely proportional to area, hence an area increases, electric flux decreases.
6. Which, among the following, is the correct expression for electric flux density?
a) D=epsilon*E
b) D=epsilon/E
c) D2=epsilon*E
d) D=epsilon*E2
a
7. Strength of the electric field is ___________
a) Directly proportional to the force applied
b) Inversely proportional to the force applied
c) Directly proportional to the square of the force applied
d) Inversely proportional to the square of the force applied
a
8. The force applied to a conductor is 10N if the charge in the conductor is 5C, what is the electric field intensity?
a) 10V/m
b) 2V/m
c) 3V/m
d) 15V/m
b
E = F/Q = 10/5 = 2V/m.
9. What is the electric flux density in free space if the electric field intensity is 1V/m?
a) 7.76*10-12C/m2
b) 8.85*10-12C /m2
c) 1.23*10-12C /m2
d) 3.43*10-12C /m2
b
D=epsilon*E = 1*8.85*10-12 = 8.85*10-12C /m2.
10. If the charge in a conductor is 16C and the area of cross section is 4m2. Calculate the electric flux density.
a) 64C/m2
b) 16C/m2
c) 4C/m2
d) 2C/m2
c
D = Q/A = 16/4 = 4C/m2.
