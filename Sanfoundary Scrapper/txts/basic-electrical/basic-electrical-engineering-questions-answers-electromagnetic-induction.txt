1. An E.M.F. can be induced by _________
a) Change in the magnetic field only
b) Change in the area of cross section only
c) Change in angle between magnetic field and area only
d) Change in the magnetic field, area or angle between them
d
ϕ=BAcos(θ), hence if either of the three, that is, magnetic field, area or angle changes, the emf will change, flux changes due to which emf can be induced.

a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains constant
d) Reverses
a
