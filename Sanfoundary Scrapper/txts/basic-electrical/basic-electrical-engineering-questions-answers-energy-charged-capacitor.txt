1. Work done in charging a capacitor is ____________
a) QV
b) 1⁄2QV
c) 2QV
d) QV2
b
Substituting C as Q/V, we get work done = Q/2V.
2. Energy stored in 2000mF capacitor charged to a potential difference of 10V is?
a) 100J
b) 200J
c) 300J
d) 400J
a
WD = CV2/2 = 100J.
3. When do we get maximum energy from a set of capacitors?
a) When they are connected in parallel
b) When they are connected in series
c) Both in series and parallel
d) Insufficient information provided
a
Energy=CV2/2, hence as the capacitance increases, the energy stored in it also increases.
4. If the charge stored in a capacitor is 4C and the value of capacitance is 2F, calculate the energy stored in it.
a) 2J
b) 4J
c) 8J
d) 16J
b
U=Q2/2C = 4*4/(2*2) = 4J.
5. If the charge in a capacitor is 4C and the energy stored in it is 4J, find the value of capacitance.
a) 2F
b) 4F
c) 8F
d) 16F
a
U=Q2/2C.
Substituting the values of U and Q, we get C=2F.
6. If the charge in a capacitor is 4C and the energy stored in it is 4J, calculate the voltage across its plates.
a) 2V
b) 4V
c) 8V
d) 16V
a
U=Q2/2C.
Substituting the values of U and Q, we get C=2F.
V=Q/C, hence V=4/2=2V.
7. Calculate the energy in the 2F capacitor.
a) 8.6kJ
b) 64kJ
c) 64J
d) 6.4kJ
d
WD= CV2/2 = 2*802/2=6400J=6.4kJ.
8. Calculate the energy in the 4F capacitor.
a) 128kJ
b) 1.28kJ
c) 12.8kJ
d) 1280J
c
WD = CV2/2 = 4*802/2 = 12800J = 12.8kJ.
9. Calculate the energy stored in the combination of the capacitors.
a) 192kJ
b) 1.92kJ
c) 19.2kJ
d) 1920J
c
From the expression:
WD = CV2/2 = 6*802/2 = 19200J = 19.2kJ.
