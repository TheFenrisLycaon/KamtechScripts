1. If maximum value of current is 5√2 A, what will be the value of RMS current?
a) 10 A
b) 5 A
c) 15 A
d) 25 A
b
Substituting the value of max current we get, rms current = 5A.
2. If Im is the maximum value of a sinusoidal voltage, what is the instantaneous value?
a) i=Im/2
b) i=Imsinθ
c) i=Imcosθ
d) i=Imsinθ or i=Imcosθ
d
3. Average value of current over a half cycle is?
a) 0.67Im
b) 0.33Im
c) 6.7Im
d) 3.3Im
a
4. What is the correct expression for the rms value of current?
a) Irms=Im/2
b) Irms=Im/√2
c) Irms=Im/4
d) Irms=Im
b
Irms=Im/√2.
5. Average value of current over a full cycle is?
a) 0.67Im
b) 0
c) 6.7Im
d) 3.3Im
b

6. What is the correct expression for the form factor?
a) Irms * Iav
b) Irms / Iav
c) Irms + Iav
d) Irms – Iav
b
7. For a direct current, the rms current is ________ the mean current.
a) Greater than
b) Less than
c) Equal to
d) Not related to
c
8. For a direct current, the rms voltage is ________ the mean voltage.
a) Greater than
b) Less than
c) Equal to
d) Not related to
c
9. What is the value of the form factor for sinusoidal current?
a) π/2
b) π/4
c) 2π
d) π/√2
a
Iav=√2 Im/π
So, form factor = Irms/Iav = π/2.
10. If the maximum value of the current is 5√2 A, what will be the value of the average current?
a) 10/π A
b) 5/π A
c) 15/π A
d) 25/π A
a
Substituting the value of max current we get, rms current = 10/π A.
