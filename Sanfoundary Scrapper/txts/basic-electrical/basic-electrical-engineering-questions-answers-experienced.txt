b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
a
3. When the potential gradient increases, what happens to the force between the plates?

b
5. A metal parallel plate capacitor has 100mm diameter and the distance between the plates is 1mm. The capacitor is placed in air. Calculate the force on each plate if the potential difference between the plates is 1kV.
a) 350N
b) 0.035kN
c) 0.035N
d) 3.35kN
c
A=pi*d2/4=0.007854m2
Potential gradient = V/x = 106V/m
F=epsilon*A*(V/x)2/2
Therefore, F=0.035N.
6.  A metal parallel plate capacitor has 100mm diameter and the distance between the plates is ‘a’ mm. The capacitor is placed in air. Force on each plate is 0.035N and the potential difference between the plates is 1kV. Find ‘a’.
a) 1m
b) 1cm
c) 10cm
d) 1mm
d
A=pi*d2/4=0.007854m2
Potential gradient = V/x = 1000/a
F=epsilon*A*(V/x)2/2
Substituting the given values, we find a=1mm.
7. A metal parallel plate capacitor has ‘a’mm diameter and the distance between the plates is 1mm. The capacitor is placed in air. Force on each plate is 0.035N and the potential difference between the plates is 1kV. Find ‘a’.
a) 10mm
b) 100mm
c) 1000m
d) 1000cm
b
A=pi*d2/4=pi*a2/4
Potential gradient = V/x = 106V/m
F=epsilon*A*(V/x)2/2
Substituting the given values, we get d=100mm.
8. A metal parallel plate capacitor has 100mm diameter and the distance between the plates is 1mm. The capacitor is placed in air. Calculate the potential difference between the plates if the force on each plate is 0.035N.
a) 1kV
b) 1V
c) 2kV
d) 2V
a
A=pi*d2/4=0.007854m2
Potential gradient = V/x = 1000*V
F=epsilon*A*(V/x)2/2
Substituting the given values in the above expression, we get V=1kV.
9. What happens to the force of attraction between the capacitors when the potential difference between the plates decreases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
10. What happens to the force of attraction between the capacitors when the distance of separation between the plates increases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
