1. What is the expression for force in a current carrying conductor?
a) F=K/r2
b) F=Kq/r2
c) F=Kq1q2/r2
d) F=Kq1q2/r
c
2. Force in a conductor is__________ to the product of the charges.
a) Directly proportional
b) Inversely proportional
c) Not related
d) Cannot be determined
a
3. Force in a conductor is __________ to the square of the distance between the charges.
a) Directly proportional
b) Inversely proportional
c) Not related
d) Cannot be determined
b
4. Calculate the force between two charges having magnitude 3nC and 2nC separated by a distance of 2micro m.
a) 13.5N
b) 13.5kN
c) 1.35N
d) 1.35kN
b
F=Kq1q2/r2, the value of K being 9*109, we get F=13.5kN.

d) Half the original value
a
6. The ratio of magnetic force to electric force on a charged particle getting undeflected in a field is ______
a) 1
b) 0
c) 2
d) 4
a
7. Weakest force in nature is __________
a) Electric force
b) Gravitational force
c) Weak force
d) Magnetic force
a
8. The relation between the direction of force and the direction of magnetic field is __________
a) Same direction
b) Opposite direction
c) Perpendicular
d) Unrelated
c
9. The relation between the direction of current and the direction of the force is ________
a) Same direction
b) Opposite direction
c) Perpendicular
d) Unrelated
c
