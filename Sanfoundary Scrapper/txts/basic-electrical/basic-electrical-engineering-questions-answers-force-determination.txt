5. The unit for force in a current carrying conductor is _________
a) Tesla*Ampere*metre
b) Tesla
c) Ampere/metre
d) Ampere*metre
a
6. If net force is zero on a particle in magnetic field what is relation between velocity and magnetic field?
a) v=E*B
b) v=E/B
c) v=B/E
d) v=1/(E*B)
b
Electric force = Magnetic force
QE = QvB => E=vB or v=E/B.
7. If the intensity of the magnetic field is 100T, the length of the conductor is 10m and the magnitude of force perpendicular to the magnetic field is 10kN,calculate the current in the conductor.
a) 100 A
b) 100 mA
c) 10 A
d) 10 mA
c
F=Bil
Substituting the values from the question, we get i = 10A.
8. If the intensity of the magnetic field perpendicular to current carrying conductor is 100T, the length of the conductor is 3m and the current in the conductor is 10A, calculate the magnitude of force perpendicular to the electric field.
a) 300N
b) 30N
c) 30kN
d) 3kN
d
F=Bil
Substituting the values from the question, we get F=3kN.
9. Force in current carrying conductor placed in magnetic field is ___________ of il and B.
a) dot product
b) scalar product
c) cross product
d) vector addition
c
