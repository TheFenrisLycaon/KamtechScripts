1. If the resonant frequency in a series RLC circuit is 50kHz along with a bandwidth of 1kHz, find the quality factor.
a) 5
b) 50
c) 100
d) 500
b
Q=fres/Bandwidth = 50/1 = 50.
2. What is the SI unit for quality factor?
a) Hz
b) kHz
c) MHz
d) No unit
d
3. What happens to the quality factor when the bandwidth increases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
Quality factor is inversely proportional to bandwidth. So, if bandwidth increases quality factor decreases.
4. What happens to the quality factor when resonant frequency increases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
a
Quality factor is directly proportional to resonant frequency. So, if resonant frequency increases quality factor increases.
5. Resonance frequency occurs when __________________
a) XL=XC
b) XL>XC
c) XL<XC
d) Cannot be determined
a
6. The current leads the supply voltage in a series RLC circuit has its frequency _________ the resonant frequency.
a) Above
b) Below
c) Equal to
d) Cannot be determined
b
So, frequency less than resonant frequency.
7. What is the power factor of a series RLC circuit under resonance condition?
a) 0
b) 1
c) Infinity
d) 100
b
Φ=00 => cos ϕ = 1  i.e.  power factor = 1.
8. The current lags the supply voltage in a series RLC circuit has its frequency _________ the resonant frequency.
a) Above
b) Below
c) Equal to
d) Cannot be determined
a
So, frequency more than resonant frequency.
9. What is the correct formula for quality factor?
a) Q=BW*fr
b) Q=BW/fr
c) Q=fr/BW
d) Q=fr2
c
