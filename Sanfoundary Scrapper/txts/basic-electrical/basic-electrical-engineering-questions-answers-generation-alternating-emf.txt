1. Which, among the following, is the correct expression for alternating emf generated?
a) e=2Blvsin(θ)
b) e=2B2lvsin(θ)
c) e=Blvsin(θ)
d) e=4Blvsin(θ)
c
2. What should theta be in order to get maximum emf?
a) 00
b) 900
c) 1800
d) 450
b
3. Calculate the maximum emf when the velocity is 10m/s, the length is 3m and the magnetic field density is 5T.
a) 150V
b) 100V
c) 300V
d) 0V
a
Substituting the values from the given question, we get e=150V.
4. When a coil is rotated in a magnetic field, the emf induced in it?
