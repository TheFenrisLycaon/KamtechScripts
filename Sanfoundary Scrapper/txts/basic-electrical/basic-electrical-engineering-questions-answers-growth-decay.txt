1. The charging time constant of a circuit consisting of a capacitor is the time taken for the charge in the capacitor to become __________ % of the initial charge.
a) 33
b) 63
c) 37
d) 36
b
When RC=t, we have: Q=Q0(1-e-1) = 0.63*Q0.
Hence the time constant is the time taken for the charge in a capacitive circuit to become 0.63 times its initial charge.
2. The discharging time constant of a circuit consisting of a capacitor is the time taken for the charge in the capacitor to become __________ % of the initial charge.
a) 33
b) 63
c) 37
d) 36
c
When RC=t, we have: Q=Q0(1-e-1) = 0.37*Q0.
Hence the time constant is the time taken for the charge in a capacitive circuit to become 0.37 times its initial charge.
