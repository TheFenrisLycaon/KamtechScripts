1. In a pure inductive circuit, the power factor is?
a) Maximum
b) Minimum
c) 0
d) Infinity
c
2. Among the following, which is the right formula for growth in an inductive circuit?
a) VL=V(1-e-tR/L)
b) VL=(e-tR/L)
c) VL=(1-e-tR/L)
d) VL=V(e-tR/L)
d
3. The charging time constant of a circuit consisting of an inductor is the time taken for the voltage in the inductor to become __________ % of the initial voltage.
a) 33
b) 63
c) 37
d) 36
c
When time constant=t, we have: V=V0(1-e-1) = 0.37*V0.
Hence the time constant is the time taken for the charge in an inductive circuit to become 0.37 times its initial charge.
4. What is the time constant of an inductive circuit?
a) LR
b) R/L
c) 1/LR
d) L/R

5. Calculate the time constant of an inductive circuit having resistance 5 ohm and inductance 10H.
a) 2s
b) 4s
c) 5s
d)10s
a
Substituting the values from the given question, we get a time constant = 2s.
6. Calculate the resistance in an inductive circuit whose time constant is 2s and the inductance is 10H.
a) 7ohm
b) 10ohm
c) 2ohm
d) 5ohm
d
Substituting the values from the given question, we get R=5ohm.
7. Calculate the inductance in an inductive circuit whose time constant is 2s and the resistance is 5 ohm.
a) 10H
b) 20H
c) 5H
d) 15H
a
Substituting the values from the given question, we get L=10H.
8. The charging time constant of a circuit consisting of an inductor is the time taken for the current in the inductor to become __________% of the initial current.
a) 33
b) 63
c) 37
d) 36
b
When t=L/R, we have: i=i0(1-e-1) = 0.63*i0.
Hence the time constant is the time taken for the current in an inductive circuit to become 0.63 times its initial current.
