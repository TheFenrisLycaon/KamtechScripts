1. In case of Inductive circuit, Frequency is ______________ to the inductance.
a) Directly proportional
b) Inversely proportional
c) Unrelated
d) Much greater than
b
XL=2*π*f*L.
Therefore: f is inversely proportional to L.
2. In case of Inductive circuit, Frequency is ______________ to the current.
a) Directly proportional
b) Inversely proportional
c) Unrelated
d) Much greater than
b
XL=2*π*f*L =>  i=V/(2*π*f*L)
Therefore: f is inversely proportional to i.
3. In an inductive circuit, when the XL value increases, the circuit power factor?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
As XL increases, tan ϕ increases, ϕ increases, cos ϕ decreases and hence power factor decreases.
4. If the current and voltage are 90 degrees out of phase, the power factor will be?
a) 0
b) Infinity
c) 1
d) Insufficient information provided
a
5. In a pure inductive circuit, the power factor is __________
a) Maximum
b) Minimum
c) 0
d) Infinity
c

6. If the power factor is 1/10 and the value of impedance is 20 ohm, calculate the resistance in the circuit.
a) 1 ohm
b) 2 ohm
c) 3 ohm
d) 4 ohm
b
cos(ϕ)=R/Z
R=Z cos(ϕ) = 20/10 = 2 ohm.
7. If the resistance in a circuit is 2 ohm and the impedance is 20 ohm, calculate the power factor.
a) 1/10
b) 1/20
c) 1/30
d) 1/40
a
cos(ϕ)=R/Z = 2/20 = 1/10 ohm.
8. If tan ϕ = 10 and the resistance is 2 ohm, calculate the inductive reactance.
a) 10 ohm
b) 20 ohm
c) 30 ohm
d) 40 ohm
b
tan(ϕ)=XL/R
From the given question, we find that the inductive reactance is 20 ohm.
9. What is the unit for inductive reactance?
a) Henry
b) Ohm
c) Farad
d) Volts
b
10. An induced emf is said to be ________
a) Inductive
b) Capacitive
c) Resistive
d) Cannot be determined
a
