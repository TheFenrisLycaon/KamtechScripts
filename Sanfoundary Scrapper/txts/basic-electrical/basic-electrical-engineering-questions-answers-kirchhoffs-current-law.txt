1. Find the value of v if v1=20V and value of current source is 6A.
a) 10V
b) 12V
c) 14V
d) 16V
b
Thus the drop in the 2 ohm resistor = 4×2 = 8V.
v1=20V; hence v2=20-v across 2 ohm resistor=20-8=12V
v2=v since they are connected in parallel.
v=12V.
2. Calculate the current A.
a) 5A
b) 10A
c) 15A
d) 20A
c
3. Calculate the current across the 20 ohm resistor.
a) 20A
b) 1A
c) 0.67A
d) 0.33A
d
4. Calculate the value of I3, if I1= 2A and I2=3A.
a) -5A
b) 5A
c) 1A
d) -1A
a
5. Find the value of i2, i4 and i5 if i1=3A, i3=1A and i6=1A.
a) 2,-1,2
b) 4,-2,4
c) 2,1,2
d) 4,2,4
a
At junction b: i4+i2-i6=0. i4=-1A.
At junction c: i3-i5-i4=0. i5=2A.
6. What is the value of current if a 50C charge flows in a conductor over a period of 5 seconds?
a) 5A
b) 10A
