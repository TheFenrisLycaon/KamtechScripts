1. Find the value of I1, I2 and I3.
a) -0.566A, 1.29A, -1.91A
b) -1.29A, -0.566A, 1.91A
c) 1.29A, -0.566A, -1.91A
d) 1.91A, 0.566A, 1.29A
c
Matrix(3,-2,0) (I1)=(5)
         (-2,9,-4) (I2)=(0)
          (0,-4,9) (I3)=(-15)
Solving this matrix equation, we get I1 = 1.29A, I2 = -0.566A and I3 = -1.91A.
2. Find the value of V, if the value of I3= 0A.
a) 1.739 V
b) 6.5 V
c) 4.5V
d)2.739V
a
On solving,V=1.739V.
3. Find the value of R if the power in the circuit is 1000W.
a) 10 ohm
b) 9 ohm
c) 8 ohm
d) 7 ohm
c
VI=P =>100I=1000 => I=10A.
Voltage across the 2 ohm resistor = 20V.
Voltage across the R resistor = 100-20= 80V.
R=V/I => R=80/10 = 8A.
4. Find the current in the 4 ohm resistor.
a) 5A
b) 0A
c) 2.2A
d) 20A
b

7. What is the current in the circuit?
a) 0A
b) 15A
c) 5A
d) 10A
a
8. Does the 15A source have any effect on the circuit?
a) Yes
b) No
c) Cannot be determined
d) Yes, only when the 10V source is removed
b
9. KVL is associated with____________
a) Mesh analysis
b) Nodal analysis
c) Both mesh and nodal
d) Neither mesh nor nodal
a
10. KCL is associated with_________
a) Mesh analysis
b) Nodal analysis
c) Both mesh and nodal
d) Neither mesh nor nodal
b
