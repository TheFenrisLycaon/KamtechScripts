b) Momentum
c) Charge
d) Energy
d
3. Calculate the voltage across the 10 ohm resistor.
a) 12V
b) 4V
c) 10V
d) 0V
b
Voltage across 10 ohm resistor is 10*(12/30) = 4V.
4. Find the value of the currents I1 and I2.
a) 0.3, 0.1
b) -0.1, -0.3
c) -0.3, -0.1
d) 0.1, 0.2
d
Using KVL in outer loop, -100i2+20=0  i2=0.2A.
5. The sum of the voltages over any closed loop is equal to __________
a) 0V
b) Infinity
c) 1V
d) 2V
a

a) Newton’s laws
b) Faraday’s laws
c) Ampere’s laws
d) Kirchhoff’s law
d
7. Every____________ is a ____________ but every __________ is not a __________
a) Mesh, loop, loop, mesh
b) Loop, mesh, mesh, loop
c) Loop, mesh, loop, mesh

a
8. What is the voltage across the 5 ohm resistor if current source has current of 17/3 A?
a) 2.32V
b) 5.21V
c) 6.67V
d) 8.96V
b
In loop 2,  i2(4+1+5)-4i1-5=0 =>-4i1+10i2=5.
Solving these equations simultaneously i2=1.041A and i1=1.352A
V=i2*5= 5.21V.

a) 3.5V
b) 12V
c) 9.5V
d) 6.5V
a
For branch B: VBC= 10*20/(10+40)=4V
Applying KVL to loop ABC:
VAB+VBC+VCA=0
VAB=3.5V.
