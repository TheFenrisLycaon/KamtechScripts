1. The maximum power drawn from source depends on __________
a) Value of source resistance
b) Value of load resistance
c) Both source and load resistance
d) Neither source or load resistance
b
2. The maximum power is delivered to a circuit when source resistance is __________ load resistance.
a) Greater than
b) Equal to
c) Less than
d) Greater than or equal to
b
3. If source impedance is a complex number Z, then load impedance is equal to _________
a) Z’
b) -Z
c) -Z’
d) Z
a
4. If ZL=Zs’, then RL=?
a) -RL
b) Rs
c) -Rs
d) 0
b
5. Calculate the value of RL across A and B.
a) 3.45ohm
b) 2.91ohm
c) 6.34ohm
d) 1.54ohm
b
RL=3||2+4||3 = 1.20+1.71 = 2.91 ohm.

6. Calculate Eth.
a) 3.43V
b) 4.57V
c) 3.23V
d) 5.34V
b
(VA-10)/3+VA/2=0
(VB-20)/4+VB/3=0
On solving the two equations, we get VA=4V, VB=8.571V.
VAB = VA-VB = 4V – 8.571V = -4.57V.
Eth = 4.57V.
7. Calculate the maximum power transferred.
a) 1.79W
b) 4.55W
c) 5.67W
d) 3.78W
a
RL=3||2+4||3 =1.20+1.71=2.91 ohm.
The two nodal equations are:
(VA-10)/3+VA/2=0
(VB-20)/4+VB/3=0
On solving the two equations, we get VA=4V, VB=8.571V.
VAB=VA-VB = 4V – 8.571V = -4.57V.
Eth=4.57V
The maximum power transferred = Eth2/4RL. Substituting the given values in the formula, we get Pmax = 1.79W.
8. Does maximum power transfer imply maximum efficiency?
a) Yes
b) No
c) Sometimes
d) Cannot be determined
b
9. Under the condition of maximum power efficiency is?
a) 100%
b) 0%
c) 30%
d) 50%
d
Power Output=I2RL, Power Input=I2(RL+RS)
Under maximum power transfer conditions, RL=RS
Power Output=I2RL; Power Input=2*I2RL
Thus efficiency=50%.
10. Name some devices where maximum power has to be transferred to the load rather than maximum efficiency.
a) Amplifiers
b) Communication circuits
c) Both amplifiers and communication circuits
d) Neither amplifiers nor communication circuits
c
