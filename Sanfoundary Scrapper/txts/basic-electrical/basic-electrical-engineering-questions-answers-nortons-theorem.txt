b) 11 ohm
c) 12 ohm
d) 13 ohm
c
RN=(3||6)+10 = 12 ohm.

If we apply source transformation between the 6 ohm resistor and the 1A source, we get a 6V source in series with a 6 ohm resistor. Now we have two meshes. Let us consider I1 flowing in the first mesh and I2 flowing in the second mesh.
The mesh equations are:
9I1-6I2=4
-6I1+16I2=6
On solving these equations simultaneously, we get I2=0.72A, which is the short circuit current.
9. Find the current in the 5 ohm resistance using Norton’s theorem.
a) 1A
b) 1.5A
c) 0.25A
d) 0.5A
d
RN=(3||6)+10 = 12 ohm.
Since the 5 ohm is the load resistance, we short it and find the resistance through the short.
If we apply source transformation between the 6 ohm resistor and the 1A source, we get a 6V source in series with a 6 ohm resistor. Now we have two meshes. Let us consider I1 flowing in the first mesh and I2 flowing in the second mesh.
The mesh equations are:
9I1-6I2=4
-6I1+16I2=6
On solving these equations simultaneously, we get I2=0.72A, which is the short circuit current.
Connecting the current source in parallel to RN which is in turn connected in parallel to the load resistance=5ohm, we get Norton’s equivalent circuit.
Using current divider: I = 0.72*12/(12+5) = 0.5 A.
