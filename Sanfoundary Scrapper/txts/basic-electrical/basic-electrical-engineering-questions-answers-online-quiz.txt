5. A laminated steel ring is wound with 200 turns. When the magnetizing current varies between 5 and 7 A, the magnetic flux varies between 760 and 800 Wb. Calculate the inductance of the coil.
a) 40H
b) 4 H
c) 4000H
d) 0.004 H
c
L=(Change in flux/Change in current)*Number of turns
Substituting the values from the given question, we get L = 4000 H.
6. Calculate the number of turns in an inductor with a ferromagnetic core when the inductance is 4000 H, the current changes from 5A to 7A and the flux changes from 760 to 800 Wb.
a) 100
b) 200
c) 300
d) 400
b
L=(Change in flux/Change in current)*Number of turns
Substituting the values from the given question, we get N=200.
7. Calculate the change in current in an inductor having inductance 4000H, number of turns is 200 and the flux changes from 760 to 800 Wb.
a) 2A
b) 4A
c) 6A
d) 8A
a
L=(Change in flux/Change in current)*Number of turns
Substituting the values from the given question, we get a change in current = 2A.
8. Calculate the initial current in an inductor having inductance 4000 H, number of turns is 200 and the flux changes from 760 to 800 Wb. Current changes to 7A.
a) 10A
b) 2A
c) 3A
d) 5A
d
L=(Change in flux/Change in current)*Number of turns
Substituting the values from the given question, we get change in current = 2A.
Change in current = final current- initial current.
2=7-initial current.
Initial current = 5A.
9. Calculate the change in flux of an inductor having inductance 4000 H, number of turns is 200 and the current changes from 5A to 7A.
a) 20 Wb
b) 40 Wb
c) 60 Wb
d) 80 Wb
b
L=(Change in flux/Change in current)*Number of turns
Substituting the values from the given question, we get change in flux = 40 Wb.
10. Calculate the final flux in an inductor having inductance 4000 H, number of turns is 200 and the current changes from 5A to 7A. The initial flux is 760 Wb.
a) 200 Wb
b) 400 Wb
c) 600 Wb
d) 800 Wb
d
L=(Change in flux/Change in current)*Number of turns
Substituting the values from the given question, we get a change in flux = 40 Wb.
Change in flux = final flux- initial flux.
Thus final flux = 800 Wb.
