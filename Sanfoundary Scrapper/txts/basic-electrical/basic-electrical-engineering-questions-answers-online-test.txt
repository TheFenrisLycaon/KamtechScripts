1. As the number of turns in the coil increases, what happens to the inductance of the coil?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
a
2. What happens to the inductance when the magnetic field strength decreases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
3. What happens to the inductance when the current in the coil becomes double its original value?
a) Becomes half
b) Becomes four times
c) Becomes double
d) Remains same
d
Φ=Li where L is constant of proportionality
So, when current get double ϕ  also becomes double keeping L same.
4. When the coil is wrapped around a ferromagnetic core, why is it difficult to determine the inductance?
a) The variation of flux is no longer proportional to the variation of current
b) Current does not exist in the coil
c) Flux does not exist in the coil
d) The value of current is too large to measure
a
5. What happens to the inductance as the area of the cross section of the coil increases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
a
6. What happens to the inductance as the length of the magnetic circuit increases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
7. If the current changes from 20A to 10A in 5 seconds and the value of inductance is 1H, calculate the emf induced.
a) 8V
b) 6V
c) 4V
d) 2V
d
emf=L(i2-i1)/t
Substituting the values from the question we get emf=2V.
