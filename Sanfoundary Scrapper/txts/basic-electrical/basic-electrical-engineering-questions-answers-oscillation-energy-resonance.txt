1. The energy stored in the capacitor is of _________ nature.
a) Electrostatic
b) Magnetic
c) Neither electrostatic nor magnetic
d) Either electrostatic or magnetic
a
2. The energy stored in the inductor is of _________ nature.
a) Electrostatic
b) Magnetic
c) Neither electrostatic nor magnetic
d) Either electrostatic or magnetic
b
3. At resonance, the circuit appears __________
a) Inductive
b) Capacitive
c) Either inductive or capacitive
d) Resistive
d
4. At resonance, the capacitive energy is ___________ inductive energy.
a) Greater than
b) Less than
c) Equal to
d) Depends on the circuit
c
5. At resonance, electrostatic energy is ___________ the magnetic energy.
a) Greater than
b) Less than
c) Equal to
d) Depends on the circuit
c
6. The maximum magnetic energy stored in an inductor at any instance is?
a) E=LIm2/2
b) E=LIm/2
c) E=LIm2
d) E=LIm2*2
a
7. The maximum electrostatic energy stored in a capacitor at any instance is?
a) CVm2
b) 1/2*CVm2
c) CVm
d) CVm/2
b
8. Q is the ratio of?
a) Active power to reactive power
b) Reactive power to active power
c) Reactive power to average power
d) Reactive power to capacitive power
c
9. Find the value of Q if the reactive power is 10W and the average power is 5W.
a) 10
b) 5
c) 2
d) 1
c
Q = Reactive power / Average power = 10/5 = 2.
10. Find the reactive power when the average power is 5W and Q=2.
a) 10W
b) 5W
c) 2W
d) 1W
a
Q = Reactive power / Average power
2 = Reactive power / 5
Reactive Power = 2*5 = 10W.
