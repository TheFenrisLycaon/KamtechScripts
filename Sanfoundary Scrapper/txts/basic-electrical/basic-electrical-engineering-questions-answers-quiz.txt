1. Permeability of free space is also known as _________
a) Magnetic constant
b) Electric constant
c) Electrostatic constant
d) Magnetostatic constant
a
2. A substance whose permeability is less than the permeability of free space is?
a) Diamagnetic
b) Paramagnetic
c) Ferromagnetic
d) Not a magnetic substance
a
3. Which, among the following, have negative susceptibility?
a) Diamagnetic
b) Paramagnetic
c) Ferromagnetic
d) Not a magnetic substance
a
4. Which, among the following, have positive susceptibility?
a) Diamagnetic
b) Paramagnetic
c) Ferromagnetic
d) Both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic
d
5. A substance whose permeability is more than the permeability of free space is?
a) Diamagnetic
b) Paramagnetic
c) Ferromagnetic
d) Both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic
d
Since both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials have positive susceptibility, their relative permeability is greater than unity i.e. their permeability is more than the permeability of free space.
6. The unit for permeability of free space is?
a) Henry
b) Henry-m
c) Henry/m
d) Henry/m2
c
We get unit of µ0 = Henry/m.
7. Which among the following, is a correct expression for µ0.
a) µ0=BH
b) µ0=B/H
c) µ0=H/B
d) µ0=BH2
b
8. Calculate the magnetic flux density if the magnetic field strength is 2A/m.
a) 4*pi*10-7T
b) 8*pi*10-7T
c) 10*pi*10-7T
d) 12*pi*10-7T
b
µ0=B/H
Substituting the value of H from the question, we get B = 8*pi*10-7T.
9. Calculate the magnetic field strength if the magnetic flux density is 4*piT.
a) 10-7/16*pi2A/m
b) 10-7A/m
c) 107A/m
d) 10-7A
c
µ0=B/H
Substituting the value of B from the question, we get H = 107A/m.
10. Calculate the magnetic flux density if the magnetic field strength is 3A/m.
a) 4*pi*10-7T
b) 8*pi*10-7T
c) 10*pi*10-7T
d) 12*pi*10-7T
d
µ0=B/H
Substituting the value of H from the question, we get B = 12*pi*10-7T.
