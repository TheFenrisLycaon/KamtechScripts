1. What is the unit for relative permeability?
a) H-m
b) H/m
c) H2/m
d) No unit
d
2. Which of the following expressions is correct with respect to relative permeability?
a) B = µrµ0/H
b) B = µrµ0H
c) B = µr/µ0H
d) B = µrµ0/H2
b
3. A substance whose relative permeability is less than the permeability of free space is?
a) Diamagnetic
b) Paramagnetic
c) Ferromagnetic
d) Not a magnetic substance
a
4. A substance whose relative permeability is more than the permeability of free space is?
a) Diamagnetic
b) Paramagnetic
c) Ferromagnetic
d) Both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic
d
Since both paramagnetic and ferromagnetic materials have positive susceptibility, their relative permeability is greater than unity i.e. their permeability is more than the permeability of free space.
5. Diamagnetic substances have relative permeability_____________
a) Greater than 1
b) Less than 1
c) Equal to 1
d) Zero
b
6. Paramagnetic substances have relative permeability_____________
a) Greater than 1
b) Less than 1
c) Equal to 1
d) Zero
a
7. As the temperature increases up to the Curie temperature, the relative susceptibility of ferromagnetic materials?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains constant
d) Becomes zero
a
8. As the temperature increases beyond the Curie temperature, the relative susceptibility of ferromagnetic materials?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains constant
d) Becomes zero
b
