1. In order to obtain a high value for capacitance, the permittivity of the dielectric medium should be?
a) Low
b) High
c) Zero
d) Unity
b
C=epsilon*A/d.
From this expression, it is seen that capacitance is directly proportional to the permittivity, hence for capacitance value to be high, permittivity value should be high.
2. Find the capacitance of a capacitor whose area of cross section of the plates is 4m2 and distance of separation between the plates is 2m. The capacitor is placed in vacuum.
a) 1.77*10-11F
b) 1.34*10-11F
c) 2.33*10-11F
d) 5.65*10-11F
a
C=epsilon*A/d.
The medium is free space hence, epsilon = 8.85*10-12.
Therefore, C=8.85*10-12*4/2 = 1.77*10-12F = 1.77*10-11F.
3. What is relative permittivity?
a) Equal to the absolute permittivity
b) Ratio of actual permittivity to absolute permittivity
c) Ratio of absolute permittivity to actual permittivity
d) Equal to the actual permittivity
b
4. What happens to relative permittivity when actual permittivity decreases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
5. What is the relative permittivity when the actual permittivity is 4F/m?
a) 4.57*10-11
b) 4.57*1012
c) 4.57*1011
d) 4.57*10-12
c
Relative permittivity = 4/(8.85*10-12) = 4.57*1011.
6. What happens to absolute permittivity when relative permittivity increases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
c
7. Calculate the actual permittivity of a medium whose relative permittivity is 5.
a) 4.43*10-11F/m
b) 4.43*10-12F/m
c) 4.43*1011F/m
d) 4.43*1012F/m
a
Actual permittivity = 5*8.85*10-12 = 4.43*10-11F/m.
8. What is the unit for relative permittivity?
a) F/m
b) Fm
c) F/m2
d) No unit
d
9. Which, among the following, will be unity in free space?
a) Absolute permittivity
b) Relative permittivity
c) Actual permittivity
d) Both absolute and relative permittivity
b
10. Which, among the following, do not have any unit?
a) Absolute permittivity
b) Relative permittivity
c) Actual permittivity
d) Both absolute and relative permittivity
b
