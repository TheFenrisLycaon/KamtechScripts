1. Reciprocal of reluctance is __________
a) Permeance
b) Susceptibility
c) Resistance
d) Conductance
a
2. Reluctance is ________________ to the length of the material.
a) Directly proportional
b) Inversely proportional
c) Not related
d) Reluctance is ________________ to the length of the material.
a
S = l/µ0 µr*A.
From the formula, we can see that reluctance is directly proportional to the length of the material.
3. Reluctance is ________________ to the area of cross section the material.
a) Directly proportional
b) Inversely proportional
c) Not related
d) Equal
b
S = l/(µ0 µr*A).
From the formula, we can see that reluctance is inversely proportional to the area of cross section of the material.
4. When the length of the material increases, what happens to reluctance?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
a
5. When the area of cross section of the material increases, what happens to reluctance?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
6. Unit of reluctance is?
a) AWb
b) A2/Wb
c) Wb/A
d) A/Wb
d
So unit of reluctance = unit of MMF / unit of magnetic flux = A/Wb.
7. The electrical equivalent of reluctance is?
a) Resistance
b) Inductance
c) Capacitance
d) Conductance
a
8. As the magnetic field strength increases, reluctance?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
a
9. As the magnetic flux density increases, the reluctance _____________
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
b
10. Calculate the reluctance when the magnetomotive force is 10A turns and the flux is 5Wb.
a) 0.5A/Wb
b) 5A/Wb
c) 10A/Wb
d) 2A/Wb
d
F=ϕ*S
Substituting the given values from the question:
S=2A/Wb.
