1. For addition and subtraction of phasors, we use the _________ form.
a) Rectangular
b) Polar
c) Either rectangular or polar
d) Neither rectangular nor polar
a
2. For multiplication and division of phasors, we use ____________ form.
a) Rectangular
b) Polar
c) Either rectangular or polar
d) Neither rectangular nor polar
b
3. If a voltage of 2+5j and another voltage of 3+ 6j flows through two different resistors, connected in series, in a circuit, find the total voltage in the circuit.
a) 2+5j V
b) 3+6j V
c) 5+11j V
d) 5+10j V
c
Therefore, Vtotal= 5+11j V.
4. Find the total current in the circuit if two currents of 4+5j flow in the circuit.
a) 4+5j A
b) 4A
c) 5A
d) 8+10j A
d
Therefore, Itotal= 8+10j A.
5. What is the correct expression of ω?
a) ω=2π
b) ω=2πf
c) ω=πf
d) ω=2f2
b
6. Find the value of ω if the frequency is 5Hz?
a) 3.14 rad/s
b) 31.4 rad/s
c) 34 rad/s
d) 341 rad/s
b
Substituting the value of f from the question, we get ω=31.4 rad/s.
7. When one sine wave passes through the zero following the other, it is _________
a) Leading
b) Lagging
c) Neither leading nor lagging
d) Either leading or lagging
b
8. A phasor has frozen at 30 degrees, find the value of the phase angle.

b
10. The length of the phasor represents?
a) Magnitude of the quantity
b) Direction of the quantity
c) Neither magnitude nor direction
d) Either magnitude or direction
a
