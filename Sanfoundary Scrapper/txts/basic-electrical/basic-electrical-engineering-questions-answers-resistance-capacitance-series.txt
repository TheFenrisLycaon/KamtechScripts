1. If in an alternating current circuit, resistance is 5 ohm, capacitive reactance is 12 ohm, what is the impedance?
a) 5 ohm
b) 10 ohm
c) 12 ohm
d) 13 ohm
d
Z2=R2+XC2  Substituting the values we get,
Z2 = 52 + 122
Z2 = 169
Z=13 Ω.
2. If in an alternating current circuit, impedance is 26 ohm, capacitive reactance is 24 ohm, what is the resistance?
a) 25 ohm
b) 10 ohm
c) 12 ohm
d) 23 ohm
b
Z2=R2+XC2  Substituting the values we get,
262 = R2 + 242
676 = R2 + 576
R2 = 100
R=10 Ω.

d
Z2 = 52 + 122
Z2 = 169
Z=13 Ω.
I = V/Z = 260/13=20 A.
VR=iR=20*5=100 V.
