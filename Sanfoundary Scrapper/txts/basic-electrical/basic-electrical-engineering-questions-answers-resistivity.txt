b) Conductors
c) Dielectrics
d) Semi-conductors
b

a) Both have equal resistance
b) The 2m wire has higher resistance
c) The 5m wire has higher resistance
d) The value of resistance cannot be determined from the given data
c
3. A wire having an area of cross section = 10sqm and another wire having an area of cross section= 15sqm, have the same length and are made up of the same material. Which wire has more resistance?
a) Both have equal resistance
b) The 10sqm wire has higher resistance
c) The 15sqm wire has higher resistance
d) The value of resistance cannot be determined from the given data
b
4. Which of the following statements are true with regard to resistance?
a) Resistance is directly proportional to a length of the wire
b) Resistance is directly proportional to an area of cross section of the wire
c) Resistance is inversely proportional to the length of the wire
d) Resistance is inversely proportional to the resistivity of the wire
a
5. A wire has the same resistance as the one given in the figure. Calculate its resistivity if the length of the wire is 10m and its area of cross section is 2m.
a) 16 ohm-metre
b) 8 ohm-metre
c) 16 kiloohm-metre
d) 8 kiloohm-metre
b
Resistivity= Resistance*Area of cross section/ Length of the wire.
Resistivity= 40*2/10= 8 ohm-metre.
6. Which, among the following is a unit for resistivity?
a) ohm/metre
b) ohm/metre2
c) ohm-metre
d) ohm-metre2
c
Unit of resistivity = ohm*(m2)/m = ohm-m.
7. What is the resistivity of Copper?
a) 1.59*10-8ohm-m
b) 2.7*10-8ohm-m
c) 7.3*10-8ohm-m
d) 5.35*10-8ohm-m
a
8. Calculate the ratio of the resistivity of 2 wires having the same length and same resistance with area of cross section 2m2 and 5m2 respectively.
a) 5:7
b) 2:7
c) 2:5
d) 7:5
c
Since resistance and length of the two wires are same so resistivity is directly proportional to area of cross section. Ratio of area is 2:5 so the ratio of resistivity is also 2:5.
9. Which of the following statements are true with regard to resistivity?
a) Resistance depends on the temperature
b) Resistance does not depend on the temperature
c) Resistivity depend on the length
d) Resistivity depend on area of cross section
a
For the same material with different length and area, resistivity remains the same until temperature remains constant.
10. The reciprocal of resistivity is________
a) Conductance
b) Resistance
c) Conductivity
d) Impedance
c
