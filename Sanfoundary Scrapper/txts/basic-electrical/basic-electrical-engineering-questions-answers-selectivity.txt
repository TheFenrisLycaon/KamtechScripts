1. Shape of the resonance curve depends upon the?
a) Q-factor
b) Voltage
c) Current
d) Either voltage or current
a
Q=Resonance frequency / Bandwidth.                                                                                                            Sharp resonance means high quality factor.
2. A circuit is said to be selective if it has a _____ peak and ____ bandwidth.
a) Blunt, narrow
b) Sharp, narrow
c) Sharp, broad
d) Blunt, broad
b
3. What is the Q factor of a selective circuit?
a) Very low
b) Very high
c) Zero
