1. A voltage source connected in series with a resistor can be converted to a?
a) Current source in series with a resistor
b) Current source in parallel with a resistor
c) Voltage source in parallel with a resistor
d) Cannot be modified
b
2. Calculate the total current in the circuit.
a) 2.3mA
b) 4.3mA
c) 3.3mA
d) 1.3mA
c
I=(45-3)/(5+4.7+3) = 3.3mA.
3. Find the value of voltage once source transformation is applied to the circuit.
a) 10V
b) 30V
c) 50V
d) 70V
c
Thus V=10*5 = 50V.
4. Once the circuit is transformed to a voltage source where will the resistance be connected?
a) In series with the voltage source
b) In parallel with the voltage source
c) The resistance is removed from the circuit
d) Resistance is multiplied by 10 and connected in series with the source
a
5. What will the value of the current be once source transformation is applied to the circuit?
a) 10A
b) 20A
c) 30A
d) 40A
a
Thus I=V/R.
I=220/22=10A.
6. Once the circuit is transformed into a current source where will the resistance be connected?
a) In series with the current source
b) In parallel with the current source
c) The resistance is removed from the circuit
d) Resistance is multiplied by 10 and connected in parallel with the source
b
7. A current source connected in parallel with a resistor can be converted to a?
a) Current source in series with a resistor
b) Voltage source in series with a resistor
c) Voltage source in parallel with a resistor
d) Cannot be modified
b
8. A source transformation is_________
a) Unilateral
b) Bilateral
c) Unique
d) Cannot be determined
b
9. In source transformation________
a) Voltage source remains the same
b) Current sources remain the same
c) Both voltage and current source remain the same
d) Resistances remain the same
d
10. If there are 3 10V sources connected in parallel then on source transformation__________
a) The effect of all the sources is considered
b) The effect of only one source is considered
c) The effect of none of the sources is considered
d) The effect of only 2 sources is considered.
b
