1. Calculate the Thevenin resistance across the terminal AB for the following circuit.
a) 4.34 ohm
b) 3.67 ohm
c) 3.43 ohm
d) 2.32 ohm
b
When the 10V source is shorted, we get:
Rth=(1||2)+3=3.67 ohm.
2. Calculate Vth for the given circuit.
a) 5.54V
b) 3.33V
c) 6.67V
d) 3.67V
c
3. Calculate the current across the 4 ohm resistor.
a) 0.86A
b) 1.23A
c) 2.22A
d) 0.67A
a
When the 10V source is shorted, we get:
Rth=(1||2)+3=3.67 ohm.
Vth is calculated by opening the specified terminal.
Using voltage divider, Vth= 2*10/(2+1)=6.67V.
On drawing the Thevenin equivalent circuit, we get Rth, 4 ohm and Vth in series.
Applying Ohm’s law, I=Vth/(4+Rth) = 0.86A.
