1. A CR network is one which consists of _________
a) A capacitor and resistor connected in parallel
b) A capacitor and resistor connected in series
c) A network consisting of a capacitor only
d) A network consisting of a resistor only
b
2. At DC, capacitor acts as _________
a) Open circuit
b) Short circuit
c) Resistor
d) Inductor
a
For DC, f=0 so, XC becomes infinite. Hence for dc, the capacitor acts as an open circuit.
3. In an RC series circuit, when the switch is closed and the circuit is complete, what is the response?
a) Response does not vary with time
b) Decays with time
c) Increases with time
d) First increases, then decrease
b
4. If the switch is closed at t=0, what is the current in the circuit?
a) 0A
b) 10A
c) 20A
d) Infinity
b
I=V/R = 100/10 = 10A.
5. Calculate the voltage across the capacitor at t=0.
a) 0V
b) 10V
c) 20V
d) Infinity
a
6. Calculate di(0)/dt if the switch is closed at t=0.
a) -9.9A/s
b) -10A/s
c) 0A/s
d) -0.1A/s
d
i=i0e-t/RC = (100/10)e-t/100
i=10 e-t/100
di/dt = -(10/100) e-t/100
di(0)/dt=-0.1A/s.
7. Calculate d2i(0)/dt2 from the given circuit.
a) 10-6A/s2
b) 10-3A/s2
c) 106A/s2
d) 103A/s2
b
100+10i(0)+1/10*integral(i(0)dt)=0
Differentiating once, we get:
10di(0)/dt+1/10*i.
Differentiating once again, we get:
10d2i(0)/dt2+10di(0)/dt=0.
Substituting the values of di/dt from the previous explanation, we get d2i(0)/dt2=10-3A/s2.
8. The current equation for the given circuit is?
a) i=10e(-0.01)t A
b) i=10e(0.01)t A
c) i=10e(-0.001)t A
d) i=100e(-0.01)t A
a
100+10i(0)+1/10*integral(i(0)dt)=0
On applying Laplace transform to this equation, we get:
100/s=I(s)/10s+10I(s)
Solving the equation, we get:
i=10e(-0.01)t A.
9. The expression for the current in an RC circuit is?
a) i=(V/R)et/RC
b) i=(V/R)e-t/RC
c) i=(V/R)(1-e-t/RC)
d) i=(V/R) (1-et/RC)
b
i=i0e-t/RC = (100/10)e-t/100
i=10 e-t/100.
10. What is the voltage in the resistor as soon as the switch is closed at t=0.
a) 0V
b) Infinity
c) 220V
d) Insufficient information provided
c
