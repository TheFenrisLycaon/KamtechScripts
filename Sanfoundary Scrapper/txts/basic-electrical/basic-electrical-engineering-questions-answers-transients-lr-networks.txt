1. An RL network is one which consists of ____________
a) Resistor and capacitor in parallel
b) Resistor and capacitor in series
c) Resistor and inductor in parallel
d) Resistor and inductor in series
d
2. If the switch is opened at t=0, what is the current in the circuit?
a) 0A
b) 1A
c) 2A
d) 3A
c
Current in inductor doesn’t change suddenly so when switch is opened, current in inductor remains same i.e. 2A.
3. In an RL series circuit, when the switch is closed and the circuit is complete, what is the response?
a) Response does not vary with time
b) Decays with time
c) Increases with time
d) First increases, then decrease
b
4. If the switch is closed at t=0, what is the current in the circuit?
a) 0A
b) 10A
c) 20A
d) 30A
a
5. What is the voltage across the inductor at t=0?
a) 0V
b) 20V
c) 60V
d) 58V
c
6. What is the expression for current in the given circuit?
a) i=2(e-2t)A
b) i=2(1-e-2t)A
c) i=2(e2t)A
d) i=2(1+e-2t)A
b
60-30i-15di/dt =0
i=2(1-e-2t)A
7. What is the expression for voltage in the given circuit?
a) V=60e-0.5t
b) V=30e-0.5t
c) V=60e-2t
d) V=30e-2t
c
60-30i-15di/dt = 0
i=2(1-e-2t)A
di/dt = 4e-2t
V=Ldi/dt=15*4e--2t=60e-2t.
8. At steady state, the current in the inductor is?
a) Maximum
b) Minimum
c) Zero
d) Infinity
a
9. Initially, when the switch in a series RL circuit is closed, the inductor acts as?
a) Open circuit
b) Short circuit
c) Resistor
d) Capacitor
a
10. Initially, when the switch in a series RL circuit is closed, the current in the inductor is?
a) Maximum
b) Minimum
c) Zero
d) Infinity
c
