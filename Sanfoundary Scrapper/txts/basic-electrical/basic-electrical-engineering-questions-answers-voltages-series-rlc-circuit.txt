7. The current in the inductor lags the voltage in a series RLC circuit ___________ resonant frequency.
a) Above
b) Below
c) Equal to
d) Depends on the circuit
a
8. The current in the capacitor leads the voltage in a series RLC circuit ___________ resonant frequency.
a) Above
b) Below
c) Equal to
d) Depends on the circuit
b
ωL < 1/ωC   => ω < 1/√LC  => ω < ω0.                                                                                                                                   So, the current in the capacitor leads the voltage in a series RLC circuit below the resonant frequency.
9. The current in the inductor ___________ the voltage in a series RLC circuit above the resonant frequency.
a) Leads
b) Lags
c) Equal to
d) Depends on the circuit
b
=> ωL > 1/ωC   =>  XL > XC
The circuit is inductive dominant so, the current in the inductor lags the voltage in a series RLC circuit above the resonant frequency.
10. The current in the capacitor ___________ the voltage in a series RLC circuit below the resonant frequency.
a) Leads
b) Lags
c) Equal to
d) Depends on the circuit
a
=> ωL < 1/ωC   =>  XL < XC                                                                                                                                                                                                             The circuit is capacitive dominant so, the current in the capacitor leads the voltage in a series RLC circuit above the resonant frequency.
