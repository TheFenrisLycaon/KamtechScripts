c) Instantaneous value
d) Period
d
3. The repetition of a variable quantity, recurring at equal intervals, is known as ___________
a) Waveform
b) Instantaneous value
c) Cycle
d) Period
c
4. The value of a given waveform at any instant time is termed as ___________
a) Waveform
b) Instantaneous value
c) Cycle
d) Period
b
5. The maximum instantaneous value measured from zero value is known as?
a) Peak value
b) Peak to peak value
c) Cycle
d) Period
a
6. The maximum variation between the maximum positive and the maximum negative value is known as?
a) Peak value
b) Peak to peak value
c) Cycle
d) Period
b
7. What is the correct relation between the peak value and peak to peak value for a sinusoidal waveform?
a) Vp=4Vp-p
b) Vp=Vp-p
c) Vp-p=2Vp
d) Vp=2Vp-p
c
8. If the peak to peak voltage is 10V, calculate the peak voltage.
a) 10V
b) 2V
c) 4V
d) 5V
d
Substituting the values from the question, we get Vp=5V.
9. If the peak voltage is 9V, calculate the peak to peak voltage.
a) 9V
b) 20V
c) 18V
d) 12V
c
Substituting the values from the question, we get Vp-p= 18V.
