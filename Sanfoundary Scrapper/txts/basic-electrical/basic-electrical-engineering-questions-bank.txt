1. The waveform of the emf generated undergoes one complete cycle when?
a) Conductors move past north pole
b) Conductors move past south pole
c) Conductors move past north and south poles
d) Conductors are stationary
c
2. When is the shape of the negative half of the emf waveform equal to the positive half?
a) When the conductors move past north pole
b) When conductors move past south pole
c) When conductors move past both north and south pole
d) When conductors are stationary
c
3. Which is the correct formula for frequency in an ac generator?
a) f=p*n
b) f=p/n
c) f=n/p
d) f=n2p
a
4. What will happen to the frequency if the number of revolutions increases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
a
f=p*n, therefore, as n increases, f also increases.
Hence frequency increases if number of revolutions increases.
5. What happens to the frequency if the number of pairs of poles increases?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains the same
d) Becomes zero
a
f=p*n, therefore, as p increases, f also increases.
Hence frequency increases if number of pair of poles increases.
6. Calculate the frequency if the number of revolutions is 300 and the paired poles are 50.
a) 15kHz
b) 150kHz
c) 1500kHz
d) 150Hz
a
f=50*300=15000 Hz = 15kHz.
7. Calculate the number of revolutions if the frequency is 15kHz and the paired poles are 50.
a) 100
b) 200
c) 300
d) 400
c
f=15kHz=15000Hz, p=50
15000=50*n => n=15000/50=300.
8. Calculate the number of paired poles if the frequency id 15kHz and the number of revolutions is 300.
a) 10
b) 30
c) 50
d) 70
c
f=15kHz=15000Hz, n=300
15000=p*300 =>  p=15000/300=50.
9. What is the frequency of a two pole machine having n=50?
a) 100Hz
b) 200Hz
c) 50Hz
d) 25Hz
c
f=pn = 1*50 = 50Hz.
10. What is the minimum number of poles that a machine must have __________
a) 1
b) 2
c) 4
d) 10
b
