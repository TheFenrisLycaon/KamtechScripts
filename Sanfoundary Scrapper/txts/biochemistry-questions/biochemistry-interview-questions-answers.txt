1. What is the concentration of OH– in a solution with a H+ concentration of 1.3×10-4 M?
a) 7.7×10-10  M
b) 7.7×10-9  M
c) 7.7×10-11  M
d) 7.7×10-12  M
c
Solving for [OH–]  gives
     [OH–]=(Kw)/([H+]) = (1.0 X 10-14)/(1.3 X 10-4) M
                           = 7.7 × 10-11  M.
2. Identify the triprotic acid from the following.
a) Carbonic acid
b) Bicarbonate
c) Glycine
d) Phosphoric acid
d
 
3. Which of the following acids has the lowest pKa value?
a) Acetic acid
b) Sulphuric acid
c) Dil.HCl
d) Oxalic acid
b
4. Which of the following bases has the highest pKa value?
a) NaOH
b) NaNO3
c) KNO3
d) KCl
a
5. The degree of ionization does not depend on?
a) Temperature
b) Current
c) Nature of solvent
d) Concentration
b
6. The hydrolysis constant of CH3COONa is given by ____________
a) Kh = Kw/Ka
b) Kh = Kw/Kb
c) Kh = Kw/Ka×Kb
d) Kh =  Ka +  Kb
a
7. K1 and K2 for oxalic acid are 6.5×10-2and 6.1×10-5respectively. What will be the [OH–] in a 0.01M solution of sodium oxalate?
a) 9.6×10-6
b) 1.4×10-1
c) 1.2×10-6
d) 1.3×10-8
c
  C2 O42-+ H2 O → HC2O4- + OH–
8. If pKb for fluoride at 25°c is 10.83, the ionization constant of hydrofluoric acid in water at this temperature is?
a) 3.52×10-3
b) 6.75×10-4
c) 5.38×10-2
d) 1.74×10-5
b
Ka = Kw / Kb
Ka = 10-14/-log (10.83) = 6.75 × 10-4.
9. Aqueous solution of the detergents are _________
a) Neutral
b) Acidic
c) Basic
d) Amphoteric
c
10. If pH of solution of NaOH is 12.0 the pH of H2 SO4 solution of same molarity will be?
a) 2.0
b) 12.0
c) 1.7
d) 10.0387
c
[OH–] = 10-2
Molarity of NaOH = 10-2
For H2 SO4, molarity = 10-2
[H+] = 2 × 10-2
pH = 2 – log2 = 1.7.
