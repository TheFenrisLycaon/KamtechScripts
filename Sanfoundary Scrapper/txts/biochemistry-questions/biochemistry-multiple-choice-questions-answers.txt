b) It codes for a GTPase switch protein, which in its mutated form cannot be switched off
c) It codes for a transcription factor produced abnormally in large amounts
d) A growth factor that is continually active is encoded in its truncated form
b
6. Which property of p53 enables it to prevent the development of cancer?
a) It is a transcription factor that causes protein production which stimulates the cell cycle
b) It prevents replication of cells with damaged DNA
c) It prevents cells from triggering apoptosis
d) It stimulates synthesis of DNA repair enzymes that replace telomere sequence lost during cell division
b
7. The characteristic of malignant other than a benign tumor is?
a) Undergoes metastasis
b) Develops blood supply
c) Cell divides an unlimited number of times
d) Grows without needing a growth signal
a
8. The mutation which cannot give rise to an oncogene?
a) Addition or deletion of a base producing a nonsense message and an inactive protein product
b) A point mutation changing just one amino acid in protein product
c) A translocation, putting gene under control of strong promoter producing over expression
d) A point mutation producing stop codon, premature termination
a
9. Which of the following about Rb tumor suppressor protein is correct?

b) It is activated when phosphorylated by Cdk
c) It is a transcription factor
d) When a mitogenic signal is received, it binds the transcription factor E2F and thus stimulates the cell to enter S phase
