1. Which of the following involves remarkable capacity of a short segment of DNA to move from one place to another?
a) DNA transposition
b) DNA replication
c) Translation
d) Transcription
a
2. Which of the following process occurs between DNA molecules of very similar sequences?
a) Homologous genetic recombination
b) Site specific recombination
c) Non-homologous recombination
d) Replicative recombination
a
Site-specific recombination occurs between particular short sequences present on otherwise dissimilar parental molecules. Replicative recombination generates a new copy of the transposable element at a new location of DNA.
3. Which of the following process occurs in regions where no large –scale sequence similarity is apparent?
a) Homologous genetic recombination
b) Site specific recombination
c) Non-homologous recombination
d) Replicative recombination
c
Replicative recombination generates a new copy of the transposable element at a new location of DNA.
Homologous genetic recombination occurs between DNA molecules of very similar sequences.
4. Which of the following process generates a new copy of the transposable element at a new location of DNA?

d) Replicative recombination
d
Site-specific recombination occurs between particular short sequences present on otherwise dissimilar parental molecules.
Non-homologous recombination occurs in regions where no large –scale sequence similarity is apparent.
