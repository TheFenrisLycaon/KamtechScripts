1. Which of the following is true about Michaelis-Menten kinetics?

b) It describes single substrate enzymes
c) Km, the Michaelis constant is defined as the dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex
d) It assumes covalent binding occurs between enzyme and substrate
b
2. When the velocity of enzyme activity is plotted against substrate concentration, which of the following is obtained?
a) Hyperbolic curve
b) Parabola
c) Straight line with positive slope
d) Straight line with negative slope
a
3. Which of the following is the correct Line weaver-Burk equation?
a) \(\frac{1}{V_0} = \frac{K_m}{V_{max} [S]} + \frac{1}{V_{max}} \) 
b) \(\frac{1}{V_{max}} = \frac{K_m}{V_0 [S]} + \frac{1}{V_0} \) 
c) \(V_0 = \frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m+[S]} \) 
d) \(V_{max} = \frac{V_0⁡ [S]}{K_m+[S]} \) 
a
Line weaver-Burk equation: \(\frac{1}{V_0} = \frac{K_m}{V_{max} [S]} + \frac{1}{V_{max}} \) 
Michaelis-Menten equation: \(V_0 = \frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m+[S]} \) 
4. Which of the following statements is true about competitive inhibitors?
a) It is a common type of irreversible inhibition
b) In the presence of a competitive inhibitor, the Michaelis-Menten equation becomes
\(V_0 = \frac{V_{max} [S]}{α K_m+[S]} \) 
c) The apparent Km decreases in the presence of inhibitor by a factor α
d) The maximum velocity for the reaction decreases in the presence of a competitive inhibitor
b
The apparent Km increases in the presence of inhibitor by a factor α.
The maximum velocity for the reaction remains same in the presence of a competitive inhibitor.
5. Which of the following statements is true about uncompetitive inhibitors?
a) They bind covalently at a site distinct from the substrate active site
b) In the presence of a uncompetitive inhibitor, the Michaelis-Menten equation becomes
\(V_0 = \frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m+α’ [S]} \) 
c) They increase the measured Vmax⁡
d) Apparent Km also increases
b
They decrease the measured Vmax⁡ and also apparent Km.

b) Product formation
c) Size of the enzymes
d) pH of optimum value
a
12. What is the general mechanism of an enzyme?
