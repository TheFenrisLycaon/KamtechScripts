1. Which of the following is a hypertonic solution?
a) Oceans
b) Freshwater habitats
c) 0.45% sodium chloride
d) Red blood cells placed in fresh water
a
2. If pH of solution of NaOH is 12.0 the pH of H2SO4 solution of same molarity will be ____________
a) 2.0
b) 12.0
c) 1.7
d) 10.0387
c
[OH–] = 10-2
Molarity of NaOH = 10-2
For H2SO4, molarity = 10-2
[H+] = 2 × 10-2
pH = 2 – log2 = 1.7.

a) Not a buffer solution with pH < 7
b) Not a buffer solution with pH > 7
c) A buffer solution with pH < 7
d) A buffer solution with pH > 7
a
4. What does it mean when we say that water acts as a “heat buffer”?
a) It keeps the temperature of an organism relatively constant as the temperature of the surroundings fluctuates
b) It increases the temperature of an organism as the temperature of the surroundings increases
c) It decreases the temperature of an organism as the temperature of the surroundings increases
d) It increases the temperature of an organism as the temperature of the surroundings decreases
a
5. What trend does the reactivity of group II elements follow with water?
a) Increases down the group
b) Decreases down the group
c) Does not follow any particular trend
d) No reaction
