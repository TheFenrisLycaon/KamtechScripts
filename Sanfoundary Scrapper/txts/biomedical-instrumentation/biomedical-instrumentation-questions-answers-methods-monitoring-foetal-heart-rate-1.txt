8. The transmittance of interference filters varies between ________ % with a spectral bandwidth of 10 to 15 nm.
a) 15 to 20 %
b) 20 to 60 %
c) 10 to 20 %
d) 15 to 60 %
d
9. The expression relating the wavelength of the radiation and the angle (q) at which it is reflected is given by _________
a) ml = 2d sin q, where l= lambda
b) m = 2d sin q
c) ml = d sin q, where l= lambda
d) m = d sin q
a
ml = 2d sin q, where l= lambda.
where d is the distance separating the grooves and is known as the grating constant and m is the order of interference.
When m = 1, the spectrum is known as first order and with m = 2, the spectrum is known as second order.
10. _______ are optical systems, which provide better isolation of spectral energy than the optical filters.
a) Spectromators
b) Monochromators
c) Tocochromators
d) Baromators
b
