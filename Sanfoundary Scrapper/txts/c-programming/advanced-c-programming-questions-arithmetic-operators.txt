This section on C test focuses on “Arithmetic Operators”. One shall practice these test questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C test questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C test questions on “Arithmetic Operators” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
