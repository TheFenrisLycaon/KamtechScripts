Sanfoundry’s 1000+ Interview Questions & Answers on C helps anyone preparing for Capgemini and other companies C interviews. One should practice these 1000+ interview questions and answers continuously for 2-3 months to clear Capgemini interviews on C Programming language. 
Here is a listing of basic C interview questions on “While Loops” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        char *str = "";        do        {            printf("hello");        } while (str);    }
a) Nothing
b) Run time error
c) Varies
d) Hello is printed infinite times
d
2. What will be the output of the following C code?
#include <stdio.h>void main(){    int i = 0;    while (i < 10)    {        i++;        printf("hi\n");        while (i < 8)         {            i++;            printf("hello\n");        }    }}
a) Hi is printed 8 times, hello 7 times and then hi 2 times
b) Hi is printed 10 times, hello 7 times
c) Hi is printed once, hello 7 times
d) Hi is printed once, hello 7 times and then hi 2 times
d
3. What is an example of iteration in C?
a) for
b) while
c) do-while
d) all of the mentioned
d
4. How many times while loop condition is tested in the following C code snippets, if i is initialized to 0 in both the cases?
while (i < n)         i++;    ————-    do         i++;    while (i <= n);
a) n, n
b) n, n+1
c) n+1, n
d) n+1, n+1
d
5. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        int i = 0;        while (i = 0)            printf("True\n");        printf("False\n");    }
a) True (infinite time)
b) True (1 time) False
c) False
d) Compiler dependent
c
6. What will be the output of the following C code?

a) 5, 5
b) 5, 10
c) 10, 10
