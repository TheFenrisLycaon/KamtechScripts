This section on C interview questions and answers focuses on “Random Number Generation”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C Interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Random Number Generation” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:

    #include <stdio.h>    #include <stdlib.h>    int main()    {        printf("%d\n", rand() % 1000);        return 0;    }
a) Compile time error
