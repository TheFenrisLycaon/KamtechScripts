This section on C interview questions and answers focuses on “Register Variables”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C Interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Register Variables” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        register int i = 10;        int *p = &i;        *p = 11;        printf("%d %d\n", i, *p);    }
a) Depends on whether i is actually stored in machine register
b) 10 10
c) 11 11
d) Compile time error
d

a) True
b) False
c) Depends on the standard
d) None of the mentioned
b
3. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        register static int i = 10;        i = 11;        printf("%d\n", i);    }
a) 10
b) Compile time error
c) Undefined behaviour
d) 11
b
4. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        register auto int i = 10;        i = 11;        printf("%d\n", i);    }
a) 10
b) Compile time error
c) Undefined behaviour
d) 11
b
5. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        register const int i = 10;        i = 11;        printf("%d\n", i);    }
a) 10
b) Compile time error
c) Undefined behaviour
d) 11
b
6. Register storage class can be specified to global variables.
a) True
b) False
c) Depends on the compiler
d) Depends on the standard
b
7. Which among the following is wrong for “register int a;”?
a) Compiler generally ignores the request
b) You cannot take the address of this variable
c) Access time to a is critical
d) None of the mentioned
d
8. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        register int x = 5;        m();        printf("x is %d", x);    }    void m()    {        x++;    }
a) 6
b) 5
c) Junk value
d) Compile time error
d
