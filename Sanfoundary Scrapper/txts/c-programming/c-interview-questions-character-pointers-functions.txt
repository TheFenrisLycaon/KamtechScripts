Sanfoundry’s 1000+ Interview Questions & Answers on C helps anyone preparing for Netapp and other companies C interviews. One should practice these 1000+ interview questions and answers continuously for 2-3 months to clear Netapp interviews on C Programming language. 
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Character Pointers and Functions” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. Comment on the output of the following C code.
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        char *str = "This" //Line 1        char *ptr = "Program\n"; //Line 2        str = ptr; //Line 3        printf("%s, %s\n", str, ptr); //Line 4    }
a) Memory holding “this” is cleared at line 3
b) Memory holding “this” loses its reference at line 3
c) You cannot assign pointer like in Line 3
d) Output will be This, Program
b
2. What type of initialization is needed for the segment “ptr[3] = ‘3’;” to work?
a) char *ptr = “Hello!”;
b) char ptr[] = “Hello!”;
c) both char *ptr = “Hello!”; and char ptr[] = “Hello!”;
d) none of the mentioned
b
3. What is the syntax for constant pointer to address (i.e., fixed pointer address)?
a) const <type> * <name>
b) <type> * const <name>
c) <type> const * <name>
d) none of the mentioned
b
4. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int add(int a, int b)    {        return a + b;    }    int main()    {        int (*fn_ptr)(int, int);        fn_ptr = add;        printf("The sum of two numbers is: %d", (int)fn_ptr(2, 3));    }
a) Compile time error, declaration of a function inside main
b) Compile time error, no definition of function fn_ptr
c) Compile time error, illegal application of statement fn_ptr = add
d) No Run time error, output is 5
d
5. What is the correct way to declare and assign a function pointer?
(Assuming the function to be assigned is "int multi(int, int);")
a) int (*fn_ptr)(int, int) = multi;
b) int *fn_ptr(int, int) = multi;
c) int *fn_ptr(int, int) = &multi;
d) none of the mentioned
a
6. Calling a function f with a an array variable a[3] where a is an array, is equivalent to __________
a) f(a[3])
b) f(*(a + 3))
c) f(3[a])
d) all of the mentioned
d
7. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void f(char *k)    {        k++;        k[2] = 'm';    }    void main()    {        char s[] = "hello";        f(s);        printf("%c\n", *s);    }
a) h
b) e
c) m
d) o;
a
8. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        char s[] = "hello";        s++;        printf("%c\n", *s);    }
a) Compile time error
b) h
c) e
d) o
a
