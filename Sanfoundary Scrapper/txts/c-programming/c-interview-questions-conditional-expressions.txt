Sanfoundry’s 1000+ Interview Questions & Answers on C helps anyone preparing for IBM and other companies C interviews. One should practice these 1000+ interview questions and answers continuously for 2-3 months to clear IBM interviews on C Programming language. 
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Conditional Expressions” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        int k = 8;        int m = 7;        k < m ? k++ : m = k;        printf("%d", k);    }
a) 7
b) 8
c) Compile time error
d) Run time error
c
2. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        int k = 8;        int m = 7;        k < m ? k = k + 1 : m = m + 1;        printf("%d", k);    }
a) Compile time error
b) 9
c) 8
d) Run time error
a
3. What will be the final values of a and c in the following C statement? (Initial values: a = 2, c = 1)
 c = (c) ? a = 0 : 2;
a) a = 0, c = 0;
b) a = 2, c = 2;
c) a = 2, c = 2;
d) a = 1, c = 2;
