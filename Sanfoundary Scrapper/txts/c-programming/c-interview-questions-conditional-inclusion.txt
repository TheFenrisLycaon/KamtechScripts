This section on C interview questions and answers focuses on “Conditional Inclusion”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C Interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Conditional Inclusion” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. For each #if, #ifdef, and #ifndef directive.
a) There are zero or more #elif directives
b) Zero or one #else directive
c) One matching #endif directive
d) All of the mentioned
d
2. The #else directive is used for _________
a) Conditionally include source text if the previous #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, or #elif test fails
b) Conditionally include source text if a macro name is not defined
c) Conditionally include source text if a macro name is defined
d) Ending conditional text
