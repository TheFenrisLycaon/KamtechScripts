This section on C interview questions and answers focuses on “Self-Referential Structures”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C Interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Self-Referential Structures” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    typedef struct p *q;    int main()    {        struct p        {            int x;            char y;            q ptr;        };        struct p p = {1, 2, &p};        printf("%d\n", p.ptr->x);        return 0;    }
