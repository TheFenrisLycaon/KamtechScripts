This section on C interview questions and answers focuses on “Unions”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C Interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Unions” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    union    {        int x;        char y;    }p;    int main()    {        p.x = 10;        printf("%d\n", sizeof(p));    }
a) Compile time error
b) sizeof(int) + sizeof(char)
c) Depends on the compiler
d) sizeof(int)
