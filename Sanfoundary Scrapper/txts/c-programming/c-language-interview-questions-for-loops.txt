This section on C language interview questions and answers focuses on “For Loops”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C language interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C language interview questions on “For Loops” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. The C code ‘for(;;)’ represents an infinite loop. It can be terminated by ___________
a) break
b) exit(0)
c) abort()
d) terminate
a
2. What will be the correct syntax for running two variable for loop simultaneously?
a)
   for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
   for (j = 0; j < n; j += 5)
b)
for (i = 0, j = 0; i < n, j < n; i++, j += 5)
c)
   for (i = 0; i < n;i++){}
   for (j = 0; j < n;j += 5){}
d) none of the mentioned
b
3. Which for loop has range of similar indexes of ‘i’ used in for (i = 0;i < n; i++)?
a) for (i = n; i>0; i–)
b) for (i = n; i >= 0; i–)
c) for (i = n-1; i>0; i–)
d) for (i = n-1; i>-1; i–)
d
4. Which of the following cannot be used as LHS of the expression in for (exp1;exp2; exp3)?
a) variable
b) function
c) typedef
d) macros
d
5. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        short i;        for (i = 1; i >= 0; i++)            printf("%d\n", i);     }
a) The control won’t fall into the for loop
b) Numbers will be displayed until the signed limit of short and throw a runtime error
c) Numbers will be displayed until the signed limit of short and program will successfully terminate
d) This program will get into an infinite loop and keep printing numbers with no errors
c
6. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        int k = 0;        for (k)            printf("Hello");    }
a) Compile time error
b) hello
c) Nothing
d) Varies
a
7. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        int k = 0;        for (k < 3; k++)        printf("Hello");    }
a) Compile time error
b) Hello is printed thrice
c) Nothing
d) Varies
a
8. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        double k = 0;        for (k = 0.0; k < 3.0; k++)            printf("Hello");    }
a) Run time error
b) Hello is printed thrice
c) Hello is printed twice
d) Hello is printed infinitely
b
