a
5. Comment on the following declaration.

    char *ptr[]; // ii)
a) Both i) and ii) and cannot exist due to same name
b) i) is legal, ii) is illegal
c) i) is illegal, ii) is legal
d) Both i) and ii) will work legal and flawlessly
d
6. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    struct student    {        int no;        char name[20];    }    void main()    {        struct student s;        s.no = 8;        printf("hello");    }
