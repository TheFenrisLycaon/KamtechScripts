1. Select the right statement.
a) synchronous signal occurs because of the action that your program takes
b) synchronous signal occurs because of action outside your program
c) asynchronous signal occurs because of the action that your program takes
d) division by zero is asynchronous
a
2. What does raise functions declared in signal.h do?
a) reports a synchronous signal
b) let’s you specify handling of signals
c) reports a asynchronous signal
d) doesn’t let you specify handling of signals
a
3. What is the type declared by the header file signal.h?
a) sig_atomic_t
b) sig_signal_t
c) sig_signal_h
d) sig_stomic_h
a
This is of int type and used as a variable in signal handling.
4. Which among the given header file is used to handle different signals reported during program execution?
a) stdarg.h
b) assert.h
c) signal.h
d) setjmp.h
c
5. Select the macro that abnormally terminates the program.
a) SIGILL
b) SIGTERM
c) SIGABRT
d) SIGFPE
c
6. Which of the following is the correct description of the macro SIGFPE?
a) erroneous arithmetic operation such as zero divide
b) invalid access to storage
c) termination request sent to the program
d) receipt of the interactive attention signal
a
7. _________ gives receipt of an interactive attention signals.
a) SIGILL
b) SIGTERM
c) SIGINT
d) SIGFPE
c
8. The sig argument specifies the signal, which may be any signal except _______ and _________
a) SIG_DFL, SIG_IGN
b) SIGKILL, SIGSTOP
c) SIG_KILL, SIG_STOP
d) SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN
b
9. void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int);If the value of func is SIG_IGN then _________
a) the signal will be ignored
b) default handling for that signal will occur
c) The signal() function will fail to execute
d) the signal will be ignored
a
10. In the c library function void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int), which statement is true with respect to func?
a) func is a pointer to the function
b) func is pointer to sig
c) func is a static variable
d) func is a pointer that points to all type of data
a
void (*signal(int sig, void (*func)(int)))(int). In this ‘func’ is a pointer to the function defined by the programmer or one of the following predefined functions:
SIG_DFL and SIG_IGN.
