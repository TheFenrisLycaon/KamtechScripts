1. What will be the output of the following C code?
char word[20 ] = "1.234555 WELCOME"; 
char *w; double dis; 
dis= strtod(word, &w); 
printf("The number is %lf\n", dis); 
printf("String  is |%s|", w);
a) The number is 1.234555 String  is |WELCOME|
b) The number is 1.2345550 String  is |WELCOME|
c) The number is 1.234555 String  is |1.234555 WELCOME|
d) Errror
a
2. Which statement is correct work reference to endptr?
double strtod(const char *nptr, char **endptr);
a) A pointer to the starting string is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is a null pointer
b) A pointer to the ﬁnal string is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is not a null pointer
c)  A pointer to the final string is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is a null pointer
d)  A pointer to the starting string is stored in the object pointed to by endptr, provided that endptr is not a null pointer
b
3.  Which of the following functions decomposes the input string into three pans: an initial, possibly empty, sequence of white-space characters?
a) strtod()
b) atof()
c) atol()
d) strtol()
d
4. The______function is used to convert the initial portion of the string pointed to by, to unsigned long int representation.
a) strtod()
b) atol()
c) strtoul()
d) strtol()
c
5. Which of the following is the correct syntax of the function strtoul()?
a) unsigned long int strtoul(const char *n, char **ptr, int base)
b) unsigned long int strtoul(const char *n, char **ptr)
c) unsigned long int strtoul(const char *n)
d) int strtoul(const char *n)
a
6. Select the right statement with reference to malloc() and calloc().
a) malloc() does not set the memory to zero whereas calloc() sets allocated memory to zero
b) malloc() sets the memory to zero whereas calloc() does not set allocated memory to zero
c) malloc() sets the memory to zero whereas calloc() sets allocated memory to zero
d) malloc() does not set the memory to zero whereas calloc() does not set allocated memory to zero
a
7. The calloc() function allocates space for an array of n objects, each of whose size is defined by size. Space is initialized to all bits zero.
a) true
b) false
a
This function is used to allocate the requested memory and returns a pointer to it.
8. Is this right explanation to the given code?
void *calloc(size_t n, size_t size) 
#n -- This is the number of elements to be allocated.
#size -- This is the size of elements.
a) true
b) false
a
9. Which among the given function does not return a value?
a) strtoul()
b) strtol()
c) rand()
d) srand()
d
The srand() function uses argument as a seed for a new sequence of pseudo-random numbers to be returned by subsequent calls to rand(). The srand() function returns no value.
10. Which function returns a pseudo-random integer?
a) srand()
b) rand()
c) malloc()
d) alloc()
b
The rand() function is used to compute a sequence of pseudo-random integers in the range 0 to RAND-MAX. The rand function returns a pseudo-random integer.
