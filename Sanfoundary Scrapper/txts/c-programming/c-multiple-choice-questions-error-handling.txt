This section on C MCQs (multiple choice questions) focuses on “Error Handling”. One shall practice these MCQs to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our multiple choice questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C multiple choice questions on “Error Handling” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What is the output of the following C code if there is no error in stream fp?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        FILE *fp;        fp = fopen("newfile", "w");        printf("%d\n", ferror(fp));        return 0;    }
a) Compilation error
