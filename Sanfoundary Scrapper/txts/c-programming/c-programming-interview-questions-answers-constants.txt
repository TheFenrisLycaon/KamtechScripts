b) 

   sanfoundry
   class
c) classundry
d) sanfoundry
c
Output:

classundry
3. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        printf("sanfoundry\r\nclass\n");        return 0;    }
a) sanfoundryclass
b) 

   sanfoundry
   class
c) classundry
d) sanfoundry
b
Output:
$ cc pgm9.c
$ a.out
sanfoundry
class
4. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        const int p;        p = 4;        printf("p is %d", p);        return 0;    }
a) p is 4
b) Compile time error
c) Run time error
d) p is followed by a garbage value
b
Output:
$ cc pgm10.c
pgm10.c: In function ‘main’:
pgm10.c:5: error: assignment of read-only variable ‘p’
5. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        int k = 4;        int *const p = &k;        int r = 3;        p = &r;        printf("%d", p);    }
a) Address of k
b) Address of r
c) Compile time error
d) Address of k + address of r
c
Output:
$ cc pgm11.c
pgm11.c: In function ‘main’:
pgm11.c:7: error: assignment of read-only variable ‘p’
pgm11.c:8: warning: format ‘%d’ expects type ‘int’, but argument 2 has type ‘int * const’
6. Which of the following statement is false?
a) Constant variables need not be defined as they are declared and can be defined later
b) Global constant variables are initialized to zero
c) const keyword is used to define constant values
d) You cannot reassign a value to a constant variable
a
7. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        int const k = 5;        k++;        printf("k is %d", k);    }
a) k is 6
b) Error due to const succeeding int
c) Error, because a constant variable can be changed only twice
d) Error, because a constant variable cannot be changed
d
Output:
$ cc pgm12.c
pgm12.c: In function ‘main’:
pgm12.c:5: error: increment of read-only variable ‘k’
8. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int const print()    {        printf("Sanfoundry.com");        return 0;    }    void main()    {        print();    }
a) Error because function name cannot be preceded by const
b) Sanfoundry.com
c) Sanfoundry.com is printed infinite times
d) Blank screen, no output
b
Output:
$ cc pgm13.c
$ a.out
Sanfoundry.com
