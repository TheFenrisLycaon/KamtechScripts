This section on C programming interview questions and answers focuses on “Bit-fields”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C programming interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C programming interview questions on “Bit-fields” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What is the correct syntax to initialize bit-fields in an structure?
a)
    struct temp
    {
        unsigned int a : 1;
    }s;
b)
    struct temp
    {
        unsigned int a = 1;
    }s;
c)
    struct temp
    {
        unsigned float a : 1;
    }s;
