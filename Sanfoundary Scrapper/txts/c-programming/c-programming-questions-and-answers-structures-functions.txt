This section on C programming questions and answers focuses on “Structures and Functions”. One shall practice these questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C programming questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C programming questions on “Structures and Functions” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    struct student    {        char *name;    };    struct student s;    struct student fun(void)    {        s.name = "newton";        printf("%s\n", s.name);        s.name = "alan";        return s;    }    void main()    {        struct student m = fun();        printf("%s\n", m.name);        m.name = "turing";        printf("%s\n", s.name);    }
