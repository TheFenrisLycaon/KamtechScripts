This section on online C test focuses on “Constants”. One shall practice these test questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walk-in interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our online C test questions come with the detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of online C test questions on “Constants” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        enum {ORANGE = 5, MANGO, BANANA = 4, PEACH};        printf("PEACH = %d\n", PEACH);    }
a) PEACH = 3
b) PEACH = 4
c) PEACH = 5
d) PEACH = 6
c
Output:
$ cc pgm1.c
$ a.out
PEACH = 5
2. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        printf("C programming %s", "Class by\n%s Sanfoundry", "WOW");    }
a) 

   C programming Class by
   WOW Sanfoundry
b) C programming Class by\n%s Sanfoundry
c) 

   C programming Class by
   %s Sanfoundry
d) Compilation error
c
The %s along with the Sanfoundry is not read as a format modifier while new line character prints the new line.
Output:
$ cc pgm2.c
$ a.out
C programming Class by
%s Sanfoundry
3. In the following code snippet, character pointer str holds a reference to the string ___________
char *str =  "Sanfoundry.com\0" "training classes";
a) Sanfoundry.com
b) Sanfoundry.com\0training classes
c) Sanfoundry.comtraining classes
d) Invalid declaration
b
4. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    #define a 10    int main()    {        const int a = 5;        printf("a = %d\n", a);    }
a) a = 5
b) a = 10
c) Compilation error
d) Runtime error
c
Output:
$ cc pgm3.c
pgm3.c: In function ‘main’:
pgm3.c:5: error: expected identifier or ‘(’ before numeric constant
5. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        int var = 010;        printf("%d", var);    }
a) 2
b) 8
c) 9
d) 10
b
Output:
$ cc pgm4.c
$ a.out
8
6. What will be the output of the following C function?
    #include <stdio.h>    enum birds {SPARROW, PEACOCK, PARROT};    enum animals {TIGER = 8, LION, RABBIT, ZEBRA};    int main()    {        enum birds m = TIGER;        int k;        k = m;        printf("%d\n", k);        return 0;    }
a) 0
b) Compile time error
c) 1
d) 8
d
Output:
$ cc pgm5.c
$ a.out
8
7. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    #define MAX 2    enum bird {SPARROW = MAX + 1, PARROT = SPARROW + MAX};    int main()    {        enum bird b = PARROT;        printf("%d\n", b);        return 0;    }
a) Compilation error
b) 5
c) Undefined value
d) 2
b
Output:
$ cc pgm6.c
$ a.out
5
8. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    #include <string.h>    int main()    {        char *str = "x";        char c = 'x';        char ary[1];        ary[0] = c;        printf("%d %d", strlen(str), strlen(ary));        return 0;    }
a) 1 1
b) 2 1
c) 2 2
d) 1 (undefined value)
d
Output:
$ cc pgm7.c
$ a.out
1 5
