Sanfoundry’s 1000+ MCQs on C helps anyone preparing for placement in Wipro and other companies. Anyone looking for Wipro placement papers should practice these 1000+ questions continuously for 2-3 months, thereby ensuring a top position in placements.
Here is a listing of C language programming interview questions on “Data Types and Sizes” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        float f1 = 0.1;        if (f1 == 0.1)            printf("equal\n");        else            printf("not equal\n");    }
a) equal
b) not equal
c) output depends on the compiler
d) error
b
Output:
$ cc pgm4.c
$ a.out
not equal
2. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        float f1 = 0.1;        if (f1 == 0.1f)            printf("equal\n");        else            printf("not equal\n");    }
a) equal
b) not equal
c) output depends on compiler
d) error
a
Output:
$ cc pgm5.c
$ a.out
equal
3. What will be the output of the following C code on a 32-bit machine?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        int x = 10000;        double y = 56;        int *p = &x;        double *q = &y;        printf("p and q are %d and %d", sizeof(p), sizeof(q));        return 0;    }
a) p and q are 4 and 4
b) p and q are 4 and 8
c) compiler error
d) p and q are 2 and 8
a
Output:
$ cc pgm6.c
$ a.out
p and q are 4 and 4

a) char > int > float
b) int > char > float
c) char < int < double
d) double > char > int
c
5. What will be the output of the following C code on a 64 bit machine?
    #include <stdio.h>    union Sti    {        int nu;        char m;    };    int main()    {        union Sti s;        printf("%d", sizeof(s));        return 0;    }
a) 8
b) 5
c) 9
d) 4
d
Output:
$ cc pgm7.c
$ a.out
4
6. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        float x = 'a';        printf("%f", x);        return 0;    }
a) a
b) run time error
c) a.0000000
d) 97.000000
d
Output:
$ cc pgm8.c
$ a.out
97.000000
