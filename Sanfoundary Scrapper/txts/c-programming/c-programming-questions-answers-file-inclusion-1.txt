This section on C programming quiz focuses on “File Inclusion”. One shall practice these quizzes to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C quiz comes with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C programming quiz on “File Inclusion” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What is the sequence for preprocessor to look for the file within <>?
a) The predefined location then the current directory
b) The current directory then the predefined location
c) The predefined location only
d) The current directory location
a
2. Which directory the compiler first looks for the file when using #include?
a) Current directory where program is saved
b) C:COMPILERINCLUDE
c) S:SOURCEHEADERS
d) Both C:COMPILERINCLUDE and S:SOURCEHEADERS simultaneously
b
3. What would happen if you create a file stdio.h and use #include “stdio.h”?
a) The predefined library file will be selected
b) The user-defined library file will be selected

b
4. How is search done in #include and #include “somelibrary.h” according to C standard?
a) When former is used, current directory is searched and when latter is used, standard directory is searched
b) When former is used, standard directory is searched and when latter is used, current directory is searched
c) When former is used, search is done in implementation defined manner and when latter is used, current directory is searched
d) For both, search for ‘somelibrary’ is done in implementation-defined places
d
5. How is search done in #include and #include”somelibrary.h” normally or conventionally?
a) When former is used, current directory is searched and when latter is used, standard directory is searched
b) When former is used, predefined directory is searched and when latter is used, current directory is searched and then predefined directories are searched
c) When former is used, search is done in implementation defined manner and latter is used to search current directory
d) For both, search for somelibrary is done in implementation-defined manner
b
