Sanfoundry’s 1000+ MCQs on C helps anyone preparing for placement in Citrix and other companies. Anyone looking for Citrix placement papers should practice these 1000+ questions continuously for 2-3 months, thereby ensuring a top position in placements.
Here is a listing of C programming questions on “Pointer to Structures” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
