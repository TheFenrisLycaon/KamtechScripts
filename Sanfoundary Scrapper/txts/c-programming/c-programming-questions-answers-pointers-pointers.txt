Sanfoundry’s 1000+ Interview Questions & Answers on C helps anyone preparing for Mindtree and other companies C interviews. One should practice these 1000+ interview questions and answers continuously for 2-3 months to clear Mindtree interviews on C Programming language. 
Here is a listing of C programming questions on “Pointers to Pointers” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What substitution should be made to //-Ref such that ptr1 points to variable c in the following C code?

a) *sptr = &c;
b) **sptr = &c;
c) *ptr1 = &c;
d) none of the mentioned
a
2. Which of the following declaration will result in run-time error?

b) int **c = &*c;
c) int **c = **c;
d) none of the mentioned
d
3. Comment on the output of the following C code.
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        int a = 10;        int **c -= &&a;    }
