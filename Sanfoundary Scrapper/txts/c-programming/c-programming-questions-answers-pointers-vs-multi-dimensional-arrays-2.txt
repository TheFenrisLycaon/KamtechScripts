Sanfoundry’s 1000+ Interview Questions & Answers on C helps anyone preparing for Intel and other companies C interviews. One should practice these 1000+ interview questions and answers continuously for 2-3 months to clear Intel interviews on C Programming language. 
Here is a listing of C programming questions on “Pointers Vs. Multi-dimensional Arrays” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code (considering sizeof char is 1 and pointer is 4)?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        char *a[2] = {"hello", "hi"};        printf("%d", sizeof(a));        return 0;    }
a) 9
b) 4
c) 8
d) 10
c
2. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        char a[2][6] = {"hello", "hi"};        printf("%d", sizeof(a));        return 0;    }
a) 9
b) 12
c) 8
d) 10
b
3. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        char a[2][6] = {"hello", "hi"};        printf("%s", *a + 1);        return 0;    }
a) hello
b) hi
c) ello
d) ello hi
c
4. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        char *a[2] = {"hello", "hi"};        printf("%s", *(a + 1));        return 0;    }
a) hello
b) ello
c) hi
d) ello hi
c
5. What is the advantage of a multidimensional array over pointer array?
a) Predefined size
b) Input can be taken from user
c) Faster Access
d) All of the mentioned
d
6. Which of the following operation is possible using a pointer char? (Assuming the declaration is char *a;)
a) Input via %s
b) Generation of the multidimensional array
c) Changing address to point at another location
d) All of the mentioned
c
7. Comment on the following two operations.
    int *a[] = {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3, 4}}; //- 1
    int b[4][4] = {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3, 4}};//- 2
a) 1 will work, 2 will not
b) 1 and 2, both will work
c) 1 won’t work, 2 will work
d) Neither of them will work
c
8. Comment on the following two operations.
    int *a[] = {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3, 4}}; //- 1
    int b[][] = {{1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 3, 4}}; //- 2
a) 1 works, 2 doesn’t
b) 2 works, 1 doesn’t
c) Both of them work
d) Neither of them work
d
