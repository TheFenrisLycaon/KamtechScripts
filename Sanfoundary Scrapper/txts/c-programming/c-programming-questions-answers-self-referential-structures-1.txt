Sanfoundry’s 1000+ Interview Questions & Answers on C helps anyone preparing for AMD and other companies C interviews. One should practice these 1000+ interview questions and answers continuously for 2-3 months to clear AMD interviews on C Programming language. 
Here is a listing of C question bank on “Self Referential Structures” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
