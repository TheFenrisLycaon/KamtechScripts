This section on C programming questions and answers focuses on “Sizeof”. One shall practice these questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C programming questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
