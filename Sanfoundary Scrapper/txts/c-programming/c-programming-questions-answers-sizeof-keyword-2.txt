This section on C interview questions and answers focuses on “Sizeof operator”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C Interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Sizeof operator” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. Which among the following is never possible in C when members are different in a structure and union?

   //Let P be a structure
   //Let Q be a union
a) sizeof(P) is greater than sizeof(Q)
b) sizeof(P) is less than sizeof(Q)
c) sizeof(P) is equal to sizeof(Q)
d) none of the mentioned
d
2. Which among the following is never possible in C when members in a structure are the same as that in a union?

   //Let P be a structure
   //Let Q be a union
a) sizeof(P) is greater than sizeof(Q)
b) sizeof(P) is equal to sizeof(Q)
c) sizeof(P) is less than to sizeof(Q)
d) none of the mentioned
c
3. What will be the size of the following C structure?
    #include <stdio.h>    struct temp    {        int a[10];        char p;    };
a) 5
b) 11
c) 41
d) 44
d
4. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    main()    {        int a = 1;        printf("size of a is %d, ", sizeof(++a));        printf("value of a is %d", a);    };
a) size of a is 4, value of a is 1
b) size of a is 4, value of a is 2
c) size of a is 2, value of a is 2
d) size of a is 2, value of a is 2
a
5. Which among the following statement is right?
a) sizeof(struct stemp*) > sizeof(union utemp*) > sizeof(char *)
b) sizeof(struct stemp*) < sizeof(union utemp*) < sizeof(char *)
c) sizeof(struct stemp*) = sizeof(union utemp*) = sizeof(char *)
d) the order Depends on the compiler
c
6. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    printf("%d", sizeof(strlen("HELLOWORLD")));
a) Output, 4
b) Output, 10
c) Output, 16
d) Error, sizeof cannot evaluate size of a function
a
7. Which of the following cannot be used inside sizeof?
a) pointers
b) functions
c) macro definition
d) none of the mentioned
d
8. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    (sizeof double = 8, float = 4, void = 1)    #define PI 3.14    int main()    {        printf("%d", sizeof(PI));    }
a) Output is 8
b) Output is 4
c) Output is 1
d) Error, we can’t use sizeof on macro-definitions
a
