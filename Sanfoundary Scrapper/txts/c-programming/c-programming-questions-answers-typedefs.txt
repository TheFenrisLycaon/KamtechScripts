This section on C programming questions and answers focuses on “Typedefs”. One shall practice these questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C programming questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C programming questions on “Typedefs” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    typedef struct student    {        char *a;    }stu;    void main()    {        struct stu s;        s.a = "hi";        printf("%s", s.a);    }
a) Compile time error

a) Compile time error
b) Nothing
c) Undefined behaviour
d) Depends on the standard
a
