This section on C programming questions and answers focuses on “Variable Length Argument”. One shall practice these questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C programming questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C programming questions on “Variable Length Argument” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    #include <stdarg.h>    void func(int, ...);    int main()    {        func(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13);        return 0;    }    void func(int n, ...)    {        int number, i = 0;        va_list start;        va_start(start, n);        while (i != 3)        {            number = va_arg(start, int);            i++;        }        printf("%d", number);    }
