Sanfoundry’s 1000+ MCQs on C helps anyone preparing for placement in Cisco and other companies. Anyone looking for Cisco placement papers should practice these 1000+ questions continuously for 2-3 months, thereby ensuring a top position in placements.
Here is a listing of C programming questions on “Static Variables” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code if these two files namely test.c and test1.c are linked and run?
      -------file test.c-------    #include <stdio.h>    #include ""test.h""    int main()    {        i = 10;        printf(""%d "", i);        foo();    }     -----file test1.c------    #include <stdio.h>    #include ""test.h""    int foo()    {        printf(""%d\n"", i);    }     -----file test.h-----    #include <stdio.h>    #include <stdlib.h>    static int i;

4. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        foo();        foo();    }    void foo()    {        int i = 11;        printf("%d ", i);        static int j = 12;        j = j + 1;        printf("%d\n", j);    }
a) 11 12 11 12
b) 11 13 11 14

8. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void func();    int main()    {        static int b = 20;        func();    }    void func()    {        static int b;        printf("%d", b);    }
a) Output will be 0
b) Output will be 20
c) Output will be a garbage value
d) Compile time error due to redeclaration of static variable
a
