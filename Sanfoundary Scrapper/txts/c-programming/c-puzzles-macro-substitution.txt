This section on C questions and puzzles focuses on “Macro Substitution”. One shall practice these questions and puzzles to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These programming puzzles can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C questions and puzzles on “Macro Substitution” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:

a) k l
b) kl
c) Compile time error
d) Undefined behaviour

a) k l
b) kl
c) Compile time error
d) m ## n

c
5. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void f();    int main()    {        #define foo(x, y) x / y + x        f();    }    void f()    {        printf("%d\n", foo(-3, 3));    }
a) -8
b) -4

b
6. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void f();    int main()    {        #define max 10        f();        return 0;    }    void f()    {        printf("%d\n", max * 10);    }
a) 100
b) Compile time error since #define cannot be inside functions
c) Compile time error since max is not visible in f()
d) Undefined behaviour
a
