1. Which of the following keywords is used to define an alternate name for an already existing data type?
a) default
b) volatile
c) typedef
d) static
c
2. We want to create an alias name for an identifier of the type unsigned long. The alias name is: ul. The correct way to do this using the keyword typedef is ____________
a) typedef unsigned long ul;
b) unsigned long typedef ul;
c) typedef ul unsigned long;
d) ul typedef unsigned long;
a
Hence if we want to create an alias name (ul) for an identifier of type unsigned long, the correct way to do this would be: typedef unsigned long ul;
3. What will be the output of the following C code?
#include<stdio.h>
main()

    printf("%d",d);
}
a) 10
b) 16
c) 8
d) error
a

typedef struct employee
{
    char  name[50];
    int   salary;
} e1;
void main( )
{
    printf("Enter Employee name");
    scanf("%s",e1.name);
    printf("\n%s",e1.name);
}
a) Sanfoundry.name
b) nSanfoundry
c) Sanfoundry
d) Error
d
5. The keyword typedef cannot be used to give alias names to pointers.
a) True
b) False
b

typedef char x[10];
x myArray[5];
a) 5 bytes
b) 10 bytes
c) 40 bytes
d) 50 bytes
d
7. We want to declare x, y and z as pointers of type int. The alias name given is: intpt                                           The correct way to do this using the keyword typedef is:
a) 

    int typedef* intptr;
    int x,y,z;
b) 

     typedef* intptr;
     int x,y,z;
c) 

    int typedef* intptr;
    intptr x,y,z;
d) 

     typedef int* intptr;
     intptr x,y,z;
d
  
8. Consider this statement: typedef enum good {a, b, c} hello;                                                                                 Which of the following statements is incorrect about hello?
a) hello is a typedef of enum good
b) hello is a structure
c) hello is a variable of type enum good
d) the statement shown above is erroneous
a

d) compiler, user
c
10. What will be the output of the following C code?
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    typedef union a
    {
        int i;
        char ch[2];
    }hello;
    hello u;
    u.ch[0] = 3;
    u.ch[1] = 2;
    printf("%d, %d", u.ch[0], u.ch[1]);
    return 0;
}
a) 2, 3
b) 3, 2
c) 32
d) error
b
