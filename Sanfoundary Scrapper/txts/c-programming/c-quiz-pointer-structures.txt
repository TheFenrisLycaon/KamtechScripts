This section on C quiz focuses on “Pointer to Structures”. One shall practice these quizzes to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C quiz comes with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C quiz on “Pointer to Structures” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:

a) func(&s.a);
b) func(&(s).a);
c) func(&(s.a));
d) none of the mentioned
d
7. Which of the following structure declaration doesn’t require pass-by-reference?

   main(){}
b)
   struct temp{int a;};
   main(){
       struct temp s;
   }
c)
   struct temp{int a;};
   main(){}
   struct temp s;
d) none of the mentioned
d
8. Which option is not possible for the following function call?
func(&s.a); //where s is a variable of type struct and a is the member of the struct.
a) Compiler can access entire structure from the function
b) Individual member’s address can be displayed in structure
c) Individual member can be passed by reference in a function

a
9. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    struct temp    {        int a;    } s;    void change(struct temp);    main()    {        s.a = 10;        change(s);        printf("%d\n", s.a);    }    void change(struct temp s)    {        s.a = 1;    }
