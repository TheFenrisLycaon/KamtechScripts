This section on C quiz focuses on “Pointer to Functions”. One shall practice these quizzes to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C quiz comes with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C quiz on “Pointer to Functions” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
