This section on C interview questions and answers focuses on “Declarations”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walk-in interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C Interview questions come with the detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Declarations” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void foo(const int *);    int main()    {        const int i = 10;        printf("%d ", i);        foo(&i);        printf("%d", i);     }    void foo(const int *i)    {        *i = 20;    }
a) Compile time error
b) 10 20
c) Undefined value
d) 10
a
Output:
$ cc pgm1.c
pgm1.c: In function ‘foo’:
pgm1.c:13: error: assignment of read-only location ‘*i’
2. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        const int i = 10;        int *ptr = &i;        *ptr = 20;        printf("%d\n", i);        return 0;    }
a) Compile time error
b) Compile time warning and printf displays 20
c) Undefined behaviour
d) 10
b
Output:
$ cc pgm2.c
pgm2.c: In function ‘main’:
pgm2.c:5: warning: initialization discards qualifiers from pointer target type
$ a.out
20

3. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        j = 10;        printf("%d\n", j++);        return 0;    }
a) 10
b) 11
c) Compile time error
d) 0
c
Output:
$ cc pgm3.c
pgm3.c: In function ‘main’:
pgm3.c:4: error: ‘j’ undeclared (first use in this function)
pgm3.c:4: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
pgm3.c:4: error: for each function it appears in.)
4. Will the following C code compile without any error?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++);            return 0;    }
a) Yes
b) No
c) Depends on the C standard implemented by compilers
d) Error
c
Output:
$ cc pgm4.c
pgm4.c: In function ‘main’:
pgm4.c:4: error: ‘for’ loop initial declarations are only allowed in C99 mode
pgm4.c:4: note: use option -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 to compile your code
5. Will the following C code compile without any error?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        int k;        {            int k;            for (k = 0; k < 10; k++);        }    }
a) Yes
b) No
c) Depends on the compiler
d) Depends on the C standard implemented by compilers
a
Output:
$ cc pgm5.c
6. Which of the following declaration is not supported by C?
a) String str;
b) char *str;
c) float str = 3e2;
d) Both String str; & float str = 3e2;
a
7. Which of the following format identifier can never be used for the variable var?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        char *var = "Advanced Training in C by Sanfoundry.com";    }
a) %f
b) %d
c) %c
d) %s
a
%d can still be used to display its ASCII value.
%s is recommended.
%f cannot be used for the variable var.
