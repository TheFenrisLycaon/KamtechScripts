This section on C interview questions and answers focuses on “Arrays of Structures”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C Interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Arrays of Structures” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. The correct syntax to access the member of the ith structure in the array of structures is?
Assuming: struct temp
    {
        int b;
    }s[50];
a) s.b.[i];
b) s.[i].b;
c) s.b[i];
d) s[i].b;
d
2. Comment on the output of the following C code.
    #include <stdio.h>    struct temp    {        int a;        int b;        int c;    };    main()    {        struct temp p[] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};    }
a) No Compile time error, generates an array of structure of size 3
b) No Compile time error, generates an array of structure of size 9
c) Compile time error, illegal declaration of a multidimensional array
d) Compile time error, illegal assignment to members of structure
a
