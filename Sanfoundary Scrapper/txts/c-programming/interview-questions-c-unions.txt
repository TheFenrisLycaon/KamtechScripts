This section on C interview questions and answers focuses on “Unions”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C Interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Unions” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. The size of a union is determined by the size of the __________
a) First member in the union
b) Last member in the union
c) Biggest member in the union
d) Sum of the sizes of all members
c
2. Which member of the union will be active after REF LINE in the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    union temp    {        int a;        float b;        char c;    };    union temp s = {1,2.5,’A’}; //REF LINE
a) a
b) b
c) c
d) Such declaration are illegal
a
3. What would be the size of the following union declaration?  (Assuming size of double = 8, size of int = 4, size of char = 1)
