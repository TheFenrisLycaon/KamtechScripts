This section on C programming questions and answers focuses on “Pointers Vs. Multi-dimensional Arrays”. One shall practice these questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C programming questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C programming questions on “Pointers Vs. Multi-dimensional Arrays” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. Which is true for a, if a is defined as “int a[10][20];”?
a) a is true two-dimensional array
b) 200 int-sized locations have been set aside
c) The conventional rectangular subscript calculation 20 * row  + col is used to find the element a[row, col].
d) All of the mentioned
d
2. Which is true for b, if b is defined as “int *b[10];”?
a) The definition only allocates 10 pointers and does not initialize them
b) Initialization must be done explicitly
c) The definition only allocates 10 pointers and does not initialize them & Initialization must be done explicitly
d) Error
c
3. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        char a[10][5] = {"hi", "hello", "fellows"};        printf("%s", a[2]);    }
a) fellows
b) fellow
c) fello
d) fell
c
4. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        char a[10][5] = {"hi", "hello", "fellows"};        printf("%p\n", a);        printf("%p", a[0]);    }
a) same address is printed
b) different address is printed
c) hello
d) hi hello fello
a
5. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    void main()    {        char a[10][5] = {"hi", "hello", "fellows"};        printf("%d", sizeof(a[1]));    }
a) 2
b) 4
c) 5
d) 10
c
6. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        char a[1][5] = {"hello"};        printf("%s", a[0]);        return 0;    }
a) Compile time error
b) hello
c) Undefined behaviour
d) hellon
c
7. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        char *a[1] = {"hello"};        printf("%s", a[0]);        return 0;    }
a) Compile time error
b) hello
c) Undefined behaviour
d) hellon
b
8. Which of the following statements are true?
    P. Pointer to Array
    Q. Multi-dimensional array
a) P are static, Q are static
b) P are static, Q are dynamic
c) P are dynamic, Q are static
d) P are dynamic, Q are dynamic
c
