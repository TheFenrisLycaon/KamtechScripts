Sanfoundry’s 1000+ Interview Questions & Answers on C helps anyone preparing for Ericsson and other companies C interviews. One should practice these 1000+ interview questions and answers continuously for 2-3 months to clear Ericsson interviews on C Programming language. 
Here is a listing of tough C interview questions on “Initialization of Pointer Arrays” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What will be the output of the following C code?
    #include <stdio.h>    int main()    {        char *p[1] = {"hello"};        printf("%s", (p)[0]);        return 0;    }
a) Compile time error
b) Undefined behaviour
c) hello
d) None of the mentioned
