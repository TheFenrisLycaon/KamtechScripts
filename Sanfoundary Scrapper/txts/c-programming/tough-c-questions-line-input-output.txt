This section on tough C questions focuses on “Line Input & Output”. One shall practice these questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C programming questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of tough C questions on “Line Input & Output” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What is the size of array “line” used in fgets(line, maxline, *fp) function?

c) maxline + 1
d) Size is dynamic
b
2. What will be the output of the following C function when EOF returns?
   int fputs(char *line, FILE *fp)
a) ‘�’ character of array line is encountered
b) ‘n’ character in array line is encountered

d) When an error occurs
d
3. Identify X library function for line input and output in the following C code?
