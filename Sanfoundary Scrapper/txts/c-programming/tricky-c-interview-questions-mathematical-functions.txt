This section on tricky C interview questions focuses on “Mathematical Functions”. One shall practice these tricky questions to improve their C programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C Programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C concepts.
Here is a listing of C interview questions on “Mathematical Functions” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:

a) fmod();
b) div();
c) atan2();
d) all of the mentioned
d
2. Which mathematical function among the following does NOT require int parameters?
