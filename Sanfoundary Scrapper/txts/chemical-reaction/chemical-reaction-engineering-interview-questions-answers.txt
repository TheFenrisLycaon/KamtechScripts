1. For a homogeneous reaction of order n, the unit of rate constant, k is ____
a) concn-1
b) \(\frac{conc^{-1}}{time} \) 
c) \(\frac{conc^{-1}}{time^{1-n}} \) 
d) \(\frac{conc^{1-n}}{time^{-1}} \) 
d
\(\frac{mol}{m^3×s} = k.(\frac{mol}{m^3})^n \) 
Hence the unit of k is \(\frac{conc^{1-n}}{time^{-1}}. \) 
2. The unit of rate constant, k for a first order reaction is ____
a) (time)-1
b) mol. time
c) \(\frac{mol}{m^3} \) 
d) \(\frac{mol}{m^3×s} \) 
a
Unit of rate = \(\frac{mol}{m^3×s}  \) 
Concentration, CA is in \(\frac{mol}{m^3} \)  
Hence, unit of k is \(\frac{\frac{mol}{m^3×s}}{\frac{mol}{m^3}}\) = (sec)-1.
3. Which among the following reactions is elementary?
a) A + B → R; (-rA) = k CACB
b) 2A + B → R; (-rA) = k CA2
c) 2A + B → R; (-rA) = k CACB2
d) A + B → R; (-rA) = k CB
a
(-rA) = k CA1CB1.
4. An example of pseudo first order reaction is ____
a) Hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid using water
b) NO2 + CO → NO + CO2
c) N2O5 → NO2 + 1/2 O2
d) 2NO + H2 → N2O + H2O
a
5. The study of rates at which chemical reactions occur and the effect of various parameters on the rate are termed as ____
a) Chemical Technology
b) Chemical Sciences
c) Chemical Kinetics
d) Fluid Mechanics
c
6. The rate of reaction is rapid for which of the following reactions?

c) \(\frac{-r_A}{1}\)=\(\frac{-r_B}{1}\)=\(\frac{r_R}{1}\) 
d) \(\frac{-r_A}{3}\)=\(\frac{-r_B}{4}\)=\(\frac{r_C}{1}\) 
c
8. Which among the following reactions is elementary?
a) Ester formation from ethanol and acetic acid
b) Formation of Hydrogen Bromide
c) Decomposition of acetaldehyde to give methane and carbon monoxide
d) Formation of Hydrogen Iodide
a
9. The molecularity of the reaction A+2B → R, (-rA) = k CACB2 is ____
a) 2
b) 1
c) 3
d) 0
c
10. Order of the reaction (-rA) = kCAa.CBb is ____
a) a
