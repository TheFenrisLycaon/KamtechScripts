1. If tp is the time spent in the PFR and tm is the time spent in the CSTR, then which is the plot of RTD for a PFR followed by CSTR?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
2. State true or false.
A corner peak in the E(t) indicates bypassing of reactants.
a) True
b) False
a
3. If the residence time obtained for a reactor by the RTD experiments is less than that expected, it indicates the presence of ____
a) CSTR
b) PFR
c) Bubbling bed reactor
d) Dead volume
d
4. If the entire volume of a PFR is 10 m3 and dead volume is 2 m3, then the active volume of the reactor is ____
a) 20
b) 5
c) 8
d) 12
c
Vp is the active volume of PFR and Vd is the dead volume.
10 = Vp + 2
Vp = 2.
5. Which of the following represents the exit age distribution of PFR with recycle?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
6. State true or false.
The exit age distribution for the series combination of a PFR followed by a CSTR is same as that for CSTR followed by a PFR.
a) True
b) False
a
7. For two PFRs P1 and P2 in parallel, the exit age distribution gives ____
a) A single peak at t = tp1
b) A single peak at t = tp2
c) Two peaks, one at t = tp1 and the other at t = tp2
d) A corner peak
c
v1 and v2 are the volumetric flowrates in P1 and P2, respectively.
8. The variance of a PFR is ____
a) 1
b) 0
c) ∞
d) -1
b
9. The variance of a CSTR is ____
a) 1
b) 0
c) ∞
d) -1
c
10. The exit age distribution for the parallel arrangement of a PFR followed by a CSTR is ____
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
