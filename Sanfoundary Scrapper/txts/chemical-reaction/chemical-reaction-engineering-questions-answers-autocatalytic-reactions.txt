1. Autocatalytic reactions are the ones in which ____
a) One of the products poisons the catalyst
b) There is no catalyst employed
c) Only one reactant is involved
d) One of the products catalyses the reaction
d
2. State true or false.
An autocatalytic reaction is represented as A + R → R + R where, A is a reactant and R formed as the product catalyses the reaction.
a) True
b) False
a
3. State true or false.
Autocatalytic reactions are single order reactions.
a) True
b) False
b
4. An example of autocatalytic reaction is ____
a) Ammonia formation reaction
b) Hydrogen peroxide decomposition reaction
c) Reaction of permanganate with oxalic acid
d) Oxidation of copper
c
5. Which of the following correctly represents autocatalytic reactions?
a)
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
6. If the area under the curve of \(\frac{1}{-r_A} \) versus XA for a PFR used to carry out an autocatalytic reaction is 5\((\frac{m^3 s}{mol}),\) then the ratio of change in volume to molar feed rate is ____
a) 5
b) 10
c) 15
d) 20
b
FA0dXA=(-rA)dV
The area under the curve of \(\frac{1}{-r_A} \)versus XA = \(\frac{dXA}{(-rA)} = \frac{dV}{F_{A0}}\) = 5.
7. Which of the following reactors is used for carrying out autocatalytic reactions?
a) CSTR
b) PFR
c) Batch reactor
d) A combination of CSTR and PFR.
d
8. The combination of reactors to achieve the required conversion for the autocatalytic reaction depicted below is _______
a) PFR followed by batch reactor
b) CSTR followed by PFR
c) PFR followed by CSTR
d) Batch reactor followed by CSTR
b
To achieve the required conversion, CSTR followed by a PFR is used. This combination of reactors reduces the reactor volume compared to the other combination of reactors to achieve the same conversion.
9. The autocatalyst in microbial fermentation reactions is:
a) Organic feed
b) Microbes
c) Enzyme
d) Product chemical
b
10. The graph shows the plot of \(\frac{1}{-r_A}\) versus conversion for an autocatalytic reactor. If a single reactor is to be employed to achieve a conversion of 0.5, then which of the following reactors will best suit the given condition?
a) PFR
b) Batch reactor
c) CSTR
d) Fluidised bed reactor
c
The blackened region gives the CSTR volume.
