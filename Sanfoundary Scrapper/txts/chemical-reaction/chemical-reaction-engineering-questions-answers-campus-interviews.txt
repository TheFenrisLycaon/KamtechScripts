1. For the parallel reaction A → B and A → C, of rate constants k1 and k2 respectively, both reactions of order 1, the rate expression is given as ____
a) (-rA) = k1CA + k2CA
b) (-rA) = k1CA – k2CA
c) (-rA) = k2CA
d) (-rA) = k1CA
a
A forms two products: B and C. The concentration of A decreases as the reaction progresses.
2. The rate determining step of a series of reactions is the one ____
a) That is fastest
b) That is slowest
c) That does not contribute to the reaction
d) That does not occur
b
3. An assumption of Steady State Approximation is ____
a) Reaction occurs without the formation of intermediates
b) Catalyst does not accelerate reaction rate
c) One of the intermediates in the reaction is consumed as quickly as it is generated
d) Equilibrium state is attained at the end of a reaction
c
4. The reaction involving oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide follows the mechanism ____
a) \(\frac{-dO_2}{dt}\) = k[NO2]2[O2] 
b) \(\frac{-dO_2}{dt}\) = k[NO2][O2] 
c) \(\frac{-dO_2}{dt}\) = k[NO2]2[O2]2
d) \(\frac{-dO_2}{dt}\) = k[NO2][O2]2
a
5. The order of the reaction involving the conversion of ozone to oxygen is ____
a) Zero order
b) First order
c) Second order
d) Third order
b
-rO3= k[O3]2[O2]-1
Order = 2-1 = 1
6. At very low concentrations of azomethane, its decomposition follows which order?
a) First order
b) Zero order
c) Third order
d) Second order
d
rN2 = \(\frac{k_1 k_3 C_{Azo}^2}{k_3+k_2 C_{Azo}} \) 
Where, k1, k2 and k3 are rate constants of the 3 intermediate reactions involved in azomethane formation.
At low concentration, k2 CAzo << k3
Hence, rN2=k1CAzo2.
7. State true or false.
Gas phase decomposition of N2O follows first order mechanism for low concentrations of N2O and second order mechanism for high concentrations of N2O.
a) True
b) False
a
At low concentrations of N2O, kNO2 << 1 and the reactions follows second order. At high concentrations of N2O, kNO2 >> 1 and the reaction follows first order.
8. State true or false.
Decomposition of nitrogen pentoxide follows second order mechanism, assuming that the kinetics is controlled by a single step mechanism.
a) True
b) False
b
Hence, the reaction follows first order.
9. Formation of hydrogen iodide from the corresponding elements is a ____
a) Single step mechanism
b) Two step mechanism
c) Three step mechanism
d) Four step mechanism
b
10. In the formation of phosgene from carbon monoxide and chlorine, which of the following is rate determining?
a) Decomposition of chlorine
b) Formation of COCl.
c) Reaction of COCl. with Cl2
d) Decomposition of CO2
c
