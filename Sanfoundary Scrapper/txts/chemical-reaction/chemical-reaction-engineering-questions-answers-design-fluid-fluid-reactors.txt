1. State true or false.
In physical absorption of a gas in a liquid, the resistance to transfer of gas to liquid is only in the liquid phase.
a) True
b) False
b
2. Which of the following is not a fluid – fluid reaction?
a) Reaction of chlorine with benzene to produce chlorobenzene
b) Soap formation by action of aqueous alkali on fatty acids
c) Action of ammonia on aqueous nitric acid
d) Combustion of coal
d
3. Which of the following is the correct expression of Henry’s law?
a) CA = \(\frac{p_A}{H_A} \) 
b) HA = \(\frac{C_A}{p_A} \) 
c) pA = \(\frac{C_A}{H_A} \) 
d) CA = \(\frac{H_A}{p_A} \) 
a
4. What is the rate expression for physical absorption of a gas A to a liquid based on two film theory? (Where, kAg is the gas film mass transfer coefficient and kAl is the liquid film mass transfer coefficient)
a) -rA = \(\frac{p_A- H_A C_A}{\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{k_{Al}a}} \) 
b) -rA = \(\frac{p_A- C_A}{\frac{1}{k_{Ag} a} + \frac{1}{k_{Al} a}} \) 
c) -rA = \(\frac{p_A- H_A C_A}{\frac{1}{k_{Al}a}+  \frac{1}{k_{Al}a}} \) 
d) -rA = \(\frac{H_A C_A}{\frac{1}{k_{Al} a}+  \frac{1}{k_{Al}a}} \) 
c
\(\frac{-r_A}{k_{Al} a}\) = CA – CAi. Substituting CA = \(\frac{p_A}{H_A}\), we obtain -rA = \(\frac{p_A- H_A C_A}{\frac{1}{k_{Al}a}+  \frac{1}{k_{Al}a}}. \)
