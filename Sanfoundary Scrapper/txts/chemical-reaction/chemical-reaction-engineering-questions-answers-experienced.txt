1. Which of the following is not a characteristic of tracer?
a) Inertness
b) Non – reactive
c) Easily detectable
d) Adsorbance onto the reactor surface
d
2. If the exit age distribution is given as δ(t – 4), then \(\int_0^∞\) t2 E(t)dt is ____
a) 16
b) 4
c) 8
d) 20
a
3. If C=2 and area under the C – curve is 4 for a pulse input, then the value of E is ____
a) 2
b) 0.5
c) 1
d) 8
b
\(\int_0^∞\) C dt is the area under the C – curve. Hence, E = \(\frac{2}{4}\) = 0.5.
4. The F(t) function for a PFR is _____
a) F(t) = \(\begin{cases}
0 & for & 0 < t < \overline{t}, \\
∞ & for & t > \overline{t}\\
\end{cases} \) 
b) F(t) = \(\begin{cases}
1 & for & 0 < t < \overline{t}, \\
0 & for & t > \overline{t}\\
\end{cases} \) 
c) F(t) = \(\begin{cases}
0 & for & 0 < t < \overline{t}, \\
1 & for & t > \overline{t}\\
\end{cases} \) 
d) F(t) = \(\begin{cases}
∞ & for & 0 < t < \overline{t}, \\
1 & for & t > \overline{t}\\
\end{cases} \) 
c
5. Which of the following represents area under the C – curve? (Where, M is the total amount of tracer injected and
v is the volumetric flow rate of the effluent)
a) \(\frac{M}{v} \) 
b) \(\frac{v}{M} \) 
c) M × v
d) M × V
a
