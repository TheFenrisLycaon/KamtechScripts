1. Which of the following is NOT a part of reactor design?
a) Size of the reactor
b) Type of the reactor
c) Flow rates of the reactant and product streams
d) Method of operation
c
2. Choose the correct option.
a) Batch reactors are used in laboratories for calorimetric titrations
b) The steady state flow reactor is the most widely used because it needs little supporting equipment
c) Batch reactors are ideal for fast reactions
d) In the steel industry, semi batch reactors are used for large open hearth furnaces
d
3. For any type of reactor, the material balance equation is valid.
[Rate of reactant flowing into element of volume] = [Rate of reactant flowing out of element of volume] + [Rate of reactant loss due to chemical reaction within the volume element] + [Rate of accumulation of reactant in the volume element] 
Which of the following is false?
a) Two terms disappear in case of a batch reactor
b) Only three terms are non-trivial when we analyze a semi batch reactor
c) One term becomes zero for a steady-state flow reactor
d) There is no flow of reactants in a batch reactor
b
4. Consider the liquid reaction 3A + 2B → 4C
What could be the outlet composition if CAo = 100 mol/L in a batch reactor and the feed is an equimolar mixture of A and B? Assume that 5 mol of C was already present in the reactor initially.
a) XA = 0.2, CB = 86.66, Cc = 31.66
b) XA = 0.4, CB = 76.66, Cc = 58.33
c) XA = 0.6, CB = 60, Cc = 80
d) XA = 0.8, CB = 43.33, Cc = 106.66
a
CB = CAo*(1 – 2*XA/3)
Cc = CAo*(5/100 + 4*XA/3)
5. Consider the gas reaction A + B → 3C
Which of the following cannot be the outlet composition if FAo = 100 mol/s in a flow reactor with vo = 10 L/s and the feed is an equimolar mixture of A and B? Take the initial conditions as 1 atm, 273K and outlet condition as 2 atm, 300K.
a) XA = 0.2, CB = 13.23, Cc = 5.45
b) XA = 0.4, CB = 9.1, Cc = 18.2
c) XA = 0.6, CB = 5.6, Cc = 25.19
d) XA = 0.8, CB = 2.6, Cc = 31.19
a
CB = [FAo*(1 – XA)/(1 + 0.5*XA)]*[273/150*vo] 
Cc = [FAo*(3*XA)/(1 + 0.5*XA)]*[273/150*vo] 
6. Percy prepares vegetable curry (liquid) in a pressure cooker. If the raw potatoes are P, the raw tomatoes are T, the raw onions are O, and the cooked meal is M, then 2P + T + O → 3M may represent the cooking process. Sometime during the process, Manu opens the lid and checks the curry to find that the potatoes are half-cooked (take XP = 0.5). Volume of the cooker is 5L and CPo = CTo = COo = 1.5. What can you say about the composition in the cooker at the instant of time when the lid is opened, if initial temperature was 310K?
a) XT = 0.35
b) CO = 1.125
c) T = 380K
d) CM = 2.5
b
XT = CAo*b*XA/(a*CBo)
CO = CAo*(1-0.5*XA)
CM = CAo*(3*XA)
It is a liquid reaction so change in volume can be ignored. Thus we cannot say anything about the temperature based on the given information.
