1. The equation representing the variation of rate constant with respect to temperature by Arrhenius equation is ____
a) ln(\(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\)) = –\(\frac{E}{R}  (\frac{1}{T_2} – \frac{1}{T_1}) \) 
b) ln(\(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\)) = \(\frac{E}{R}  (\frac{1}{T_2} – \frac{1}{T_1}) \) 
c) ln(\(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\)) = –\(\frac{E}{R}  (\frac{1}{T_1}- \frac{1}{T_2}) \) 
d) ln(\(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\)) = –\(\frac{E}{R}  (\frac{1}{T_2} + \frac{1}{T_1}) \) 
a
For two different temperatures, T1 and T2, the Arrhenius equation is reduced as ln(\(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\)) = –\(\frac{E}{R}(\frac{1}{T_2} – \frac{1}{T_1}). \)
