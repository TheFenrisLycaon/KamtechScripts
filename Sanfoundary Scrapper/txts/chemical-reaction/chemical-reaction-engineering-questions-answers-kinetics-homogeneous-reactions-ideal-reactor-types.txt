c
2. State true or false.
There is no axial mixing in a plug flow reactor.
a) True
b) False
a
3. State true or false.
The average concentration of product is low inside a CSTR.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Which of the following is true for a reaction occurring in a batch reactor?
a) The accumulation term is zero
b) Only the component input term is zero
c) Only the component output term is zero
d) Both the component input and output terms are zero
d
5. Which one of the following combinations gives the highest conversion for second order reaction?
a) PFR followed by smaller CSTR followed by a bigger CSTR
b) PFR followed by bigger CSTR followed by a bigger CSTR
c) Smaller CSTR followed by PFR followed by a bigger CSTR
d) Bigger CSTR followed by a PFR followed by smaller CSTR
a
6. For a PFR, the area under the curve \(\frac{1}{-r_A}\) vs XA gives ____
a) \(\frac{F_{A_0}}{dV} \) 
b) \(\frac{dV}{F_{A_0}} \) 
c) dVCA0
d) dVFA0
b
7. The performance equation of a CSTR is ____
a) \(\frac{F_{A_0}}{V} = \frac{(-r_A)}{X_A} \) 
b) \(\frac{F_{A_0}}{V} = \frac{X_A}{(r_A)} \) 
c) \(\frac{V}{X_A} = \frac{(-r_A)}{F_{A_0}} \) 
d) \(\frac{F_{A_0}}{V} = \frac{X_A}{-r_A} \) 
a
FA0 = FA + (-rA)V
FA0 = FA0(1- XA) + (-rA)V
Hence, FA0XA = (-rA)V.
8. The performance equation of a PFR is ____
a) \(\frac{F_{A_0}}{dV} = \frac{dX_A}{(-r_A)} \) 
b) \(\frac{dV}{F_{A_0}} = \frac{(-r_A)}{dX_A} \) 
c) \(\frac{F_{A_0}}{dV} = \frac{(-r_A)}{dX_A} \) 
d) \(\frac{F_{A_0}}{dX_A} = \frac{(-r_A)}{dV} \) 
c
The reaction is integrated in the entire volume of reactor. The material balance is carried out in a small differential volume dV.
9. If the conversion of a first order liquid phase reaction occurring in a CSTR is 75%, molar feed rate is 5 mol/min, the rate of the reaction is 5 \(\frac{mol}{litre.min} \) then the volume of the reactor (in litre) is ____
a) 0.5
b) 0.75
c) 0.33
d) 0.4
b
FA0 is molar feed rate and XA is the fractional conversion
5 × 0.75 = 5 × V
V = 0.75 L
10. If CA is the final concentration and CA0 is the initial concentration, the conversion of a reaction is expressed as ____
a) \(\frac{C_{A0}-C_A}{(C_{A0})} \) 
b) \(\frac{C_{A0}-C_A}{(-r_A)}\)V
c) \(\frac{C_{A0}-C_A}{(-r_A)V} \) 
d) \(\frac{C_A}{(C_{A0})} \) 
a
