1. Which of the following is true for gas phase reactions?
a) Increase in moles of product increases the volume of the reaction mixture
b) Increase in moles of product decreases the volume of the reaction mixture
c) Decrease in moles of product increases the volume of the reaction mixture
d) Increase in moles of product does not affect the volume of the reaction mixture
a
2. For an ideal gas at any given temperature and pressure, the ideal gas law is used to express ____
a) Concentration of gas molecules
b) Mobility of gas molecules
c) Kinetic energy of gas molecules
d) Potential energy of gas molecules
a
Where, P – Pressure
T – Temperature
R – Universal gas constant
n – Number of gas moles
V – Volume
Concentration is the number of moles per unit volume = \(\frac{n}{V} = \frac{P}{RT}. \)

b) 3A → B
c) A → 4B
d) 2A → B
c
