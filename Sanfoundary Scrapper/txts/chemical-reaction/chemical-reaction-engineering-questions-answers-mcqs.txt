1. How should the two MFR’s of unequal size be connected in series to maximize production for a first order homogenous reaction?
a) Smaller MFR followed by larger MFR
b) Larger MFR followed by smaller MFR
c) Any arrangement
d) MFR’s should not be connected in series
c
CA2 = \(\frac{CA0}{(τ1K+1)(τ2k+1)} \) 
Hence, it can be inferred that for first order reactions, irrespective of the arrangements the final conversions are going to be the same.
2. For all positive reaction orders and any particular duty the MFR is always larger than the PFR.
a) True
b) False
a
3. How should a PFR and MFR be connected to maximize production from a first order reaction?
a) MFR followed by PFR
b) PFR followed by MFR
c) Any arrangement
d) MFR and PFR should not be connected
c
CA2 = \(\frac{CA0 e^{-kτp}}{(τmk+1)} \) 
Therefore, any arrangement does not make any difference for first order reactions.
4. Graphical procedure for finding conversion in MFR’s of different sizes in series is called ______ method.
a) Newton’s
b) Wheeler’s
c) Octaves
d) Jones
d
5. Best arrangement of reactors for a reaction whose rate-concentration curve that rises monotonically.
a) Plug, Large MFR, Small MFR
b) Plug, Small MFR, Large MFR
c) Large MFR, Small MFR, Plug
d) Small MFR, Plug, Large MFR
b
6. Determine the space time of a PFR for the given reaction-concentration curve where the concentration is to be reduced from 1.6 to 0.4 mol/lit in minutes.
a) 5
b) 9
c) 19
d) 32
c
τ = \(\int_{CA0}^{CAf}\frac{-dCA}{-rA} \) 
Therefore, the area under the curve in a 1/-rA vs CA gives the space time.
7. Find the size of the MFR in litres required to achieve 40% conversion for a flowrate of 100 lit/min.
a) 10.68
b) 15.83
c) 3.45
d) 7.65
d
\(\frac{τ}{CA0} = \frac{XA}{-rA} \) 
A rectangle is to be drawn as shown in the fig below. And the area of the rectangle gives the space time.
τ = \(\frac{V}{v0} \)  
From graph space time was found to be 0.0765 minutes.
So V = 0.0765*100 = 7.65 lit.
8. Four MFR’s are operated in series the total space time is 5 minutes. If it is replaced by a single PFR, What will be the space time? First order reaction with rate constant 2 min-1, concentration reduces from 50 to 10 mol/m3.
a) 0.805
b) 0.123
c) 0562
d) 0.439
a
For the 1st order reaction the equation is simplified as kτ = -ln⁡(\(\frac{CA}{CA0}\))
τ = -0.5ln⁡(\(\frac{10}{50}\)) = 0.805 minutes.
9. Effect of flow type on reactor performance when the conversion is small.
a) no effect
b) cannot be determined
c) very small
d) very large
c
10. The concentration profile shown is for __________
a) MFR in series
b) MFR
c) PFR in series
d) PFR
a
