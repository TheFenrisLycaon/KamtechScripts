1. State true or false.
Kinetics of microbial fermentation cannot be expressed by Monod kinetics.
a) True
b) False
b
Rate of growth rC = \(\frac{kC_A C_C}{C_A+ C_M}.\) The reaction is A \(^{\underrightarrow{C}}\) C + R. The substrate in the presence of microbial cells gives more cells and the waste, R.
2. The plot representing the slope of growth curve and CA is ____
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
3. The hierarchy of phases for the microbes in a fermentation process is ____
a) Exponential growth phase  →  Lag phase  →  Stationary phase  →  Death phase
b) Stationary phase  →  Lag phase  →  Exponential growth phase  →  Death phase
c) Lag phase  →  Exponential growth phase  →  Stationary phase  →  Death phase
d) Lag phase  →  Stationary phase  →  Exponential growth phase  →  Death phase
c
4. The substrate limiting kinetics of A \(^{\underrightarrow{C}}\) C + R is the one in which ___
a) Final concentration of C depends on initial amount of food
b) Final concentration of C does not depend on initial amount of food
c) Final concentration of C does not exceed a certain value
d) The rate depends on enzyme concentration
a
5. The poison limiting kinetics of A \(^{\underrightarrow{C}}\) C + R is the one in which ___

6. The plot representing the maximum final cell concentration and initial concentration of food in a batch fermenter is ____
a)
b) 
c) 
d) 
d
7. In a batch fermenter, for substrate limiting kinetics, CC,max  is ________
a) Independent of CA0
b) Directly proportional to CA0
c) Inversely proportional to CA0
d) Proportional to the square of CA0
b
8. With an accumulation of waste formed during the reaction, the value of observed Monod rate constant ____
a) Decreases
b) Increases
c) Remains constant
d) First decreases and then increases
a
9. The relationship between the Monod rate constant, k and the rate constant observed due to waste accumulation kobs is ____
a) kobs = k (1-\(\frac{C_R}{C_R^*}\))n
b) kobs = k (1-\(\frac{C_R}{C_R^*})^\frac{1}{n}\) 
c) k = kobs (1-\(\frac{C_R}{C_R^*}\))n
d) kobs = k (\(\frac{C_R}{C_R^*}\))n
CR* is the concentration of R where cell activity stops and n is the order of product poisoning.
a
The buildup of harmful wastes interferes with the cell multiplication. The observed rate constant decreases with a rise in CR.
10. The fractional yield of C with respect to A for the reaction A \(^{\underrightarrow{C}}\) cC + rR is the ratio of ____
a) All R formed to all A reacted
b) All A reacted to all R formed
c) All A reacted to all C formed
d) All C formed to all A reacted
d
