1. The unit for rate of reaction for a fluid-solid catalytic reaction is _______
a) mol/m3.s
b) mol/s. g catalyst
c) mol/s. mmHg
d) mol/dm3.s
b
2. Chemical reaction rate is ___________
a) an extensive property
b) an intensive property
c) a chemical property
d) a physical property
b
3. –rA is a universal notation for reaction rate. What does the negative sign indicate?
a) Rate of formation of A
b) Rate of disappearance of A
c) Rate of dissociation of A
d) Rate of association of A
b
4. General mole balance equation of species ‘i’ at any instant is as follows: ________
a) Rate of moles of ‘i’ in = Rate of moles of ‘i’ out
b) Rate of moles of ‘i’ in + Rate of moles of ‘i’ out = Rate of moles of ‘i’ accumulated
c) Rate of moles of ‘i’ in + Rate of moles of ‘i’ accumulated = Rate of moles ‘i’ out
d) Rate of moles of ‘i’ in – Rate of moles of ‘i’ consumed by reaction – Rate of moles of ‘i’ out = Rate of moles of ‘i’ accumulated
d
IN – OUT + Generation – Consumption = Accumulation.
5. Mole balance equation for a perfectly mixed batch reactor is _______
a) \(\frac{dNi}{dt}\) = 0
b) \(\frac{dNi}{dt}\) = ri V
c) \(\frac{dNi}{dt} = \int_0^V\)ri dV
d) \(\frac{dNi}{dt}\) = ri
b
ri = \(\frac{1}{V} \frac{dNi}{dt}. \)
