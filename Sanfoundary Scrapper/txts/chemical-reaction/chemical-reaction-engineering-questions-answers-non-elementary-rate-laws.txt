1. Which of the following reactions follows elementary rate law?
a) Formation of hydrogen bromide
b) Vapor phase decomposition of ethanal
c) Cis-trans isomerization
d) Reversible catalytic decomposition of isopropylbenzene
c
2. Langmuir Hinshelwood kinetics is followed by the reaction:
a) Formation of hydrogen bromide
b) Vapor phase decomposition of ethanal
c) Cis-trans isomerization
d) Reversible catalytic decomposition of isopropylbenzene
d
Let’s represent this reaction symbolically as  C ←→ B + P
the reaction follows the rate law  -r’C = [k(PC – PBPP/KP)] / [1 + KCPC + KBPB] which is the Langmuir Hinshelwood model.
3. Which of the following is true for fluidized catalytic beds?
a) They cannot be used for multi-phase chemical reactions
b) The bulk density is a function of the flow rate through the bed
c) They come under the category of batch reactors
d) There is no pressure drop
b
4. The reaction H2 + Br2 → 2HBr proceeds via which mechanism?
a) Free-radical
b) Ionic substitution
c) Elimination
d) Pericyclic
a
5. Which of the following does not hold true for gas-solid catalyzed reactions?
a) Rate law is preferably written in terms of partial pressures
b) Rate law is preferably written in terms of concentrations
c) Rate law can be written only in terms of partial pressures
d) Rate law can be written only in terms of concentrations
a
6. For the reaction A + 2B ←→ C, what is the value of KC if the rate law is given by
–rA = k(CA2/3/CB – KCCC)? Given that initial concentration of A is equal to that of B = 5M and the equilibrium conversion of B is found to be 0.3. k = 100.
a) Kc = 0
b) Kc = 0.5
c) Kc = 1
d) Kc = 1.5
c
CA = CAo(1 – XA)
CB = CAo(1 – 2XA)
CC = CAoXA
At equilibrium, take –rA equal to 0 and solve for KC.
