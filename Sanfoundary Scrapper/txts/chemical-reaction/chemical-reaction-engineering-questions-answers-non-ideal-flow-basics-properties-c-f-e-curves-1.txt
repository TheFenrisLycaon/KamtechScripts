1. If M is the total amount of tracer injected and v is the volumetric flow rate of the effluent, then what is the Relationship between cumulative and exit age distribution?
a) E = \(\frac{C}{(\frac{M}{v})} \) 
b) E = \(\frac{M}{(v)} \) 
c) E = \(\frac{C}{(Mv)} \) 
d) E = \(\frac{MC}{(v)} \) 
a
Edt = \(\frac{C}{(\frac{M}{v})} \)dt
E = \(\frac{C}{(\frac{M}{v})}. \)
2. State true or false.
The time spent by different fluid elements in the reactor is measured by a technique called the stimulus–response technique.
a) False
b) True
b
3. State true or false.
The average residence time (t) of a fluid element is given by t = ʃ tF(t)dt, integrated between time t = 0 and t = ∞.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Exit age distribution and F(t) are related as ____
a) \(\frac{dF}{dt}\) = E
b) \(\frac{dE}{dt}\) = F
c) F × t = E
d) E × V = F
a
5. Which of the following correctly represents the exit age distribution of a CSTR?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
b
6. Which of the following correctly represents the exit age distribution of a PFR?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
d
7. The average residence time obtained from cumulative age distribution is ____
a) τ = \(\frac{ʃtC(t)dt}{ʃ C(t)dt} \) 
b) τ = ʃ tC(t)dt
c) τ = \(\frac{ʃ tC(t)dt}{ʃ dt} \) 
d) τ = \(\frac{ʃ C(t)dt}{ʃ tC(t)dt} \) 
a
8. The average residence time obtained from exit age distribution is ____
a) τ = t2ʃ tC(t)dt
b) τ = \(\int_0^∞\)E(t)dt
c) τ = \(\frac{ʃ tE(t)dt}{ʃ E(t)dt}\) 
d) τ = \(\frac{ʃ tC(t)dt}{ʃ dt}\) 
b
Hence, τ=\(\int_0^∞\)E(t)dt.

a) 0
b) 2
c) Unity
d) Infinite
c

a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
c
