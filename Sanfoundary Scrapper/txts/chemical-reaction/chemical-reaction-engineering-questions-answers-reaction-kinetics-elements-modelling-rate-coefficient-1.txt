1. The value of rate constant for a zero order reaction is obtained by the plot between ____
a) Concentration vs time
b) Concentration vs rate
c) Rate vs time
d) Concentration vs rate
a
Integrating the above equation between initial concentration CA0 and final concentration CA, (CA0 – CA)=kt
The slope of the graph of concentration vs time gives the rate constant for a zero order reaction.
2. Which of the following theories does not propose the temperature dependence of rate constant?
a) Arrhenius theory
b) Collision theory
c) Transition state theory
d) Bohr’s theory
d
3. Which among the following graphs represents a zero order reaction?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
4. For a first order reaction, the rate constant as a function of half life is given as ____
a) \(\frac{0.6931}{k} \) 
b) 0.6931×k
c) 0.6931
d) \(\frac{k}{0.6931} \) 
a
t0.5 = \(\frac{0.6931}{k}.\) 
5. The rate constant is a ____
a) Linear function of frequency factor
b) Exponential function of frequency factor
c) Logarithmic function of frequency factor
d) Sinusoidal function of frequency factor
a
K varies directly with respect to the frequency factor, A.

6. For any order n, the rate constant is expressed as ____
a) (-rA)
b) (-rA) × CAn
c) (-rA) × CA
d) \(\frac{-r_A}{C_A^n} \) 
d
7. For a reaction with negative order n, which one of the following is true about reaction rate constant?
a) k = (-rA)
b) k = 1
c) k = \(\frac{-r_A}{C_A^n} \) 
d) k =  (-rA) × CAn
d
Hence, k = (-rA) × CAn
8. Which among the following is true for liquid phase reactions of order n?
a) ln(\(\frac{-dC}{dt}\)) = lnk + n(lnC)
b) ln(\(\frac{-dC}{dt}\)) = lnk + lnC
c) ln(\(\frac{-dC}{dt}\)) = nlnk + lnC
d) ln(\(\frac{-dC}{dt}\)) = lnk + \(\frac{lnC}{n} \) 
a
Taking natural logarithm on both sides, ln(\(\frac{-dC}{dt}\)) = lnk + n(lnC)
9. For a first order reaction, the rate constant is expressed in terms of initial concentration CAo and final concentration CA as ____
a) CA = CAo × k
b) CA = CAo × e-kt
c) CA = CAo × kt
d) CA = CAo × ekt
b
ln(\(\frac{CAo}{CA}\)) = kt
CA = CAo × e-kt
10. If rate of a zero order reaction is 10 \(\frac{mol}{m^3×s}\) and reaction time is 5s, then the value of rate constant is ____
a) 1 s-1
b) 2 s-1
c) 5 s-1
d) 10 s-1
b
10 = k (5)
Hence, k = 2 s-1.
