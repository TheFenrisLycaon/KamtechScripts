a) 10-3-10-4
b) 102
c) 0.1
d) 109
a

a) \(\frac{-r_A}{a}\)=\(\frac{-r_B}{b}\) ≤ \(\frac{r_R}{r} \) 
b) \(\frac{-r_A}{a}\) ≥\(\frac{-r_B}{b}\) ≤ \(\frac{r_R}{r} \) 
c) \(\frac{-r_A}{a}\)=\(\frac{-r_B}{b}\) ≤ \(\frac{r_R}{r} \) 
d) \(\frac{-r_A}{a}\)≤\(\frac{-r_B}{b}\) ≤ \(\frac{r_R}{r} \) 
c
5. The rate of a reaction cannot be expressed in terms of ____
a) Volume of reacting fluid
b) Volume of solid
c) Amount of product
d) Interfacial surface
c
6. Order of a reaction is ____
a) Number of molecules of reactants taking part in the reaction
b) Power of any one of the reactant concentrations
c) Concentration of intermediate species formed
d) Sum of the powers of the concentrations of all the reactants
d
7. The rate expression for a homogeneous reaction comprises of ____
a) A concentration dependent term only
b) A temperature dependent term only
c) A concentration dependent term and a temperature dependent term
d) A catalyst weight dependent term
c
Where,
k: Rate constant
C: Concentration
Rate constant, k is a function of temperature.
8. The number of molecules involved in an elementary reaction is termed as ____
a) Molecularity
b) Order of reaction
c) Unimolecular reaction
d) Rate of reaction
a
9. Which of the following is true about elementary reactions?
a) They occur in multiple steps
b) They are complex in nature
c) Order of elementary reaction is an integer
d) All first order reactions are elementary
c
10. The unit of frequency factor in Arrhenius equation is ____
a) \(\frac{mol}{m^3} \) 
b) Same as that of rate constant
c) \(\frac{mol}{m^3×s} \) 
d) mol
b
Arrhenius equation is, k = A e-Ea/RT,
k: Rate constant
A: Frequency factor
The exponent term in Arrhenius equation gives an integer. Hence, unit of A depends on that of k.
