1. Choose the correct rate law for the elementary reversible reaction 3A ⇌ B + 2C.
a) –rA = kCA3 – CBCC2/KC
b) –rA = k[CA3 – CBCC2KC] 
c) –rA = k[CA3 – CBCC2]/KC
d) –rA = k[CA3 – CBCC2/KC] 
d
Rate of disappearance of A = k1CA3
Rate of formation of A = k2CBCC2
-rA = k1CA3 – k2CBCC2. We know that KC = k1/k2. So, -rA = k[CA3 – CBCC2/KC].
2. Choose the correct rate law for the set of elementary reactions.
     2A ⇌ B + C		[k1,-k2] 
     A + 5B → 6D		[k3] 
     3C + 2D + B ⇌ 6E	[k4, -k5] 
     5A + 3E ⇌ 2R	[k6] 
a) –rA = k1CA2 – k2CB2CC – k3CACB5 – k6CA5CE3
b) –rA = k1CA2 – k2CB2CC + k3CACB5 – k6CA5CE3
c) –rA = k1k4CACCCD – k2k5CE3 + k3k6CA6CB5CE3
d) –rA = k1k4CACCCD – k2k5CE3 – k3k6CA6CB5CE3
b
Rate of disappearance of A = k1CA2 + k3CACB5 + k6CA5CE3
Rate of formation of A = k2CBCC
3. The equilibrium constant increases when _____________
a) Initial concentration of reactant increases in endothermic reactions
b) Initial concentration of reactant decreases in endothermic reactions
c) Temperature increases in exothermic reactions
d) Temperature decreases in exothermic reactions
d
4. For the reaction ½ A + 3B → 2C
the specific reaction rate will be maximum for which species?
a) A
b) B
c) C
d) Equal for all species
b
kB = 3kC/2 = 6kA.
Thus, kB has the biggest of the three rate constant values.
