a) ΔCT = 28, X – Ray = 571.4285HU
b) CT = 571.4285HU, X – Ray = 2.304HU
c) CT = 2.304HU, ΔX-Ray  = 2.304
d) CT = 2.304HU, X – Ray = 571.4285HU
b
For CT
 ΔCT = l1 – l2
     = 63 – 35
     = 28
HU for CT = (l1 – l2)X 1000/(l1 + l2)/2
                  = (63 – 35)X 1000/(63 + 35)/2
                  = 571.4285HU
For X – Ray
ΔX-Ray = Σl1 – Σl2
              = 1738 – 1734
              = 4
HU for X – Ray  = (Σl1 – Σl2)X1000/(Σl1 + Σl2)/2
= (1738 – 1734)X1000/(1738 + 1734)/2
              = 2.304HU.
