1. The commonly used MRI’s have a magnetic strength of ______
a) 1.5 – 3 Tesla
b) 3 – 6 Tesla
c) 6 – 12 Tesla
d) 12 – 24 Tesla
a
2. The cooling agent for the MRI magnet is _______
a) Helium
b) Neon
c) Argon
d) Xenon
a
3. If an MRI was done for a long bone, the part of the bone that will be imaged is the _________
a) Bone salts
b) Bony Prominence
c) Inflamed Joints
d) Bone Marrow
d
4. A hypothetical MRI is made having a magnetic field (B0) of 7 Tesla. This uses nitrogen for study. The gyrometric ratio of nitrogen 15 is -4.316. Find the Lamar frequency.
a) -35.889
b) – 30.212
c) 0
d) -189.812
b
Here γn/2Π is the gyrometric ratio. Thus,
 f  =  -4.316*7 = -30.212.

c) is of a size bigger than normal
d) has shrunk
b
9. The scans for lissencephaly will show a brain _______
a) with no gyri and sulci
b) with excess gyri and sulci
c) with deformed brain structure
d) with a smaller than normal brain size
a
10. Frontotemporal Dementia brain scan shows a __________
