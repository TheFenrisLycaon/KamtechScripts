d) > 1000 rad
d
10. What is the relation between 1 Rad, 1 Rem and 1 R?
a) 1 Rad ≈ 1.5 Rem ≈ 1000 R
b) 1 Rad ≈ 10 Rem ≈ 1.8 R
c) 1 Rad ≈ 1 Rem ≈ 1 R

c
11. The two known units of radioactivity and the relation between the two are _______
a) Curie and Becquerel 1 Ci = 3.7 x 1010 Bq
b) Curie and Becquerel 1 Bq = 3.7 x 1010 Ci
c) Curie and Roentgens   1 Ci = 1000 R
d) Roentgen and Becquerel  1 R = 1000 Bq
a
12. In a hypothetical radioactive material, the total number of active photons are 20000 and the decay constant is found out to be 4.916 X 10-17 per second. How much of the material will be left in a 100 years? (1 year = 365 days. Leap year is not assumed in the calculations)
a) 1589.99999
b) 19,999.9999
c) 19.999999
d) 123.99999
b
N = 20000 * e(- (4.916* 10-17) * 365*100*24*60*60)= 19999.99999.
13. If the half life is found to be 100 msec, what is the decay constant?
a) 693 per second
b) 24948 per hour
c) 0.1155 per minute
d) 59875.2 per day
b
t 1/2 = 0.693/λ
Since the half life is given in seconds, appropriate conversions are used for hours, minutes and day. By this, we get:
λ = 0.693*3600/t1/2 = 249480 per hour.
