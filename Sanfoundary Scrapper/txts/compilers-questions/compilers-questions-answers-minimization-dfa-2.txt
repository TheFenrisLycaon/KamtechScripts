1. The language accepted by this DFA is?
a) b*ab*ab*ab*
b) (a+b)*
c) b*a(a+b)*
d) b*ab*ab*
c
2. The minimum state automation equivalent to the below FSA has the following number of states?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
 Following is equivalent FSA with 2 states.
3. Which one of the following is TRUE?
a) The language L={a^n b^n |n>0 } is regular
b) The language L={a^n  |n is prime } is regular
c) The language L={w|w has 3k+1 b’s for some k } is regular
d) None of the mentioned
c
4. 
a) q0, q1,q2
b) q0,q1
c) q0,q1,q2,q3
d) q3
a
5. Which of the regular expressions given below represent the following DFA?
I) 0*1(1+00*1)*
II) 0*1*1+11*0*1
III) (0+1)*1
a) I and II only
b) I and III only
c) II and III only
d) I II III
b
II) 0*1*1+11*0*1
III) (0+1)*1 
(I) and  (III) represent DFA.
(II) doesn’t represent  the DFA since it  accepts strings like 11011,
    but the regular expression doesn’t accept. 
6. Let L1 = {w ∈ {0,1}∗ | w has at least as many occurrences of (110)’s as (011)’s}.
Let L2 = { ∈ {0,1}∗ | w has at least as many occurrences of (000)’s as (111)’s}.
Which one of the following is TRUE?
a) L1 is regular but not L2
b) L2 is regular
c) L1 and L2 are regular
d) Neither of them are regular
A
7. The length of the shortest string NOT in the language (over Σ = {a, b}) of the following regular expression is _____________
a*b*(ba)*a*
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
B
8. Consider the machine M:  The language recognized by M is :
a) {w ∈ {a, b}* / every a in w is followed by ex¬actly two b’s}
b) {w ∈ {a, b}* every a in w is followed by at least two b’}
c) {w ∈ {a, b}* w contains the substring ‘abb’}
d) {w ∈ {a, b}* w does not contain ‘aa’ as a substring}
b
9. Consider the following deterministic finite state automaton M.
S denotes the set of seven bit in which the 1st ,4th and last bits are 1. The number of strings that are accepted by M is
a) 1
b) 5
c) 7
d) 8
c
