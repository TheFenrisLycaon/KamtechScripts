a) strings with the substring 00
b) strings with at most two 0’s
c) strings with at least two 0’s
d) strings beginning and ending with either 0 or 1
c
3. Which one is a FALSE statement?
a) There exists a unique DFA for every regular language
b) NFA can always are converted to a PDA
c) Complement of CFL is always recursive
d) Every NDFA can be converted to a DFA
d
4. Match the following.
      Group 1                       Group 2
P. Regular expression        1. Syntax analysis
Q. Pushdown automata         2. Code generation
R. Dataflow analysis         3. Lexical analysis
S. Register allocation       4. Code optimization
a) P-4. Q-1, R-2, S-3
b) P-3, Q-1, R-4, S-2
c) P-3, Q-4, R-1, S-2
d) P-2, Q-1, R-4, S-3
b
Pushdown automata relates to Syntax analysis
Data flow analysis is Code optimization
Register allocation is code generation.
5. Let L = L1 ∩ L2, where L1 and L2 are languages as defined below.

L1 = {ambmcanbn | m, n >= 0 }
L2 = {aibjck | i, j, k >= 0 }
Then L is?
a) Not recursive
b) Regular
c) Context free but not regular
d) None of the mentioned
c
6. Convert the NFA to DFA.
a) 
b) 
c) All of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned
a
Since  2( 0 , a ) = { 1 , 2 } , { 1 , 2 } is added to Q and  ( { 0 } , a ) = { 1 , 2 }.
Since  2( 0 , b ) =   ,   is added to Q and  ( { 0 } , b ) =   .
At this point Q = { {0} , { 1 , 2 },   }. Similarly  ( { 1 , 2 } , b ) = { 1 , 3 } . Hence { 1 , 3 } is added to Q . Similarly  ( { 1 , 3 } , a ) = { 1 , 2 } and  ( { 1 , 3 } , b ) =   . Thus there are no new states to be added to Q . Since the transitions from all states of Q have been computed and no more states are added to Q, the conversion process stops here. 
7. Does epsilon ring any change in the automata.
a) Yes
b) No
b
