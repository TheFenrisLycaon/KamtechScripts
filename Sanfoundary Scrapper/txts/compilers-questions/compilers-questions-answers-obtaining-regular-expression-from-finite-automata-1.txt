1. L1 is accepted by the NFA, obtained by changing the accepting state of M to a non-accepting state and vice versa. Which of the following statements is true?
a) L1 = {0, 1}* – L
b) L1 = {0, 1}* – L
c) L1 ⊆ L
d) L1=L
b
2. Given an arbitrary non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) with N states, the maximum number of states in an equivalent minimized DFA is at least?
a) N2
b) 2N
c) 2N
d) N!
c
3. What can be said about a regular language L over {a} whose minimal finite state automaton has two states?
a) L must be {an| n is odd}
b) L must be {an| n is even}
c) L must be {an| n is even}
d) Either L must be {an | n is odd}, or L must be {an | n is even}
d
4. How many minimum states are required to find whether a string has odd number of 0’s or not?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
5. The number of states in DFA that accepts the language L(M) ∩ L(N) is _________
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) 3
b
6. Consider alphabet ∑ = {0, 1}, the null/empty string λ and the sets of strings X0, X1 and X0. How are  X1 and X2 are related?

X0 = 1 X1
X1 = 0 X1 + 1 X2
X2 = 0 X1 + {λ} 
Which one of the following represents the strings in X0?
a) 10 (0* + (10)*)1
b) 10 (0* + (10)*)*1
c) 10 (0* + (10)*)*1
d) 10 (0 + 10)*1 + 110 (0 + 10)*1
c
X0 = 1X1
   = 11X2  [Replacing X1 with 1X2] 
   = 11    [Replacing X2 with λ] 
The string “11” is only possible with option 10 (0* + (10)*)*1.
7. Which of the following languages is/are regular?

L1: {wxwR ⎪ w, x ∈ {a, b}* and ⎪w⎪, ⎪x⎪ >0} wR is the reverse of string w
L2: {anbm ⎪m ≠ n and m, n≥0}
L3: {apbqcr ⎪ p, q, r ≥ 0}  
a) L1 and L3 only
b) L2
c) L2 and L3 only
d) L3 only
a
Below is DFA for L1.
L1 is interesting. The important thing to note
about L1 is length of x is greater than 0.
8. The reorganizing capability of NDFA and DFA is?
a) May be different
b) Must be different
c) Must be same
d) None of the mentioned
c
9. Which of the following is not regular?
a) String whose length is perfect square and consists of 0s
b) Palindromes consisting  of 0’s and 1’s
c) String whose length is perfect square and consists of 0s & Palindromes consisting  of 0’s and 1’s
d) None of the mentioned
c
10. Which of the following pairs of regular expression are equivalent?
a) 1(01)* and (10)*1
b) X(xx)* and (xx)*x
c) 1(01)* and (10)*1 & X(xx)* and (xx)*x
d) None of the mentioned
c
