i) “abaabaaabaa” can be partitioned as a combination of strings in set {ab, aa, baa}. The partitions are “ab aa baa ab aa”
ii) “aaaabaaaa” can be partitioned as a combination of strings in set {ab, aa, baa}. The partitions are “aa ab aa aa”
iii) “baaaaabaaaab” cannot be partitioned as a combination of strings in set {ab, aa, baa}
iv) “baaaaabaa” can be partitioned as a combination of strings in set {ab, aa, baa}. The partitions are “baa aa ab aa”.
