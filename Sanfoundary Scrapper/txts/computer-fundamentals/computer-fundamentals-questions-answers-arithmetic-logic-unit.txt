1. The ‘heart’ of the processor which performs many different operations _____________
a) Arithmetic and logic unit
b) Motherboard
c) Control Unit
d) Memory
a

a) True
b) False
a
3. Which of the following is not a bitwise operator?
a) |
b) ^
c) .
d) <<
c
|  : Bitwise OR

<< : Shift Left   
4.  The sign magnitude representation of -1 is __________
a) 0001
b) 1110
c) 1000
d) 1001
d
5. IEEE stands for ___________

b
8. Number of bits in ALU is _________
a) 4
b) 8
c) 16
d) 2
c
9. Which flag indicates the number of 1 bit that results from an operation?
a) Zero
b) Parity

10. The bitwise complement of 0 is ___________
a) 00000001
b) 10000000
c) 11111111
d) 11111110
c
So, for 0 = 00000000(in 8-bits) ::: 11111111(1s complement). The bitwise complement is often referred to as the 1s complement.
