1. Which of the following is used for binary multiplication?
a) Restoring Multiplication
b) Booth’s Algorithm
c) Pascal’s Rule
d) Digit-by-digit multiplication
b
2. One extra bit is added on the left of a binary number, in case of Binary Multiplication using Booth’s Algorithm.
a) True
b) False
a
Let us take an example if we multiply 2  * – 3.
The first step is to obtain the binary equivalents.
Hence, 2=10 and -3=01.
Now after adding the extra bit 2=010 and -3=101.
We add 0 in case of positive numbers whereas 1 in negative numbers.
3. The binary number obtained after applying RSC on 11010 will be  ___________
a) 11101
b) 10100
c) 01101
d) 01000
c
4.  The result of  >> of 11001 by 3-bits will be ______________
a) 01000
b) 01111
c) 00011
d) 11111
a
Applying >>(left-shift) by 3-bits on the number 11001 will result in 3 zeroes on the right, i.e., 01000. 
5. Booth’s Algorithm is applied on _____________
a) decimal numbers
b) binary numbers
c) hexadecimal numbers
d) octal Numbers
b
Although, the values of other number systems can be converted to binary, and then the multiplication could be performed.  
6. If Booth’s Multiplication is performed on the numbers 22*3, then what is 3 referred to as __________
a) accumulator
b) multiplicand
c) quotient
d) multiplier
d
7. What is the default value of accumulator in booth’s multiplication of two 4-bit binary numbers?
a) 0
b) 1
c) 0000
d) 00000
d
8. What is the value of n in multiplication of 110* 1000?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 0
c
9. What will be the value obtained after multiplication of (-2) * (-3) using Booth’s Algorithm?
a) 6
b) -6
c) -2
d) -3
a
10. What does the data transfer instruction STA stand for?
a) Store Accumulator
b) Send Accumulator
c) Send Action
d) Store Action
a
