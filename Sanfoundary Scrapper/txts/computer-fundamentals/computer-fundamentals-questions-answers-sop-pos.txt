1. The terms in SOP are called  ___________
a) max terms
b) min terms
c) mid terms
d) sum terms
b
Similarly, POS consists of max terms. 
2. A sum of products expression is a product term (min term) or several min terms ANDed together.
a) True
b) False
b
A sum of products expression is a product term (min term) or several min terms OR ed(i.e. added) together. 
3. Which of the following is an incorrect SOP expression?
a) x+x.y
b) (x+y)(x+z)
c) x
d) x+y
b
This makes it a POS or the product of sum expression.
Other options are valid SOP expressions. 
4.  The corresponding min term when x=0, y=0 and z=1.
a) x.y.z’
b) X’+Y’+Z
c) X+Y+Z’
d) x’.y’.z
d
Here, x=0,y=0 and z=1, then the min term is x’y’z. 
5. LSI stands for  ___________
a) Large Scale Integration
b) Large System Integration
c) Large Symbolic Instruction
d) Large Symbolic Integration
a
It can also be small scale, medium, large or very large scale integration. 
6. Which operation is shown in the following expression: (X+Y’).(X+Z).(Z’+Y’)
a) NOR
b) ExOR
c) SOP
d) POS
c
Also, the terms are ANDed together, therefore it is a POS term. 
7. The number of min terms for an expression comprising of 3 variables?
a) 8
b) 3
c) 0
d) 1
a
Here, n=3 since there are 3 variables therefore, min terms=23=8.  
8. The number of cells in a K-map with n-variables.
a) 2n
b) n2
c) 2n
d) n
c
SOP and POS expressions can be simplified using the K-map.
The number of cells in case of n-variables=2n. 
9. The output of AND gates in the SOP expression is connected using the ________ gate.
a) XOR
b) NOR
c) AND
d) OR
d
Therefore, the OR gate is used to connect the AND gates. 
10. The expression A+BC is the  reduced form of ______________
a) AB+BC
b) (A+B)(A+C)
c) (A+C)B
d) (A+B)C
b
It can simplified as follows: (A+B)(A+C)
=AA+AC+AB+BC
=A+AC+AB+BC
=A(1+C)+AB+BC
=A+AB+BC
=A(1+B)+BC
=A+BC.
