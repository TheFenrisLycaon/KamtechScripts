1. A ____________ is a circuit with only one output but can have multiple inputs.
a) Logic gate
b) Truth table
c) Binary circuit
d) Boolean circuit
a
It can have multiple inputs but can have only one output.
The different types of logic gates are AND, OR, NOT etc.
2. There are 5 universal gates.
a) True
b) False
b
A NAND gate as well as the NOR gate can be used to implement any other Boolean expression thus it is called as a universal gate.
3. The Output is LOW if any one of the inputs is HIGH in case of a _________ gate.
a) NOR
b) NAND
c) OR
d) AND
b
It gives a HIGH output only in one case when all the inputs given to it are LOW.
4.  The following figure shows a ___________ gate.
a) NOR
b) NAND
c) EXOR
d) OR
a
The bubble signifies that it is a NOR gate.
It is a type of universal gate and can be used to implement all the boolean expressions.
5. The complement of the input given is obtained in case of:
a) NOR
b) AND+NOR
c) NOT
d) EX-OR
c
It gives an inverted output, thus gives the complement.
Expression for NOT gate: Y=A’, where A is the input.
6. How many AND gates are required to realize the following expression Y=AB+BC?
a) 4
b) 8
c) 1
d) 2
d
1 AND gate will be used to connect the inputs A and B whereas the other will be used to connect the inputs B and C.
7. Number of outputs in a half adder _____________
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 0
b
One is called the sum and the other is carry.
Half adder can be implemented using an EXOR gate and an AND gate.
8. The ________ gate is an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.
a) NAND
b) EXOR
c) NOR
d) EXNOR
c
It therefore reverses the output obtained by an OR gate.
It can be used to implement any Boolean expression.
9. The expression of a NAND gate is_______
a) A.B
b) A’B+AB’
c) (A.B)’
d) (A+B)’
c
It therefore inverts the output of an AND gate.
NAND gate is also a universal gate.
10. Which of the following correctly describes the distributive law.
a)( A+B)(C+D)=AB+CD
b) (A+B).C=AC+BC
c) (AB)(A+B)=AB
d) (A.B)C=AC.AB
b
(A+B).C =AC+BC.
Boolean Laws are used to implementing and simplifying Boolean expression.
