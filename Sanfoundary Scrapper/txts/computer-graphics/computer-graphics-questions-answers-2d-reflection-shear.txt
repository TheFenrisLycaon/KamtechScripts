1. In a rotation, by how much angle is the object rotated?
a) 45 degree
b) 90 degree
c) 180 degree
d) 360 degree
c
2.  Reflection is a special case of rotation.
a) True
b) False
b
3. If two pure reflections about a line passing through the origin are applied successively the result is ___________________
a) Pure rotation
b) Quarter rotation
c) Half rotation
d) True reflection
a
4. What is the determinant of the pure reflection matrix?
a) 1
b) 0
c) -1
d) 2
c
[T] =   | 1  0 |
         | 0  -1|
So, the determinant will be = (1) (-1) – (0) (0) = 0.
5. Which of the following is NOT true?
Image formed by reflection through a plane mirror is_______________
a) of same size
b) same orientation
c) virtual
d) is at same distance from the mirror
b
