1. What do you mean by workability?
a) ASTM C 125 defines workability as the property determining the effort required to manipulate a freshly mixed quantity of concrete with a maximum loss of homogeneity
b) ASTM C 125 defines workability as the property determining the effort required to manipulate a freshly mixed quantity of concrete with minimum loss of heterogeneity
c) The strict definition of workability is the amount of useful external work, against the external friction between the individual particles in the concrete, necessary to produce full compaction
d) The workability is also defined as the ease with which a freshly mixed concrete can be properly compacted and also that it can be transported, placed, and finished
