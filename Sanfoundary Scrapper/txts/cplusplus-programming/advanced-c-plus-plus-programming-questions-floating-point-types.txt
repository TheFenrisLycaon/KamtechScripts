This section on advanced C++ programming questions focuses on “Floating Point Types”. One shall practice these advanced C++ questions to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walk-in interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our advanced C++ questions come with the detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
