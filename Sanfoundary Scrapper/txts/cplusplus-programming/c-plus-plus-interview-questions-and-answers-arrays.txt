This section on C++ interview questions and answers focuses on “Arrays”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C++ interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of C++ interview questions on “Arrays” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. Which of the following correctly declares an array?
a) int array[10];
b) int array;
c) array{10};
d) array array[10];
a
2. What is the index number of the last element of an array with 9 elements?
a) 9
b) 8
c) 0
d) Programmer-defined
b
3. What is the correct definition of an array?
a) An array is a series of elements of the same type in contiguous memory locations
b) An array is a series of element
c) An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in non-contiguous memory locations
d) An array is an element of the different type
a
4. Which of the following accesses the seventh element stored in array?
a) array[6];
b) array[7];
c) array(7);
d) array;

6. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <stdio.h>    #include<iostream>    using namespace std;    int array1[] = {1200, 200, 2300, 1230, 1543};    int array2[] = {12, 14, 16, 18, 20};    int temp, result = 0;    int main()    {        for (temp = 0; temp < 5; temp++)         {            result += array1[temp];        }        for (temp = 0; temp < 4; temp++)        {            result += array2[temp];        }        cout << result;        return 0;    }
a) 6553
b) 6533
c) 6522
d) 12200
b
Output:
$ g++ array.cpp
$ a.out
6533
7. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <stdio.h>    #include<iostream>    using namespace std;    int main ()    {        int array[] = {0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 5, 3};        int n, result = 0;        for (n = 0; n < 8; n++)         {            result += array[n];        }        cout << result;        return 0;    }
a) 25
b) 26
c) 27
d) 21
c
8. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <stdio.h>    #include<iostream>    using namespace std;    int main()    {        int a = 5, b = 10, c = 15;        int arr[3] = {&a, &b, &c};        cout << *arr[*arr[1] - 8];        return 0;    }
a) 15
b) 18
c) garbage value
d) compile time error
d
cannot convert from ‘int *’ to ‘int’
This is because &a, &b and &c represent int* whereas the array defined is of int type.
9. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <stdio.h>    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    int main()    {        char str[5] = "ABC";        cout << str[3];        cout << str;        return 0;    }
a) ABC
b) ABCD
c) AB
d) AC
a
$ g++ array.cpp
$ a.out
ABC
10. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <stdio.h>    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    int main()    {        int array[] = {10, 20, 30};        cout << -2[array];        return 0;    }
a) -15
b) -30
c) compile time error
d) garbage value
b
$ g++ array.cpp
$ a.out
-30
