This section on C++ interview questions and answers focuses on “References”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walk-in interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C++ interview questions come with the detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of C++ interview questions on “References” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions: 
1. Which value can we not assign to reference?
a) integer
b) floating
c) unsigned
d) null
d

c) A reference value once defined cannot be reassigned
d) Reference is the alternate name of the variable
b
3. Which reference modifier is used to define the reference variable?
a) &
b) $
c) #
d) @
a
4. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    void swap(int &a, int &b);    int main()    {        int a = 5, b = 10;        swap(a, b);        cout << "In main " << a << b;        return 0;    }    void swap(int &a, int &b)    {        int temp;        temp = a;        a = b;        b = temp;        cout << "In swap " << a << b;    }
a) In swap 105 In main 105
b) In swap 105 In main 510
c) In swap 510 In main 105
d) In swap 510 In main 510
a
Output:
$ g++ ref.cpp
$ a.out
In swap 105 In main 105
5. What does a reference provide?
a) Alternate name for the class
b) Alternate name for the variable
c) Alternate name for the pointer
d) Alternate name for the object
b
6. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    int main()    {        int a = 9;        int & aref = a;        a++;        cout << "The value of a is " << aref;        return 0;    }
a) 9
b) 10
c) error
d) 11
b
$ g++ ref1.cpp
$ a.out
10
 
7. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    void print (char * a)    {        cout << a << endl;    }    int main ()    {        const char * a = "Hello world";        print(const_cast<char *> (a) );        return 0;    }
a) Hello world
b) Hello
c) world
d) compile time error
a
Output:
$ g++ ref2.cpp
$ a.out
Hello world
 
8. Identify the correct sentence regarding inequality between reference and pointer.
a) we can not create the array of reference
b) we can create the Array of reference
c) we can use reference to reference
d) we can use variable
a
int &arr[] = {&a, &b, &c};
This will give an error.
