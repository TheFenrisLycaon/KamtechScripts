This section on C++ language interview questions and answers focuses on “Overloaded Function Names”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C++ language interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of C++ language interview questions on “Overloaded Function Names” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. Which of the following permits function overloading on c++?
a) type
b) number of arguments
c) type & number of arguments
d) number of objects
c
int func(int);
float func(float, float)
Here both type and number of arguments are different. 
2. In which of the following we cannot overload the function?
a) return function
b) caller
c) called function
d) main function
a
3. Function overloading is also similar to which of the following?
a) operator overloading
b) constructor overloading
c) destructor overloading
d) function overloading
b
4. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    void print(int i)    {        cout << i;    }    void print(double  f)    {        cout << f;    }    int main(void)    {        print(5);        print(500.263);        return 0;    }
a) 5500.263
b) 500.2635
c) 500.263
d) 500.266
a
Output:
$ g++ over.cpp
$ a.out
5500.263
5. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    int Add(int X, int Y, int Z)    {        return X + Y;    }    double Add(double X, double Y, double Z)    {        return X + Y;    }    int main()    {        cout << Add(5, 6);        cout << Add(5.5, 6.6);        return 0;    }
a) 11 12.1
b) 12.1 11
c) 11 12
d) compile time error
d
6. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    int operate (int a, int b)    {        return (a * b);    }    float operate (float a, float b)    {        return (a / b);    }    int main()    {        int x = 5, y = 2;        float n = 5.0, m = 2.0;        cout << operate(x, y) <<"\t";        cout << operate (n, m);        return 0;    }
a) 10.0	5.0
b) 5.0	2.5
c) 10.0 5
d) 10   2.5
d
Output:
$ g++ over3.cpp
$ a.out
10	2.5
7. Overloaded functions are ________________
a) Very long functions that can hardly run
b) One function containing another one or more functions inside it
c) Two or more functions with the same name but different number of parameters or type
d) Very long functions
c
8. What will happen while using pass by reference?
a) The values of those variables are passed to the function so that it can manipulate them
b) The location of variable in memory is passed to the function so that it can use the same memory area for its processing
c) The function declaration should contain ampersand (& in its type declaration)
d) The function declaration should contain $
b
9. What should be passed in parameters when function does not require any parameters?
a) void
b) blank space
c) both void & blank space
d) tab space
b
10. What are the advantages of passing arguments by reference?
a) Changes to parameter values within the function also affect the original arguments
b) There is need to copy parameter values (i.e. less memory used)
c) There is no need to call constructors for parameters (i.e. faster)
d) All of the mentioned
d
