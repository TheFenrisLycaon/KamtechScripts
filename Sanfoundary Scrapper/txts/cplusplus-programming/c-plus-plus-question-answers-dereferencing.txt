This section on C question bank focuses on “Dereferencing”. One shall practice these questions to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walk-in interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C question bank comes with the detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of C question bank on “Dereferencing” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. Which is used to tell the computer that where a pointer is pointing to?
a) dereference
b) reference
c) heap operations
d) binary operations
a
2. Which is used to do the dereferencing?
a) pointer without asterix
b) value without asterix
c) pointer with asterix
d) value with asterix

3. Pick out the correct option.
a) References automatically dereference without needing an extra character
b) References automatically dereference with an extra character
c) Reference will not dereference
d) Reference automatically dereference with extra space and character
