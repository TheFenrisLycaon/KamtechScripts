This section on C++ quiz focuses on “Large Objects”. One shall practice these quizzes to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walk-in interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C++ quiz comes with the detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of C++ quiz on “Large Objects” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. How to store the large objects in c++ if it extends its allocated memory?
a) memory heap
b) stack
c) queue
d) stack & queue
a
2. When we are using heap operations what do we need to do to save the memory?
a) rename the objects
b) delete the objects after processing
c) both rename & delete the objects
d) add the objects
b
3. Which container in c++ will take large objects?
a) string
b) class
c) vector
d) string & class
c
4. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    class sample    {        public:        sample()         {              cout << "X::X()" << endl;         }        sample( sample const & )         {              cout << "X::X( X const & )" << endl;        }        sample& operator=( sample const & )        {             cout << "X::operator=(X const &)" << endl;        }    };    sample f()     {        sample tmp;        return tmp;    }    int main()     {        sample x = f();        return 0;    }
a) X::operator=(X const &)
b) X::X( X const & )
c) X::X()
d) X::operator
c
Output:
$ g++ large.cpp
$ a.out
X::X()
5. How to stop your program from eating so much ram?
a) Find a way to work with the data one at a time
