This section on C++ questions and puzzles focuses on “Pointer to Function”. One shall practice these questions and puzzles to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walk-in interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These programming puzzles can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C++ questions come with the detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
