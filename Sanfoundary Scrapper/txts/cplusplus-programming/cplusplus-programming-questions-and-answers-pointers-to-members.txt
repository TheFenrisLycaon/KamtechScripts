This section on C++ language interview questions and answers focuses on “Pointers to Members”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C++ language interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of C++ language interview questions on “Pointers to Members” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:

main function and then for value 20, We are passing the value to class and
printing it.
Output:

in the class, It is printing the func1 twice and then it is printing the given
value.
Output:
$ g++ ptm1.cpp

a) 1
b) 2
c) Both 1 & 2
d) 4
c
Output:
$ g++ ptm2.cpp
