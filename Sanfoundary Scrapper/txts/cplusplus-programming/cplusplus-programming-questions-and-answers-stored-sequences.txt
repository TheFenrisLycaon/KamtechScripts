This section on online C++ test focuses on “Stored Sequences”. One shall practice these test questions to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our online C++ test questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of online C++ test questions on “Stored Sequences” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What is meant by sequence point?
a) Represent the point of execution in the program
b) Represent the whole program
c) Represent the beginning of the program
d) Represent the end of the program
a
2. Pick out the correct statement about sequence point.
a) Sequence point will compile the program
b) Sequence point will resolve all the side effects
c) Sequence point will save the program for execution
d) Sequence point will delete the program for execution
b
3. In sequence point, how will the overloaded operators behave like?
a) Function
b) Objects
c) Instance variable
d) Container
a
4. What do input and output objects support?

5. What kind of execution does sequence point allow?
a) Non-overlap
b) Overlap
c) Concurrent
d) Sequence
a
6. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    #include <string>    using namespace std;    int main ()    {        string mys;        char mya[20]= "Hello world";        mys = mya;        cout << mys << '\n';        return 0;    }
a) Hello world
b) Hello
c) Error
d) Runtime error
a
Output:
$ g++ sts.cpp
$ a.out
Hello world
7. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    #include <algorithm>    #include <vector>    using namespace std;    bool IsOdd (int i)     {        return (i % 2) == 1;     }    int main ()     {        vector<int> myvector;        for (int i = 1; i < 10; ++i) myvector.push_back(i);        vector<int> :: iterator bound;        bound = partition (myvector.begin(), myvector.end(), IsOdd);        for (vector<int> :: iterator it = myvector.begin(); it != bound; ++it)            cout << ' ' << *it;        return 0;    }
a) 1 3 5
b) 1 3 9
c) 1 9 3 7
d) 1 9 3 7 5
d

b) After a terminating semicolon
c) It is a beginning statement
d) At the end
b
