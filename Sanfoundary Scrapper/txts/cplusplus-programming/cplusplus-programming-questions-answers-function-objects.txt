This section on C++ programming questions and answers focuses on “Function Objects”. One shall practice these questions to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C++ programming interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of C++ language programming questions on “Function Objects” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. What does the function objects implement?
a) operator
b) operator()
c) operand
d) operand<>
