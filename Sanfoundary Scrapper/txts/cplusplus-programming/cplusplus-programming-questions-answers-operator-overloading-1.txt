1. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
class A
{
	static int a;
    public:
	void show()
        {
		a++;
		cout<<"a: "<<a<<endl;
	}
};
 
int A::a = 5;
 
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	A a;
	return 0;
}
a) Error as a private member a is referenced outside the class
b) Segmentation fault
c) No output
d) Program compiles successfully but gives run-time error
c
2. What happens when objects s1 and s2 are added?
string s1 = "Hello";
string s2 = "World";
string s3 = (s1+s2).substr(5);
a) Error because s1+s2 will result into string and no string has substr() function
b) Segmentation fault as two string cannot be added in C++
c) The statements runs perfectly
d) Run-time error
c
3. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
class A
{
	static int a;
    public:
	A()
        {
		cout<<"Object of A is created\n";
	}
	void show()
        {
		a++;
		cout<<"a: "<<a<<endl;
	}
};
 
class B
{
    public:
};
 
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	A a1, a2;
	A a3 = a1 + a2;
	return 0;
}
a) Runs perfectly
b) Run-time Error
c) Segmentation fault
d) Compile-time Error
d
4. What is operator overloading in C++?
a) Overriding the operator meaning by the user defined meaning for user defined data type
b) Redefining the way operator works for user defined types
c) Ability to provide the operators with some special meaning for user defined data type
d) All of the mentioned
d
5. What is the syntax of overloading operator + for class A?
a) A operator+(argument_list){}
b) A operator[+](argument_list){}
c) int +(argument_list){}
d) int [+](argument_list){}
a
	return_type operator_keywordOperator(argument_list){}
eg.
	A opeartor+(argument_list){}
6. How many approaches are used for operator overloading?
a) 1

b) ||
c) ==
d) [] 
d
10. Which of the following operator can be used to overload when that function is declared as friend function?
a) [] 
b) ()
c) ->
d) |=
d
11. In case of non-static member functions how many maximum object arguments a unary operator overloaded function can take?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 0
d
12. In case of non-static member functions how many maximum object arguments a binary operator overloaded function can take?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 0
a
13. In the case of friend operator overloaded functions how many maximum object arguments a unary operator overloaded function can take?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 0
a
14. In the case of friend operator overloaded functions how many maximum object arguments a binary operator overloaded function can take?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 0
b
15. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
class A
{
	static int a;
 
   public:
	void show()
        {
		a++;
		cout<<"a: "<<a<<endl;
	}
	void operator.()
        {
		cout<<"Objects are added\n";
	}
};
 
class B
{
     public:
};
 
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	A a1, a2;
	return 0;
}
a) Run-time Error
b) Runs perfectly
c) Segmentation fault
d) Compile-time error
