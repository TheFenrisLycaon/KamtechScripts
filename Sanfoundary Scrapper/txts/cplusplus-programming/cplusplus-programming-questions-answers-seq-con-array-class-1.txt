8. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	array<int,5> arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
	cout<<"Printing Using [] operator: ";
	for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
		cout<<arr[i]<<" ";
	}
	cout<<endl;
	cout<<"Printing Using at() function: ";
	for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
		cout<<arr.at(i)<<" ";
	}
	cout<<endl;
	return 0;
}
a) 
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
b) 
Printing Using [] operator: 1 2 3 4 5 
Printing Using at() function: 1 2 3 4 5
c)

Printing Using [] operator: 1 2 3 4 5 
d) Printing Using at() function: 1 2 3 4 5
b
Output:
$ ./a.out 
Printing Using [] operator: 1 2 3 4 5 
Printing Using at() function: 1 2 3 4 5

c
15. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
#include <iostream>
#include <array>
using namespace std;
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	array<int,10> arr = {1,2,3,4,5};
	cout<<"size:"<<arr.size()<<endl;
	cout<<"maxsize:"<<arr.max_size()<<endl;
	return 0;
}
a) 
size:10
