This section on C++ questions and puzzles focuses on “Class Hierarchies Introduction”. One shall practice these questions and puzzles to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These programming puzzles can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C++ questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of C++ questions and puzzles on “Class Hierarchies Introduction” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:

a) The program executed
b) Error
c) Runtime error
d) program exceuted
b
6. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    class MyException    {        public:        MyException(int value) : mValue(value)        {        }        int mValue;    };    class MyDerivedException : public MyException    {        public:            MyDerivedException(int value, int anotherValue) : MyException(value),    mAnotherValue(anotherValue)            {            }            int mValue;            int mAnotherValue;    };    void doSomething()    {        throw MyDerivedException(10,20);    }    int main()    {        try        {            doSomething();        }        catch (MyDerivedException &exception)        {            cout << "\nCaught Derived Class Exception\n";        }        catch (MyException &exception)        {            cout << "\nCaught Base Class Exception\n";        }        return 0;    }
