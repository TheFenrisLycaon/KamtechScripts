This section on C++ interview questions and answers focuses on “Integer Types”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C++ interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of C++ interview questions on “Integer Types” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. The size_t integer type in C++ is?

d) Signed integer of at least 64 bits
c
2. What will be the output of the following C++ code?

a) 1
b) -1
c) 127
d) Implementation defined
d
5. Which of these expressions will make the rightmost set bit zero in an input integer x?
a) x = x | (x-1)
b) x = x & (x-1)
c) x = x | (x+1)
d) x = x & (x+2)
b
6. Which of these expressions will isolate the rightmost set bit?
a) x = x & (~x)
b) x = x ^ (~x)
c) x = x & (-x)
d) x = x ^ (-x)
c
