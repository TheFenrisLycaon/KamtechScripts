This section on C++ interview questions and answers focuses on “Standard Library Design”. One shall practice these interview questions to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C++ interview questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of C++ interview questions on “Standard Library Design” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:
1. Pick out the wrong header file about strings.
a) <string>
b) <regex>
c) <ios>
d) <reg>
c
2. Which is best for coding the standard library for c++?
a) no trailing underscores on names
b) complex objects are returned by value
c) have a member-swap()
d) all of the mentioned
d
-> No trailing underscores on names
-> Complex objects are returned by value
-> It should have a member-swap().

a
4. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    #include <vector>    using namespace std;    int main()    {        vector<int> v;        v.assign( 10, 42 );        for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++)         {            cout << v[i] << " ";        }    }
a) 42
b) 42 42
c) 424
d) 42 for 10 times
d
Output:
$ g++ std.cpp

a) ab
b) abc
c) a
d) error
b
Output:
$ g++ std1.cpp
$ a.out
abc
6. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <list>    #include <string>    #include <iostream>    using namespace std ;    typedef list<string> LISTSTR;     int main()    {        LISTSTR :: iterator i;        LISTSTR test;        test.insert(test.end(), "one");        test.insert(test.end(), "two");        LISTSTR test2(test);        LISTSTR test3(3, "three");        LISTSTR test4(++test3.begin(),        test3.end());        cout << "test:";        for (i =  test.begin(); i != test.end(); ++i)            cout << " " << *i << endl;        cout << "test:";        for (i =  test2.begin(); i != test2.end(); ++i)            cout << " " << *i << endl;        cout << "test:";        for (i =  test3.begin(); i != test3.end(); ++i)            cout << " " << *i << endl;        cout << "test:";        for (i =  test4.begin(); i != test4.end(); ++i)            cout << " " << *i << endl;    }
