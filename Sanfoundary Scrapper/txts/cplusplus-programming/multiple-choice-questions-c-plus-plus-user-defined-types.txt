This section on C++ MCQs (multiple choice questions) focuses on “User Defined Types”. One shall practice these MCQs to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walkin interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our multiple choice questions come with detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of C multiple choice questions on “User Defined Types” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions: 
1. Which keyword is used to define the user defined data types?
a) def
b) union
c) typedef
d) type
c
eg:
typedef int INT;
INT a;
here INT is used defined data type. 
2. Identify the correct statement.
a) typedef does not create different types. It only creates synonyms of existing types
b) typedef create different types
c) typedef create own types
d) typedef will not creates synonyms of existing types
a
3. What does the data type defined by union will do?
a) It allow one different portion of memory to be accessed as same data types
b) It allow one same portion of memory to be accessed as same data types
c) It allow one different portion of memory to be accessed as different data types
d) It allow one same portion of memory to be accessed as different data types
d
4. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    int main()    {        typedef int num;        num a = 10, b = 15;        num c = a + b + a - b;        cout << c;        return 0;    }
a) 20
b) 15
c) 30
d) 25
a
Output:
$ g++ user.cpp
$ a.out
20
5. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    int main()    {        int i;        enum month         {            JAN,FEB,MAR,APR,MAY,JUN,JUL,AUG,SEP,OCT,DEC        };        for (i = JAN; i <= DEC; i++)            cout << i;        return 0;    }
a) 012345678910
b) 0123456789
c) 01234567891011
d) 01234567891011122
a
Output:
$ g++ user1.cpp
$ a.out
012345678910
6. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    int main()    {        typedef int num;        typedef char let;        let w = "steve";        num a = 10, b = 15;        num c = a + w;        cout << c;        return 0;    }
a) 10steve
b) steve10
c) compile time error
d) compile but not run
c
7. What is the syntax of user-defined data types?
a) typedef ExistingDataType NameByUser
b) typedef NameByUser ExistingDataType
c) def NameByUser ExistingDataType
d) def NameByUser ExistingData
a
typedef int INT; (typedef existing-datatype New-name;). 
8. How many types of user-defined data type are in c++?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
c
9. What is the scope of typedef defined data types?
a) inside that block only
b) whole program
c) outside the program
