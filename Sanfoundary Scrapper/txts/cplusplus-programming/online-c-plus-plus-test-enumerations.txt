This section on online C++ test focuses on “Enumerations”. One shall practice these test questions to improve their C++ programming skills needed for various interviews (campus interviews, walk-in interviews, company interviews), placements, entrance exams and other competitive exams. These questions can be attempted by anyone focusing on learning C++ programming language. They can be a beginner, fresher, engineering graduate or an experienced IT professional. Our C online test questions come with the detailed explanation of the answers which helps in better understanding of C++ concepts.
Here is a listing of online C++ test questions on “Enumerations” along with answers, explanations and/or solutions:

c
2. In which type do the enumerators are stored by the compiler?
a) string
b) integer
c) float
d) string & float
b
3. To which of these enumerators can be assigned?

b) negative
c) enumerator
d) all of the mentioned
d
4. What will happen when defining the enumerated type?

a
5. Which variable does equals in size with enum variable?

a
6. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    enum  cat     {        temp = 7    };    int main()    {        int age = 14;        age /= temp;        cout << "If you were cat, you would be " << age << endl;        return 0;    }
a) If you were cat, you would be 5
b) If you were cat, you would be 2
c) If you were cat, you would be 7
d) If you were cat, you would be 9
b
$ g++ enum1.cpp
$ a.out
If you were cat, you would be 2

    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    enum test     {        A = 32, B, C    };    int main()    {        cout << A << B<< C;        return 0;    }
a) 323334
b) 323232
c) 323130
d) 323134
a
Output:
$ g++ enum2.cpp
$ a.out
323334
8. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    enum colour     {        green, red, blue, white, yellow, pink    };    int main()    {        cout << green<< red<< blue<< white<< yellow<< pink;        return 0;    }
a) 012345
b) 123456
c) compile time error
d) runtime error
a
Output:
$ g++ enum3.cpp
$ a.out
012345
9. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    using namespace std;    int main()    {        enum channel {star, sony, zee};        enum symbol {hash, star};        int i = 0;        for (i = star; i <= zee; i++)         {            printf("%d ", i);        }        return 0;    }
a) 012
b) 123
c) compile time error
d) runtime error
c
