1. RC5 encryption uses Right shift and decryption uses Left shift.
a) True
b) False
b
2. The below round is the last step in encryption /decryption in RC5.
a) True
b) False
b
3. The code bellow is the RC5 encryption pseudo code in C language.
What is the error?
LE0 = A + S[0];
RE0 = B + S [1];
for i = 1 to r    do
	LEi = ((LEi-1 ⊕ REi-1) >>> REi-1) + S [2xi];
	REi = ((REi-1 ⊕ LEi) <<< LEi) + S [2xi+1];
a) The left shift operation (should be right shift)
b) The right shift operation (should be left shift)
c) LEi-1  and REi-1 should be LEi and REi
d) The for loop runs from 1 to r-1 ( not 1 to r)
b
Correct code –
LE0 = A + S[0];
RE0 = B + S [1];
for i = 1 to r    do
	LEi = ((LEi-1 ⊕ REi-1) <<<REi-1) + S [2xi];
	REi = ((REi-1 ⊕ LEi) <<< LEi) + S [2xi+1];

4. “RC5 uses the Feistel Structure.”
a) True
b) False
b
5. Find the error in the Decryption pseudo code for RC5 –
for  i = 1  to  r    do
	RDi-1 = ((RDi  – S [2xi+1] >>> LDi ) ⊕ LDi);
	LDi-1 = ((LDi – S [2xi] >>> RDi-1) ⊕ RDi-1);
	B= RD0 + S [1];
	A = LD0 – S [0];
a) B= RD0 + S [1];
b) for  i = 1  to  r    do
c) LDi-1 = ((LDi – S [2xi] >>> RDi-1) ⊕ RDi-1);
d) A = LD0 – S [0];
a

Features seen in modern block ciphers are:
– Variable key length / block size / number of rounds
– Mixed operators, data/key dependent rotation
– Key dependent S-boxes
– More complex key scheduling
– Operation of full data in each round
– Varying non-linear functions.
