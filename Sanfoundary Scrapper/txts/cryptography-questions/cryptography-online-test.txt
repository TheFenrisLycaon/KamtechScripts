1. Find the ciphertext for the message {100110101011011} using superincreasing sequence { 1, 3, 5, 11, 35 } and private keys a = 5 and m=37.
a) C = ( 33, 47, 65 )
b) C = ( 65, 33, 47 )
c) C = ( 47, 33, 65 )
d) C = ( 47, 65, 33 )
c
a = 5		and m = 37
Public key generation:
{wi} = avi mod m
wi = {5, 15, 25, 18, 27}
Break the message into k-bit tuple i.e. 5-bit tuple
10011   01010 11011
Encoding of M as follows:
 M		Ci
10011		47
01010		33
11011		65
Ciphertext sent will be: C = (47, 33, and 65).
2. Suppose that plaintext message units are single letters in the usual 26-letter alphabet with A-Z corresponding to 0-25. You receive the sequence of ciphertext message units 14, 25, 89. The public key is the sequence {57, 14, 3, 24, 8} and the secret key is b = 23, m = 61.
Decipher the message. The Plain text is
a) TIN
b) INT
c) KIN
d) INK
b
Wi = {57, 14, 3, 24, 8}
b = 23    and m = 61
a = b-1 mod m
61 = 2 x23 + 15
23 = 1x 15 + 8		Therefore 1= 8 x 23 – 3 x 61
15 = 1x 8 + 7			b-1 = 23-1= 8
8 = 1x 7 + 1			a = 8
v_i=a^(-1) w_i mod m
=bw_i  mod m
v_i={ 30, 17, 8, 3, 1}
Cipher text	V = bC mod m	Plaintext
14	 23 x 14 mod 61 = 17 	01000 = 8 = I
25	 23 x 25 mod 61 = 26 	01101 = 13 = N
89	 23 x 89 mod 61 = 34	10011 = 19 = T.

a) 54
b) 43
c) 5
d) 24
c
                            C=Me mod n ;  C=517 mod 209 ; C = 80 mod 209.
