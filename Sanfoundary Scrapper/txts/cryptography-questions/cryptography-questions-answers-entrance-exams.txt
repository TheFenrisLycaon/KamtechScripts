5. The cipher block is one block longer than the plaintext to accommodate the IV.
a) True
b) False
a
6. The key Wrapping Algorithm provides confidentiality and data integrity.
a) True

a
7. Which of the following is a valid disadvantage of the PRNG based on MAC function?
a) It has a high throughput
b) It takes twice the execution time

8. “Specify in the correct order (from top to bottom), which Pseudo Random Number Generation schemes are represented here?
i)
m = [ n/outlen]
w_o = V
W = the null string
For i = 1 to m
w_i = MAC(K,w_i-1)
W = W || wi
Return leftmost n bits of W
ii)
m = [n/outlen]
W = the null string
For i = 1 to m
w_i = MAC(K,V || i)
W = W || w_i
Return leftmost n bits of W
iii)
m = [n/outlen]
A(0) = V
W = the null string
For I = 1 to m
A(i) = MAC (K,A(i-1))
w_i = MAC (K, a(I) || v)
W = W || w_i
Return leftmost n bits of W”
a) NIST SP 800-90 ; TLS/WTLS ; IEEE 802.11
b) TLS/WTLS ; NIST SP 800-90 ; IEEE 802.11
c) IEEE 802.11 ; NIST SP 800-90 ; TLS/WTLS
d) NIST SP 800-90 ; IEEE 802.11 ; TLS/WTLS
