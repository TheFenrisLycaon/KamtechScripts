6. Consider knapsack that weighs 23 that has been made from the weights of the superincreasing series {1, 2, 4, 9, 20, and 38}. Find the ‘n’.
a) 011111
b) 010011
c) 010111
d) 010010
b
		K=6,	V=23
Starting from largest number:
v5 > V	then				ϵ_5=0
v4 < V	then V = V – v4 = 23 – 20 = 3	ϵ_4=1
v3 > V	then				 ϵ_3=0
v2> V	then 				ϵ_2=0
v1 < V	then V = V – v1= 3 – 2 = 1	ϵ_1=1
v0 =1	then V = V – v0= 1 – 1 = 0	 ϵ_0=1
 		n= ϵ_5 ϵ_4 ϵ_3 ϵ_2 ϵ_1 ϵ_0 = 010011.
7. Another name for Merkle-Hellman Cryptosystem is
a) RC4
b) Knapsack
c) Rijndael
d) Diffie-Hellman
b
8. In Merkle-Hellman Cryptosystem, the hard knapsack becomes the private key and the easy knapsack becomes the public key.
a) True
b) False
b
9. In Merkle-Hellman Cryptosystem, the public key can be used to decrypt messages, but cannot be used to decrypt messages. The private key encrypts the messages.
a) True
b) False
b
10. The plaintext message consist of single letters with 5-bit numerical equivalents from (00000)2 to (11001)2. The secret deciphering key is the superincreasing 5-tuple (2, 3, 7, 15, 31), m = 61 and a = 17. Find the ciphertext for the message “WHY”.
a) C= (148, 143, 50)
b) C= (148, 143, 56)
c) C= (143, 148, 92)
d) C= (148, 132,92)
a
{wi} = { 17×2 mod 61, 17×3 mod 61, 17×7 mod 61, 17×15 mod 61, 17×31 mod 61}
{wi} = {34, 51, 58, 11, and 39}
PlainText  	 In binary   	 Ci
W- 22		10110		148
H – 7		00111		143
Y – 24		11000		50
So that the ciphertext sent will be C= (148, 143, 50).
11. For p = 11 and q = 17 and choose e=7. Apply RSA algorithm where PT message=88 and thus find the CT.
a) 23
b) 64
c) 11
d) 54
c
                            C=Me mod n ;  C=887 mod 187 ; C = 11 mod 187.
12. For p = 11 and q = 17 and choose e=7. Apply RSA algorithm where Cipher message=11 and thus find the plain text.
a) 88
b) 122
c) 143
d) 111
a
                            C=Me mod n ;  C=1123 mod 187 ; C = 88 mod 187.
13. In an RSA system the public key of a given user is e = 31, n = 3599. What  is the private key of this user?
a) 3031
b) 2412
c) 2432
d) 1023
a
Then, using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that the multiplicative
inverse of 31 modulo f(n) is 3031.
14. Compute private key (d, p, q) given public key (e=23, n=233 ´ 241=56,153).
a) 35212
b) 12543
c) 19367
d) 32432
c
f(n) = (p – 1)(q – 1) = 55,680
Using Extended Euclidean algorithm, we obtain
d = 23–1 mod 55680 = 19,367.
