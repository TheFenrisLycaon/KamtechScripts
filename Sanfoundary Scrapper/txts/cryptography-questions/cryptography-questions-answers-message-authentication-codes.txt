1. Which figure implements confidentiality and authentication?
a
 
2. Which figure implements confidentiality, authentication and signature?
d
3. The above figure implements authentication and signature only?
a) True
b) False
a
4. The above figure represents internal error control.
a) True
b) False
b
5. Another name for Message authentication codes is
a) cryptographic codebreak
b) cryptographic codesum
c) cryptographic checksum
d) cryptographic checkbreak
c
6. The following figure has authentication tied to the plaintext-
a) True
b) False
b
7. For a 150-bit message and a 10-bit MAC, how many values are the MAC value dependent on?
a) 2140
b) 2150
c) 215
d) 210
a
8. Confidentiality can only be provided if we perform message encryption before the MAC generation.
a) True
b) False
b
9. MACs are also called
a) testword
b) checkword
c) testbits
d) none of the mentioned
d
10. For a 100 bit key and a 32 bit tag, how many possible keys can be produced in the 3rd round?
a) 24
b) 232
c) 216
d) 264
a
Second round: 68 – 32 = 36.
Third round: 36 – 32 = 4.
Therefore 24 keys can be produced by the third round.

a) 2k
b) 2n
c) min(2k,2n)
d) 2k/2n
c
