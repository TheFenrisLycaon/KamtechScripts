1. In brute force attack, on average half of all possible keys must be tried to achieve success.
a) True
b) False
a

a) True
b) False
b
3. Divide (HAPPY)26 by (SAD)26. We get quotient –
a) KD
b) LD
c) JC
d) MC
a
4. Dividing (11001001) by (100111) gives remainder –
a) 11
b) 111
c) 101
d) 110
d
5. pi in terms of base 26 is
a) C.DRS
b) D.SQR
c) D.DRS
d) D.DSS
c
6. The time required to convert a k-bit integer to its representation in the base 10 in terms of big-O notation is
a) O(log2 n)
b) O(log n)
c) O(log2 2n)
d) O(2log n)
a
We have O(k) divisions, each requiring O(4k) operations (dividing a number with at most k bits 	by the 4 bit number (1010)). But O(4k) is the same as O(k) (constant factors don’t matter in the 	big-0 notation, so we conclude that the total number of bit operations is O(k). O(k) = 0(k2). If we 	want to express this in terms of n rather than k, then since k = O(1og n), we can write
Time(convert n to decimal) = 0(log2n).
7. In base 26, multiplication of YES by NO gives –
a) THWOE
b) MPAHT
c) MPJNS
d) THWAE
c

a) 1AD
b) DAD
c) BAD
d) 9AD
d
9. An encryption scheme is unconditionally secure if the ciphertext generated does not contain enough information to determine uniquely the corresponding plaintext, no matter how much cipher text is available.
