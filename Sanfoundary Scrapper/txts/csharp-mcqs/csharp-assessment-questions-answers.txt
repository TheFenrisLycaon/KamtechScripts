5. What will be the output of the following C# code snippet?
 class access {     public int x;     private int y;     public  void cal(int a, int b)     {         x = a + 1;         y = b;     } }     class Program {     static void Main(string[] args)     {         access obj = new access();            obj.cal(2, 3);         Console.WriteLine(obj.x + " " + obj.y);          } }
a) 3 3
b) 2 3
c) Run time error
d) Compile time error
d
6. What will be the output of the following C# code snippet?
class access{    public int x;    private int y;    public  void cal(int a, int b)    {        x = a + 1;        y = b;    }    public  void print()    {       Console.WriteLine(" " + y);        } }    class Program{    static void Main(string[] args)    {        access obj = new access();           obj.cal(2, 3);        Console.WriteLine(obj.x);        obj.print();        Console.ReadLine();    }}
a) 2 3
b) 3 3
c) Run time error
d) Compile time error
b
7. What will be the output of the following C# code snippet?
 class sum    {     public int x;     public int y;     public  int add (int a, int b)    {        x = a + b;        y = x + b;        return 0;    }}    class Program{    static void Main(string[] args)    {        sum obj1 = new sum();        sum obj2 = new sum();           int a = 2;        obj1.add(a, a + 1);        obj2.add(5, a);        Console.WriteLine(obj1.x + "  " + obj2.y);             Console.ReadLine();    }}
a) 6, 9
b) 5, 9
c) 9, 10
d) 3, 2
b
             So, a = 2, b = 3.
             x = 2 + 3 = 5.
             y = 5 + 3 = 8.
             Similarly, a = 5, b = a + 1 = 4.
             y = 5 + 4 = 9.
Output :
5, 9
8. What will be the output of the following C# code snippet?
class static_out{    public static int x;    public  static int y;    public int add(int a, int b)    {        x = a + b;        y = x + b;        return 0;    }}    class Program{    static void Main(string[] args)    {        static_out obj1 = new static_out();        static_out obj2 = new static_out();           int a = 2;        obj1.add(a, a + 1);        obj2.add(5, a);        Console.WriteLine(static_out.x + " " + static_out.y );             Console.ReadLine();    }}
a) 7 7
b) 6 6
c) 7 9
d) 9 7
c
Output :
 7, 9

c) both public & private
d) none of the mentioned
a
10. Which of the following statements are incorrect?

c
11. What will be the output of the following C# code snippet?
 class test {     public   int a;     public  int b;     public  test(int i, int j)     {         a = i;         b = j;     }     public void meth(test o)     {         o.a *= 2;         o.b /= 2;     } }     class Program {     static void Main(string[] args)     {         test obj = new test(10, 20);         obj.meth(obj);         Console.WriteLine(obj.a + " " + obj.b);             Console.ReadLine();     } }
a) 20, 40
b) 40, 20
c) 20, 10
