1. What will be the output of the following C# code?
static void Main(string[] args){    int i, j;    int[, ] arr = new int[ 3, 3];    for (i = 0; i < 3; ++i)    {        for (j = 0; j < 3; ++j)        {            arr[i, j] = i * 2 + i * 2;            Console.WriteLine(arr[i, j]);        }        Console.ReadLine();    }}
a) 0, 0, 0  4, 4, 4  8, 8, 8
b) 4, 4, 4  8, 8, 8   12, 12, 12
c) 8, 8, 8  12, 12, 12  16, 16, 16
d) 0, 0, 0  1, 1, 1  2, 2, 2
a
             for i = 0, j = 0, 0, 0, i = 1, j = 2, 2, 2.
Output:
0, 0, 0 4, 4, 4 8, 8, 8
2. What will be the output of the following C# code?
 static void Main(string[] args) {     char A = 'K';     char B = Convert.ToChar(76);     A++;     B++;     Console.WriteLine(A+ "  " +B);     Console.ReadLine(); }
a) M L
b) U L
c) L M
d) A B
c
Output:
L, M.
3. Complete the following C# code with “foreach condition”.
int[][]a = new int[2][];a[0] = new int[3]{3, 4, 2};a[1] = new int[2]{8, 5};foreach( int[]i in a){/* add for loop */console.write( j+ " ");console.writeline();}
a) foreach (int j = 1;(j(<)(a(0).GetUpperBound)); (j++));
b) foreach (int j = 1;(j(<)(a.GetUpperBound(0))); (j++));
c) foreach (int j in a.Length);
d) foreach (int j in i);
d
4. What will be the output of the following C# code?
static void Main(string[] args){    double a = 345.09;    byte c = (byte) a;    Console.WriteLine(c);    Console.ReadLine();}
a) 98
b) 89
c) 88
d) 84
b
Output :
89
5. Which statement is correct about following c#.NET code?
int[] a= {11, 3, 5, 9, 6};
a) ‘a’ is a reference to the array created on stack
b) ‘a’ is a reference to an object created on stack
c) ‘a’ is a reference to an object of a class that compiler drives from ‘System.Array’ class
d) None of the mentioned
c
6. What is the advantage of using 2D jagged array over 2D rectangular array?
a) Easy initialization of elements
b) Allows unlimited elements as well as rows which had ‘0’ or are empty in nature
c) All of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned
b
7. Which statement is correct about following C# code?
int[, ]a={{5, 4, 3},{9, 2, 6}};
a)’a’ represents 1-D array of 5 integers
b) a.GetUpperBound(0) gives 9
c)’a’ represents rectangular array of 2 columns and 3 arrays
d) a.GetUpperBound(0) gives 2
c
8. What will be the output of the following C# code?
static void Main(string[] args){    Program p = new Program();    p.display(2, 3, 8);    int []a = { 2, 56, 78, 66 };    Console.WriteLine("example of array");    Console.WriteLine("elements added are");    p.display(a);    Console.ReadLine();}public void display(params int[] b){    foreach (int i in b)    {        Console.WriteLine("ARRAY IS HAVING:{0}", i);    }}
a) Compile time error
b) Run time error
c) Code runs successfully but prints nothing
d) Code runs successfully and prints given on console
d
Output:
        ARRAY IS HAVING:2
        ARRAY IS HAVING:3
        ARRAY IS HAVING:8
        elements added are:
        ARRAY IS HAVING:2
        ARRAY IS HAVING:56
        ARRAY IS HAVING:78
        ARRAY IS HAVING:66
9. Which is the correct way of defining and initializing an array of 3 integers?
a) int[] a={78, 54};
b)
   int[] a;
   a = new int[3];
   a[1] = 78;
   a[2] = 9;
   a[3] = 54;
c)
   int[] a;
   a = new int{78, 9, 54};
d)
   int[] a;
   a = new int[3]{78, 9, 54};
d
10. Choose selective differences between an array in c# and array in other programming languages.
a) Declaring array in C# the square bracket([]) comes after the type but not after identifier
b) It is necessary to declare size of an array with its type
c) No difference between declaration of array in c# as well as in other programming languages
d) All of the mentioned
a
 example :
int[] IntegerArray;
ii. The size of the array is not part of its type as it is in the C language. This allows to declare an array and assign any array of int objects to it, regardless of the array’s length.
    int[] IntegerArray; 
    IntegerArray = new int[10]; 
    IntegerArray = new int[50];
