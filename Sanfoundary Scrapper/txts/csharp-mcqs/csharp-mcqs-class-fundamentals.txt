1. What will be the output of the following C# code?
 class sample {     public int i;     public int[] arr = new int[10];     public void fun(int i, int val)     {         arr[i] = val;     } } class Program {     static void Main(string[] args)     {         sample s = new sample();         s.i = 10;         sample.fun(1, 5);         s.fun(1, 5);         Console.ReadLine();     } }

a) 
10 20
5  25
b) 
20 10
25 5
c) 
10 20
5 125
