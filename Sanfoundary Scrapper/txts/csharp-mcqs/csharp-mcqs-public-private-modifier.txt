a
2. Which of these is used to access members of class before the object of that class is created?
a) public
b) private
c) static
d) protected
c
3. Which of these base classes are accessible to the derived class members?
a) static
b) protected
c) private
d) Shared
b
4. What is the process by which we can control parts of a program that can access the members of a class?

d) Recursion
c
5. What will be the output of the following C# code?
 class sum    {     public int x;     private int y;     public void math(int a, int b)     {         x = a * 4;         y = b;     } }     class Program {     static void Main(string[] args)     {         sum p = new sum();            p.math(12, 30);         Console.WriteLine(p.x + "  " + p.y);         Console.ReadLine();     } }
a) 48, 30
b) 48, 0
c) 0, 0
d) Compile time error
d
Output :
Change private y to public y
6. What will be the output of the following C# code?
 class sum    {     public int x;     public int y;     public  int add (int a,  int b)     {         x = a + b;         y = x + b;         return 0;     } }     class Program {     static void Main(string[] args)     {         sum obj1 = new sum();         sum obj2 = new sum();            int a = 2;         obj1.add(a,  a + 1);         obj2.add(5,  a);         Console.WriteLine(obj1.x + "  " + obj2.y);              Console.ReadLine();     } }
a) 6, 9
b) 5, 9
c) 9, 10
d) 3, 2
b
So, a = 2,  b = 3.
x = 2 + 3  = 5.
y = 5 + 3 = 8.
Similarly, a = 5,  b = a + 1 = 4.
y =  5 + 4 = 9.
Output :
5, 9
7. What will be the output of the following C# code?
 class math {     public int a,b;     public math(int i,  int j)     {         a = i;         b = j;     }     public  void sum(math m)     {         m.a *= 2;         m.b += 2;     } }     class Program {     static void Main(string[] args)     {         math t = new math(20,  10);         t.sum(t);         Console.WriteLine(t.a + "  " + t.b);            Console.ReadLine();     } }
a) 10, 20
b) 20, 10
c) 40, 12
d) 5, 40
c
Output :
 40, 12

d) public, private, protected, internal, protected internal
d
9. Choose the statements which are false in nature?

b) An object of a derived class cannot access private member of the base class
c) Private members of the base class cannot be accessed by derived class member functions or objects of derived class
d) None of the mentioned
a
10. Which of these access specifiers must be used for main() method?
a) private
b) public
c) protected
d) none of the mentioned
a
