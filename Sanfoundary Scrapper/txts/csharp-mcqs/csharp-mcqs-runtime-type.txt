1. Which mechanism among the following helps in identifying a type during the execution of a program?
a) Reflection
b) Runtime type ID
c) Both Reflection & Runtime type ID
d) None of the mentioned
b
2. Select the statement which are correct about RTTI(Runtime type identification)?
a) It allows the type of an object to be determined during program execution
b) It tells what type of object is being referred to by a base class reference determined by RTTI
c) Helps in prevention of an invalid cast exception in advance
d) All of the mentioned
d
3. Select the Keyword which supports the run time type identification?
a) is, as
b) as, typeof
c) Both is, as & as, typeof
d) Only is, as
c
4. What does the following C# code signify?
expr is type
a) Determines the type of an object
b) a simple deceleration
c) Both Determines the type of an object & a simple deceleration
d) None of the mentioned
a
5. What will be the output of the following C# code snippet?
class B { }class A : B { }class Program{    static void Main(string[] args)    {        A a = new A();        B b = new B();        if (a is A)         Console.WriteLine("a is an A");        if (b is A)        Console.WriteLine("b is an A because it is derived from A");        if (a is B)        Console.WriteLine("This won’t display -- a not derived from B");        Console.ReadLine();    }}
a) 
a is an A
This won’t display -- a not derived from B
b) 
a is an A
b is an A because it is derived from A
c) 
b is an A because it is derived from A
This won’t display -- a not derived from B
d) 
"Both ""a is an A
This won’t display — a not derived from B"" & ""a is an A
b is an A because it is derived from A"""
a
Output:
       a is an A
        This won’t display -- a not derived from B
  
6. Which operator among the following supports the operation of conversion at runtime without generating the exceptions?
a) is
b) as
c) typeof
d) all of the mentioned
b
7. Which operator among the following is used to perform the operation of boxing, unboxing, reference and identity conversions?
a) is
b) as
c) typeof
d) all of the mentioned
b
     expr as type
Here, expr is the expression being converted to type. If the conversion succeeds, then a reference to type is returned. Otherwise, a null reference is returned. The as operator can be used to perform only reference, boxing, unboxing, or identity conversions.
8. What will be the output of the following C# code snippet?
class A {}class B : A {}class CheckCast {    static void Main()     {        A a = new A();        B b = new B();        b = a as B;        b = null;        if(b==null)        Console.WriteLine("The cast in b = (B) a is NOT allowed.");        else        Console.WriteLine("The cast in b = (B) a is allowed");    }}
a) Run time error
b) The cast in b = (B) a is NOT allowed
c) The cast in b = (B) a is allowed
d) Compile time error
b
Output:
The cast in b = (B) a is NOT allowed
9. Which operator among the following supplies the information about the characteristics of a typeof?
a) is
b) as
c) typeof
d) none of the mentioned
c
10. What will be the output of the following C# code snippet?
class UseTypeof {    static void Main()     {        Type t = typeof(StreamReader);        Console.WriteLine(t.FullName);        if(t.IsClass) Console.WriteLine("Is a class.");        if(t.IsAbstract) Console.WriteLine("Is abstract.");        else Console.WriteLine("Is concrete.");    }}
a) 
Is a class
Is abstract
b) Is abstract
c) 
System.IO.StreamReader
Is a class
Is concrete
d) 
Both Is a class
Is abstract & System.IO.StreamReader
Is a class
Is concrete
c
Output:
         System.IO.StreamReader
         Is a class
         Is concrete
