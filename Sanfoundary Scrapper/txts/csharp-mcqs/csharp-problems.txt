1. Pointer variable is used to hold the _________ of the variable.
a) Value
b) Address
c) Value and Address
d) Name of the variable
b
2. Which among the given operators is referred to as ‘address of’ operator?
a) *
b) ^
c) &
d) ~
c
              For example,
                           int* ip;
                           int num = 10;
                           ip = &num;
puts into ip the memory address of the variable num. This address is the location of the variable in the computer’s internal memory.
3. Choose the correct statement among the given statements?
a) Use of return statement is necessary in every function
b) Return statement may not be followed by a parenthesis
c) A program may contain more than one return statement
d) Return statement may not return a value
a
4. What is the size of a char pointer?
a) 1 byte
b) 2 byte
c) 3 byte
d) 4 byte
b
             class UnsafeCode
             {
                 unsafe static void Main()
                 {
                  char ch;
                  Console.WriteLine(sizeof(char));
                  Console.ReadLine();
                 }
            }
The sizeof() method helps in calculating size of char pointer.

d
6. Which of the following job is done by the instruction ++*p for an integer pointer p?
a) increment value contained at address p
b) increment address contained in p
c) Both increment value contained at address p and increment address contained in p
d) neither increment value contained at address p nor increment address contained in p
a
             class UnsafeCode
             {
                 unsafe static void Main()
                 {
                      int n = 10;
                      int* p = &n;
                      Console.WriteLine(*p);

a) 6
b) print garbage value
c) print -6
d) print address of b + a
a
Output :
 4 + 2 = 6
8. What will be the output of the following C# code segment?
class UnsafeCode{    unsafe static void Main()    {         int n = 10;         void* p = &n;         Console.WriteLine(*p);         Console.ReadLine();     } }
a) The program will print 10

c
9. Which among the following is referred as an array of pointers?
a) int *p;
b) int (*)p;
c) int p[4];
d) int*[4] p;
d
10. Among the given pointer which of the following cannot be incremented?

a) program will print garbage value
b) program will print address of a
c) program will print value of a1
d) program will print address of a1
c
Output : 10
