1. In an experiment you have a U-Tube with two strains of bacteria in two arms. In one arm the bacteria are Gal+ and His-, in other the strain is Gal- and His+. If the two arms are joined by a membrane that doesn’t allow bacterial cells to pass to opposite site what will you observe when you plate each arm bacterial strain on minimal media?
a) None will grow
b) Some colonies seen in right arm
c) Some colonies seen in left arm
d) Some colonies seen in both arms
d

8. If the probability of incorporation of a gene A from a bacterial cell that has lysed in the medium is a. And the probability of incorporation of another gene B from the same bacteria that has lysed is b. What is the probability of one recipient receiving both?
a) a+b
b) a-b
c) a X b
