b) F’ and F-
c) HFR and F-
d) HFR and F+
d
2. In an experiment you have met, bio, thr+ and leu + bacterial strain in test tube 1; and met+, bio+, thr and leu bacterial strain in other test tube 2. Which of the following will not comply with your experimental results?
a) Both the strains will grow in enriched media
b) 2nd strain will grow in met absent media
c) Mixture of two strains will grow in minimal media
d) 1st stain will not grow in leu absent media
d
3. In case of mixing his+ leu- strain with his- leu+ strain we can see that the auxotroph behaves as prototroph for these two genes. This is because of________________
a) One is synthesizing one amino acid and giving it to the other type
b) They fuse to form similar diploid bacteria
c) Both will have the same genetic composition at the end
d) They share the RNA by extracellular processes
c
4. Which gene in a plasmid is indispensible for it to participate in conjugation?
a) Pilli forming gene
b) Origin of replication
c) Sex determining gene
d) Origin of transfer
c
5. Which of the following can transfer the genes in bacterial nucleoid as well?
a) F- plasmid
b) R factor
c) F’ plasmid
d) HFR
d
6. A HFR bacteria mates with an F- plasmid containing bacteria. What will be the type of bacteria after conjugation is complete?
a) F+
b) F-
c) F’
d) HFR
b
7. All the genes in the HFR that is transferred to the recipient cell before breakage of the conjugation channel is incorporated in the recipient genome. State whether it is true or false.
a) True
b) False
b
8. In and interrupted mating experiment, it is seem that the after 10 mins AziR gene in recipient, after 20 minuites there is appearance of tonR  and after 15 mins the recipient is lac+ , but the recipient is almost never his+.  Where in the genome is the ori of transfer?
a) Between AziR and TonR genes
b) Between TonR and Lac+
c) Between Lac+ and His+
d) Between His+ and AziR
d
9. If genes enter the different F- cells from different HFRs in the order as shown-
	 Azi   	8	88
	Ton	10	90
	Lac	17	3
	Gal	24	11
What is the order of the gene where columns are for different HFR and values denote time?
a) Azi, Lac, Gal, Ton
b) Lac, Gal, Azi, Ton
c) Gal, Lac, Ton, Azi
d) Tob, Azi, Lac, Gal
b
10. In an experiment of determining the order of gene in bacteria we use HFR which is gal+, Lac+, Ara+ and His+. If the recipient is negative for all these genes, and we selectively choose Gal + and get the pattern-
100 % recipients are Gal +
30% are His+
55% are Lac +
And only 5% are Ara+
What would be our inference?
a) Sequence of gene is Gal—Lac—His—Ara
b) As we are just selecting one gene we can’t tell the sequence
c) The HFR was incorporated between Gal and His only
d) The recipient selectively incorporated some genes
a
11. For complete HFR to enter the recipient, how much time should the two bacterial cells be in contact?
a) 10 mins
b) 30 mins
c) 60 mins
d) 100 mins
d
12. You study the gene incorporation in recipient using HFR and get the following sequences-
P-W-A-K, W-L-I-K, A-K-I-L, W-P-R-T-W-L. What is the order of the gene?
a) P-W-A-K-W-T-R-L-I
b) W-P-R-T-W-L-A-K-I
c) A-K-I-L-W-T-R-P-W
D) W-A-K-I-L-P-R-T-W
