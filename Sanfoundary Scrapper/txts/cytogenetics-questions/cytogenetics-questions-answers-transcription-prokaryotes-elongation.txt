1. While studying the transcripts in vitro you observe that other than the longer transcripts there are some short stretches of RNA oligomer produced as well. You repeat the experiment several times but these oligomers seem to persist. What is the possible explanation?
a) Procedural error
b) They are the un-ligated oligomers of lagging strand
c) Experimental artifact
d) Normal occurrence
c
2. Capping of RNA is necessary as_______
a) It helps us distinguish 5’ from 3’ end
b) It has a rolling action and condenses the transcript as it is produced
c) To protect the transcript from exonuclease
d) To prevent the transcript from sticking to DNA
c
3. What is the 1st nucleotide of a completely synthesized transcript?
a) A
b) G

b
6. You design a reconstructive RNA polymerase where you take the beta and alpha subunit from a rifampicin resistant strain and beta prime and sigma subunit from rifampicin sensitive strain. You check the rate of transcription by this RNA polymerase after the addition of the antibiotic. What will be your observation?

c) Normal transcription
d) Improved transcription
c
7. You add labeled Uridine analogue to the mixture of DNA and RNA pol in vitro. What are you trying to determine?
