c) Radiation
d) Filtration
a
8. “The spoon is rinsed in running cold water. Heat gets absorbed by the water and the spoon gets cooler, until the spoon and the water are at the same temperature” is an example of which of the following way of heat transfer?

b) Solar heating
c) Heating with gamma rays
d) Oxidation
a
11. Heat exchanger works on which of the following principle?

b) Indirect heating
c) Slow heating
d) Fast heating
b
12. If the product flow rate in a plant is to be increased from 10 000 l/h to 20 000 l/h, the heat exchanger must be extended to_______ the original size, provided the flow rates of the service media are also doubled, other factors being constant.

d) Quadruple
a
13. Calculate temperature change: 20 000 l/h cheese milk (V1) is to be heated from 4°C to 34°C by 30 000 l/h hot water (V2) at 50°C. Density (r) and specific heat (cp) for milk are about 1020 kg/m3 and 3.95 kJ/kg, K and for water 990 (at 50°C) and 4.18.
a) 20.5℃
b) 21.5℃
c) 18.8℃
d) 19.5℃
d
                    	20 000 x 1 020 x 3.95 x (34 – 4) = 30 000 x 990 x 4.18 x Dt2
Dt2 = 19.5°C. The hot water temperature will drop by 19.5 from 50 to 30.5°C.
14. The temperature difference between the two liquids is best utilized if they flow in opposite directions through the heat exchanger. This type of flow is called ________

b) Concurrent
c) Rapid flow
d) Slow flow
a
15. ______________ tells how much heat passes through 1 m2 of the partition per 1°C of differential temperature.
a) Friction coefficient
b) Temperature coefficient
c) Overall heat transfer coefficient
d) Time coefficient
c
