8. What are the reasons causing pressure drop in hydraulic systems?
i. Long length of pipe
ii. Friction
iii. Type of fluid

9. Calculate area of a pipe if, flow rate is 20 l/min and flow velocity is 5 cm/s.
a) 66.66 cm2
b) 60 cm2
c) 62 cm2
d) 64 cm2
a
      = 200000 cm3/60s
     = 333.33 cm3/s
   Flow Rate = Velocity x Area
   333.33cm3/s = 5cm/s x Area
   Area = 333.33cm3/s / 5 cm/s
   = 66.66 cm2.
