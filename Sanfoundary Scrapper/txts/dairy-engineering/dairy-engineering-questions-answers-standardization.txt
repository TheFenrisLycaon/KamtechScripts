1. Standardization of milk involved which of the following?
a) Adjustment of fat content
b) Breakdown of protein
c) Whitish appearance of milk
d) Increase in nutritional content of milk
a
2. Which of the following method is used in a standardization of milk?
a) Pearson square method
b) Donald method
c) Jake method
d) Pearson cube method
a
3. The pressure in the skim milk outlet must be kept _______ in order to enable accurate standardization.
a) High
b) Low
c) Constant
d) Steep
c
4. Which of the factor does not affect the precision in standardization process?
a) Fluctuations in the fat content of the incoming milk
b) Fluctuations in throughput
c) Fluctuations in preheating temperature
d) Fluctuation in protein content
d
5. The cream fat content is _______ to the flow rate.
a) Inversely proportional
b) Directly proportional
c) Neither inversely proportional nor directly proportional
d) Increased
a
6. What is the objective of Bactofugation?
a) Separate microorganisms from milk
b) Separate fat from skim milk
c) Standardize milk
d) Separate fat globules
a
7. Which of the following device is used in Bactofugation?
a) Decanter
b) Centrifuge
c) Bactofuge
d) Filter
a
8. Major Application of Bactofugation is in which of the following processing?
a) Wine processing
b) Juice processing
c) Cheese processing
d) Ice cream processing
c
9. The amount of bactofugate from the two-phase Bactofuge ______ as compared to one-phase Bactofuge.
a) More
b) Less
c) Constant
d) Variable
a
10. A decanter centrifuge is a machine for continuous sedimentation of suspended solids from a liquid by the action of ________in an elongated, horizontal rotating bowl.
a) Centrifugal force
b) Gravitation force
c) Friction force
d) Force of resistance
a
11. How much whole milk with 3.9% fat and skimmed milk with 0.04% fat content will you need to produce 2000 kg of standardized milk with 2.5% fat?
a) 725.4 kg
b) 825.4 kg
c) 925.4 kg
d) 715.4 g
a
 Proportion of the whole milk = 2.46/3.86
Amount of whole milk required = (2.46/3.86)*2000 = 1274.6 kg
Proportion of skimmed milk = 1.4/3.86
Amount of skimmed milk required = (1.4/3.86)*2000 = 725.4 kg (or 2000 – 1274.6).
12. 500 kg of milk testing 6.5% fat to be standardized to 3.1% fat using skim milk containing 0.05% fat. Therefore, the quantity of skim milk required to be added to 500 kg whole milk will be?
a) 557.38 kg
b) 440 kg
c) 850 kg
d) 500 kg
a
Thus mixing of 3.05 kg of 6.5% fat milk with 3.40 kg of the skim milk will yield 6.45 kg of milk containing the desired fat level i.e. 3.1%. Therefore, the quantity of skim milk required to be added to 500 kg whole milk will be (3.4 x 500)/3.05=3.05. Accordingly, 557.38 kg of 0.05% skim milk mixed with 500 kg of 6.5% fat whole milk will yield 1057.38 kg of milk having 3.1% fat.
13. Which of the following standardization is more desirable in large-scale operation?
a) Continuous
b) Batch
c) No standardization
d) Centrifugation
a
14. How many parts by weight of 40% cream and 3% milk must be mixed to make milk testing 5% fat?
a) 2 and 35
b) 4 and 45
c) 5 and 10
d) 6 and 12
a
15. Fat is added back to skim milk in the process of standardization.
a) True
b) False
a
