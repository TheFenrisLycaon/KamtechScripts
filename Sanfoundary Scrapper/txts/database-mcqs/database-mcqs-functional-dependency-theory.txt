instructor (ID, name, dept name, salary)
department (dept name, building, budget)
This comes under
a) Lossy-join decomposition
b) Lossy decomposition
c) Lossless-join decomposition
d) Both Lossy and Lossy-join decomposition
d
5. There are two functional dependencies with the same set of attributes on the left side of the arrow:
A->BC
A->B
This can be combined as
a) A->BC
b) A->B
c) B->C
d) None of the mentioned
a
6. Consider a relation R(A,B,C,D,E) with the following functional dependencies:
ABC -> DE and
D -> AB
The number of superkeys of R is:
a) 2
b) 7
c) 10
d) 12
c
7. Suppose we wish to find the ID’s of the employees that are managed by people who are managed by the employee with ID 123. Here are two possible queries:
I.SELECT ee.empID
  FROM Emps ee, Emps ff
  WHERE ee.mgrID = ff.empID AND ff.mgrID = 123;
II.SELECT empID
  FROM Emps 
  WHERE mgrID IN
  (SELECT empID FROM Emps WHERE mgrID = 123);
Which, if any, of the two queries above will correctly (in SQL2) get the desired set of employee ID’s?
a) Both I and II
b) I only
c) II only
d) Neither I nor I
a
8. Suppose relation R(A,B) currently has tuples {(1,2), (1,3), (3,4)} and relation S(B,C) currently has {(2,5), (4,6), (7,8)}. Then the number of tuples in the result of the SQL query:
<i>SELECT *
	FROM R NATURAL OUTER JOIN S; </i>IS:
a) 2
b) 4
c) 6
d) None of the mentioned
a
9. Suppose now that R(A,B) and S(A,B) are two relations with r and s tuples, respectively (again, not necessarily distinct). If m is the number of (not necessarily distinct) tuples in the result of the SQL query:
	R intersect S;
Then which of the following is the most restrictive, correct condition on the value of m?
a)	m = min(r,s)
b)	0 <= m <= r + s
c)	min(r,s) <= m <= max(r,s)
d)	0 <= m <= min(r,s)
d
10. Suppose relation R(A,B,C,D,E) has the following functional dependencies:
A -> B
B -> C
BC -> A
A -> D
E -> A
D -> E
Which of the following is not a key?
a) A
b) E
c) B, C
d) D
c
