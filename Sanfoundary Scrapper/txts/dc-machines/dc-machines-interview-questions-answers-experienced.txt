1. To achieve spark less commutation brushes of a DC generator are placed ________
a) just ahead of magnetic neutral axis
b) in magnetic neutral axis
c) just behind the magnetic neutral axis
d) can be placed anywhere
a
2. If in the DC machine, the reversal of current in the coil is faster than ideal or linear commutation then the commutation is said to be __________ commutation.
a) Retarded
b) Curvilinear
c) Accelerated
d) Under
c
3. For a DC machine, in a commutator ________
a) Copper is harder than mica
b) Mica and copper are equally hard
c) Mica is harder than copper
d) Cannot be determined
c
4. The insulating material used between the commutator segments is normally _______
a) Graphite
b) Paper
c) Air gap
d) Mica
d
Explanations: Each conducting segment of the commutator is insulated from adjacent segments. Mica is a good electric insulator and good thermal conductor as well. Its applications in electric fields are derived from its unique mechanical properties. Thus, it allows mica to be ductile enough for its appropriate space of application.
5. Why interpoles are tapered in a DC machine?
a) Simpler design
b) Reduction in the weight
c) Increase in acceleration of commutation
d) Cannot be determined
c
6. The main function of interpoles in a loaded DC machine is to minimize _______between the brushes and the commutator.
a) Friction
b) Sparking
c) Current
d) Wear and tear
b
7. Which of the following is different component?
a) Commutating poles
b) Compoles
c) Interpoles
d) Compensating winding
d
8. How many coils under an adjoining pole pairs is/are connected between adjacent commutator segments in lap winding?
a) 1/2
b) 2
c) 1
d) 1/4
c
9. In wave winding, P/2 coils are connected under the influence of “x” pole-pairs which connect adjacent segments. X is ____
a) P
b) P/2
c) 2P
d) P/4
b
10. The process of current reversal takes place when the coil is passing through the interpolar region.
a) True
b) False
a
11. How many coil sets undergo commutation simultaneously in a wave winding?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 4
d) 3
b
12. Which coil is shorted in commutation process?
a) Coil under north pole
b) Coil under south pole
c) Coil lying in an interpolar region
d) Cannot be determined
c
13. Ideal commutation can be shown graphically by _____________
a) Straight line passing through origin
b) Straight line not passing through origin but with +ve slope
c) Straight line not passing through origin but with -ve slope
d) Curve increasing towards +ve t axis
c
