1. Which of the following is the best braking method?
a) Friction
b) Electromechanical action
c) Eddy-currents
d) Electric braking
d
2. DC motor is still widely used in tractions due to its excellent braking properties.
a) True
b) False
b
3. Which of the following is not the method of electrical braking?
a) Plugging or counter-current
b) Dynamic or rheostatic
c) Regenerative
d) Eddy current
d
4. Which of the following is the plugging method of braking?
a) Reversal of field connections
b) Reversal of armature connections
c) Addition of equal and opposite field
d) Removal of field circuit from current machine circuit
b
5. Which of the following is correct formula for braking torque in plugging?
a) n (ka2/Rb)
b) n2 (ka2/Rb)
c) n-1 (ka2/Rb)
d) (ka2/Rb)
a
 T= [(nka )2/Rb]/n. As, Braking power is equal to Ea2/Rb/n. By solving for the braking torque from the above equation, we get n (ka2/Rb).
6. Electrical braking of any variety becomes less effective as ________________
a) Speed increases
b) Speed decreases
c) Independent of speed
d) Depends on supply voltage
b
7. Plugging is applied in a motor, if we don’t make the switch OFF what will happen?
a) Motor will come to rest as a result of plugging
b) Motor will come to rest and will start rotating in another direction
c) Motor will burn
d) Nothing will happen
b
8. Plugging is used in ____________
a) Small motors only
b) Small and medium powered
c) Only in large heavy machines
d) Everywhere
a
9. Which of the following is dynamic braking?
a) Reversal of field connections
b) Reversal of armature connections
c) Addition of equal and opposite field
d) Removal of armature circuit from current machine circuit
d
10. Braking time in the dynamic braking is the function of _____________
a) System inertia
b) Load torque
c) Motor rating
d) All- system inertia, load torque and motor rating
d
11. In dynamic braking, when braking is applied system acts as ___________
a) Freely running machine
b) Motor with slow speed
c) Generator
d) Motor with same speed in opposite direction
c
12. In which of the following electrical braking method, energy is supplied back to the supply?
a) Plugging
b) Dynamic braking
c) Regenerative braking
d) In all electrical braking
c
