a) 2[Bi(av)liva] Nc = Lc (dic/dt) = Lc (2lc/tc)
b) [Bi(av)liva] Nc = Lc (dic/dt) = Lc (2lc/tc)

d) Cannot be determined
a
With Bi determined by above equation, the ampere-turns needed to cancel the armature reaction ampere-turns and then to create the necessary flux density are given by, ATi = ATa (peak)+(Bi/µ0 )lgi 
12. For a given 4-pole machine, carrying armature current 56.82 A, with 846 conductors. The mean flux density in the air gap under the interpoles is 0.5 Wb/m2 on full load and radial gap length is 0.3 cm. Ampere-turns required for an interpole is ____________
a) 3198
b) 2099
c) 4198
d) 6297
c
 ATi =[(56.82*846)/ (2*2*4 )] +(0.5/4π*10-7 )* 0.3*10-2 =4198. Turns can be found by dividing with armature current.
13. A 440 V, 4-pole, 25 kW, dc generator has a wave-connected armature winding with 846 conductors. The mean flux density in the air-gap under the interpoles is 0.5 Wb/m2 on full load and the radial gap length is 0.3 cm. Number of turns required on each interpole is _________
a) 74
b) 84
c) 64
d) 54
a
 ATi = ATa (peak) +(Bi/µ0) lgi.
= Ia* Z/2*A*P + (Bi/µ0) lgi.
Assuming Ia = Iline Ia = 25*103/440= 56.82 A.
ATi = [(56.82*846)/ (2*2*4)] +(0.5/4π*10-7 )* 0.3*10-2 =4198.
Ni= 4198/56.82= 74.
