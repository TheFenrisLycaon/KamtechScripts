6. What is the average coil emf generated in a 4-pole DC machine having flux/pole equal to 0.1 wb rotating at 1500 rpm? (No. of coil sides = 100)
a) 19 kV
b) 1.9 kV
c) 190 V
d) 19 V
a
E= 0.1*1500*100*4/3.14
E= 60000/3.14
E≅ 19 Kv.

a) Armature speed and armature emf
b) Armature emf and armature speed
c) Armature current and armature emf
d) Armature speed and armature current
d
8. What is the value of Np in an average coil emf equation, for 10 armature conductors with 2 parallel paths?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 2.5
d) 4
c
9.What is the torque equation in terms of B, Ic, l, Zr (r= mean air gap radius)?
a) Bav*Ic*l*Zr
b) Bav*Ic*l/Zr
c) Bav*Ic*Zr/l
d) Can’t be expressed
a
T developed= Bav*Ic*l*Zr  (Here, r= mean air gap radius).
10. What is the value of pole pitch (in SI unit) for mean air gap radius= 0.5mm and P=4?
a) 0.785* 10-6
b) 0.785* 10-3
