6. To counter the effect of shift in MNA due to armature reaction, which of the following component can be shifted?
a) Poles
b) Commutator
c) Brushes
d) Cannot be determined
c
7. Calculate the number of conductors on each pole piece required in a compensating winding for a 6-pole lap-wound dc armature containing 286 conductors. The compensating winding carries full armature current. Assume ratio of pole arc/ pole pitch = 0.7.
a) 6
b) 8
c) 9
d) 7
a
Ncw/pole = (Z/2AP) * (pole arc/pole pitch) = [286 / (2*6*6)] 0.7 = 2.78.
Compensating conductors/pole = 2 * 2.78 = 6 (nearest integer). 
8. A compensating winding with ampere-turns greater than peak ampere turns is required in order to neutralize the effect of armature reaction because _____________
a) Pole arc = Pole pitch
b) Pole arc > Pole pitch
c) Pole arc < Pole pitch
d) Can’t be determined using pole arc, pole pitch
b
9. If pole arc is less than pole pitch, a compensating winding will have ampere-turns _________ (compare to peak ampere turns).
a) Less
b) Equal
c) More
d) Can’t be specified
a
10. What is the pole arc/pitch ratio, if 360 AT compensating winding is used where 1960AT is peak value?
a) 0.7
b) 0.8
c) 0.9
d) 0.6
d
11. Only drawback of compensating winding is _______
a) Cost
b) Unavailability of material
c) Construction
d) Not a single drawback
a
