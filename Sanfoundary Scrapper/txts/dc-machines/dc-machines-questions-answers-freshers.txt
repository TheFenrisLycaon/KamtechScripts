1. A 4-pole Dc wound machine is lap wound with 400 conductors. The pole shore is 20 cm long and average flux density over one-pole pitch is 0.4 T, the armature diameter being 30 cm. What is the value of flux/pole?
a) 0.188 Wb
b) 18.88 Wb
c) 0.0188 Wb
d) 1.888 Wb
c
2. A 4-pole Dc wound machine is lap wound with 400 conductors. The pole shore is 20 cm long and average flux density over one-pole pitch is 0.4 T, the armature diameter being 30 cm. What is the value of induced emf?
a) 188 V
b) 276 V
c) 94 V
d) 188 mV
a
3. Coil torque for 20 kA armature current (T1) and 40 mA armature current (T2), will have ratio T1/T2=____ (assuming all other parameters same for both machines).
a) 1/2
b) 2/1
c) 1/4
d) 4/1
a
4. If the no load speed of DC motor is 1300 rpm and full load speed is 1100 rpm, then its voltage regulation is ____________
a. 12.56%
b. 18.18 %
c. 17.39%
d. 18.39%
b
5.  If the average coil emf of a DC motor is doubled and flux is halved (keeping other parameters constant) then its shaft speed will become ___________
a. Twice of the original speed
b. Square of the original speed
c. Four times of the original speed
d. Half of the original speed
c
From the emf equation we get speed of the shaft i.e. n α E/Z, when all other parameters are kept constant. So, when E is doubled n becomes twice the original, halving flux on reduced emf will quadrupled the speed of a DC machine.
6. A 4-pole wave wound DC motor drawing an armature current of 20 A has provided with 360 armature conductors. If the flux per pole is 0.015 Wb then the torque developed by the armature of motor is _______
a. 10.23 N-m
b. 34.37 N-m
c. 17.17 N-m
d. 19.08 N-m
b
7. In a DC machine, what is the torque induced beyond the pole shoes?
a) 0
b) 2/π *∅*i
c) π *∅*i/2
d) Can’t be calculated
a
8. For a constant emf, if field current is reduced then the speed of the DC motor will_____
a) Remains same
b) Increases
c) Decreases
d) Can’t say
b
9. For an ideal DC machine, which phenomenon will reduce the terminal voltage?
a) Armature reaction
