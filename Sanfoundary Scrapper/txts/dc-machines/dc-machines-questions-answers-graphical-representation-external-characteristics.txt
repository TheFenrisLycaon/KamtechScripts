1. No load point of DC generator is __________
a) Intersection of OCC and Rf line
b) Point on the Y axis at rated field current
c) Point on the X axis at rated terminal voltage
d) Can’t find through graphical interpretation
a
2. Rf line intersects with OCC in ________
a) 1st quadrant
b) 2nd quadrant
c) 3rd quadrant
d) 4th quadrant
a
3. How armature resistance effect is shown graphically?
a) By adding IaRa product horizontally with Rf line
b) By subtracting IaRa product vertically with Rf line
c) By adding  IaRa product vertically with Rf line
d) By subtracting  IaRa product horizontally with Rf line
c
4. For determining IaRa maximum _____________
a) Distance between Rf line and v+ IaRa line is taken
b) Distance between OCC and v+ IaRa line is taken
c) Maximum Distance between OCC and v+ IaRa line is taken
d) Can’t calculated graphically
c
5. How demagnetization effect of armature reaction is shown graphically?
a) By shifting origin towards +ve y axis
b) By shifting origin towards +ve x axis
c) By shifting origin towards -ve y axis
d) By shifting origin towards -ve x axis
d
6. External characteristics of DC shunt motor lies in ______________
a) 1st quadrant
b) 2nd quadrant
c) 1st and 2nd quadrant
d) 4th quadrant
c
7. From magnetization characteristic at If = 7.1 A, Ea = 225 V at 1000 rpm. What will be the terminal voltage at speed 950 rpm?
a) 225 V
b) 235 V
c) 214 V
d) 220 V
c
Ea (950 rpm) = 225 x 950 / 1000, this will give speed of given DC machine at 950 rpm. Upon calculations we get, Ea = 213.7 V= 214 V approx.
8. For a given compound DC machine, Net field current obtained from characteristic is equal to 7.5 A, where shunt field current is equal to 5 A, armature current is 505 A, demagnetizing current equal to 0.95 A and shunt field winding of 1000 turns at rated speed of 1000 rpm. What will be the series field turns?
a) 7
b) 8
c) 5
d) 9
a
5 + 505(Nse /1000) – 0.95 = If (net).
Calculating for Nse by substituting If (net), we get Nse = 6.8 that is 7 turns.
