1. Resultant pitch in the lap winding is__________
a) Depends on Yb value
b) Depends on Yf value
c) Depends on Yb and Yf value
d) Always equal to 2
d
2. What is the condition of retrogressive winding?
a) Yb > Yf
b) Yb < Yf
c) Yb = Yf
d) No condition in bterms of Yb and Yf
b
3. What is the value of Yb for a lap winding with a 4-pole, 12-slot armature with two coil sides/slot. Assume single-turns coils.
a) 3
b) 5
c) 7
d) 9
c
YCS= 12/4= 3.
Yb = 2YCS +1= 7.
4. What is the value of Yf for a lap winding with a 4-pole, 12-slot armature with two coil sides/slot? (Assume single-turns coils – progressive winding)
a) 3
b) 5
c) 7
d) 9
b
YCS= 12/4= 3.
Yb = 2YCS +1= 7
Yf =Yb – 2= 7-2= 5.
5. Equalizer rings are needed in lap winding.
a) False
b) True
b
6. What is the symmetry requirement of lap winding?
a) 2C/P= 0
b) 2C/P= integer
c) 2C/P= non-integer

a) A = P
b) A < P
c) A > P
d) No relation exists
a
8. Current flowing through the armature conductors Ic is related to total current Ia by_______
a) Ic = A Ia
b) Ic = Ia/A
c) Ic = A2 Ia
d) Ic = A/Ia
b
9. Value of commutator pitch in lap winding is_____
a) +2
b) +1 or -1
c) -2
d) Different for different parameters
b
For progressive winding, commutator pitch = +1. For retrogressive winding, commutator pitch = -1.
10. What is the value of Yf for a lap winding with a 4-pole, 12 commutator segments, with two coil sides/slot.?
(Assume single-turns coils -retrogressive winding).
a) 9
b) 3
c) 11
d) 5
a
YCS= 12/4= 3.
Yb = 2YCS +1= 7
Yf =Yb + 2= 7+2= 9.
