a
9. How short shunt and long shunt compound winding is selected?
a) Mechanical considerations
b) Switch reversal
c) Performance
d) Mechanical considerations and switch reversal
d
10. If a DC compound machine connected as a motor is about to use as a generator, we reverse the series field connections.
a) True
b) False
a
11. For a long-shunt compound motoring, which of the following equation is correct?
a) Vt= Ea+ Ia(Ra+ Rse)
b) Vt= Ea– Ia(Ra+ Rse)
c) Vt= Ea+ Ia(Ra– Rse)
d) Vt= -Ea+ Ia(Ra+ Rse)
a
12. Vt= Ea– Ia(Ra+ Rse) is the equation for _______________
a) Short shunt compound motoring mode
b) Short shunt compound generating mode
c) long shunt compound motoring mode
d) Cannot be determined
b
13. How shunt field is controlled?
a) Diverter resistor in parallel
b) Tapped field winding
c) Series regulating resistance
d) Other methods
c
Control of Excitation: 1) Shunt field: by a series regulating resistance.2) Series field: For small armature by a diverter resistance connected in parallel with series field. For large armature by tapped field winding so the winding turns can be changed.
14. The generator is called flat compounded if _____________
a) The series field ampere turns are such as to produce the same voltage at rated load as at no load
b) The series field turns are such as that the no load voltage is smaller than the rated load voltage
c) The rated voltage is less than the no load voltage
d) Cannot be determined
