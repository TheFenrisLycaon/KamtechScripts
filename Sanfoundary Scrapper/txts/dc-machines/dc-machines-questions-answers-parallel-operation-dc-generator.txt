1. For connecting two generators in parallel, they should have __________________
a) Same current rating
b) Same ohmic rating
c) Same voltage rating
d) All ratings must be same
c
2. While connecting two DC generators in parallel, which of the following is not a desirable condition?
a) Same voltage rating
b) Same percentage voltage regulation
c) Same percentage speed regulation of the prime movers
d) Same current rating
d
3. We connect two generators in parallel _____________
a) For large DC load
b) For small DC load
c) For any DC load
d) For any AC or DC load
Answer: We connect two generators in parallel for supplying large DC load. It is desirable to use more than one generator in parallel. This arrangement provides the security that if one generator gives way, the other(s) can feed part load. 
4. Load sharing of two generators connected in parallel is determined by __________
a) Internal characteristics
b) External characteristics
c) Both internal and external characteristics
d) It doesn’t depend on load sharing
b
5. For a parallel operation of 2 DC shunt generators, we get net external characteristics ___________
a) Starting from the same no-load point and between generator 1 and generator 2
b) Starting from the same no-load point and below generator 1 and generator 2
c) Starting from the same no-load point and above generator 1 and generator 2
d) Can’t be determined
c
6. When two compound generators are connected in parallel, when load current in generator 1 is increased __________
a) Both generator will share same load
b) Generator 1 will start running as motor
c) Generator 2 will be overloaded
d) Generator 2 will start running as motor
d
7. While running two compound motors in parallel, we connect equalizer ring between ___________
a) Two armatures
b) Two fields
c) Two load points
d) Anywhere
a
8. When two DC series motors are connected in parallel, the resultant speed is __________
a) More than the normal speed
b) Loss than the normal speed
c) Normal speed
d) Zero
a
