12. 400-V dc shunt motor takes a current of 5.6 A on no-load and 68.3 A on full-load. Armature reaction weakens the field by 3%. What is the ratio of full-load speed to no-load speed? Given: Ra = 0.18 Ω, brush voltage drop= 2 V, Rf = 200 Ω.
a) 1.2
b) 0.8
c) 1.4
d) 1
d
No-load:
Ia0 = 5.6 – 2 = 3.6 A
Ea0 = 400 – 0.18 \ 3.6 – 2 = 397.4 V
Full-load:
Ib>a (fl) = 68.3 – 2 = 66.3 A
Ea (fl) = 400 – 0.18 / 66.3 – 2 = 386.1 V
n (fl)/n (nl) = [386.1/397.4] [1/0.97] = 1.
13. In which of the following method, effect of armature reaction is more?
a) Field weakening method
b) Armature resistance control
c) Same in both methods
d) Cannot be determined
a
