1. Why starters are required in a DC motor?
a) Back emf of these motors is zero initially
b) These motors are not self-starting
c) These motors have high starting torque
d) To restrict armature current as there is no back emf at starting
d
2. For which motors DOL starter can be used?
a) Up to 5 H.P
b) Up to 10 H.P
c) Up to 15 H.P
d) Up to 20 H.P
a
3. A three-point starter is used for _________
a) Shunt motors
b) Shunt as well as compound motors
c) Shunt, compound and series motors
d) Not for DC motors
b
4. The starting resistance of a DC shunt motor is generally ______
a) low
b) Around 0.5 kΩ
c) Around 5 kΩ
d) Infinitely large
a
5. In a manual shunt motor starter relay positions are ________________________
a) Over load relay is connected in series and no volt relay in parallel with the load
b) Over load relay is connected in parallel and no volt relay in series with the load
c) Over load relay and no volt relay are both connected in series with the load
d) Over load relay and no volt relay are both connected in parallel with the load
a
6. What will happen if DC motor is used without starter?
a) Heavy sparking at brushes
b) It’ll start smoothly
c) Will not start at all
d) Depends on load
a
7. Motor will start quickly when used without starter.
a) True
b) False
a
8. In shunt and compound motor starting the shunt field should be made on with full starting resistance in ____________
a) Series with field
b) Parallel with field
c) Series with armature
d) Parallel with armature
c
9. A starter is required for a 220-V shunt motor. The maximum allowable current is 55 A and the minimum current is about 35 A. The armature resistance of the motor is 0.4 Ω. What will be the number of sections of starter resistance required?
a) 5
b) 4
c) 6
d) 8
c
So, γ= Ratio of upper limit to the lower limit = 55/35 = 1.57, R1= 200/55= 4 Ω
Now, γn-1 = 4/0.4 = 10. By substituting γ value, we get n = 6.
10. γ is given as 1.585. Resistance at maximum allowable current is given equal to 4 Ω, what is the 5th step resistance?
a) 0.235
b) 0.370
c) 1.476
d) 2
a
r1= (1-0.631) * 4 = 1.476 Ω
 r2= 1.476*0.631= 0.931 Ω, similarly calculating till r5= 0.235 Ω.
11. Four-point starter is used when ______________
a) Motor field current is varied in narrow range
b) Motor speed is varied in small range
c) Motor field current is varied over wide range
d) Can be used anywhere
c
