1. What will be the value of “Yf + Yb” for a wave winding?
a) Equal to Yc
b) Half of the Yc value
c) Double of the Yc value
d) Four times Yc value
c
1 + 2*Yc – Yf = 1+ Yb
So Yf + Yb = 2Yc.
2. For a progressive wave winding Yc = ______
a) 2C/P
b) 2(C+1)/P
c) 2(C-1)/P
d) 2C/(P+1)
b
Yc (P/2) = (C+1)
 Yc = 2(C+1)/P 
3. Number of parallel paths in wave winding are ______
a) Equal to P
b) Equal to P/2
c) 2
d) Depends on other parameters
c
4. What is the spacing between the brushes for a wave winding when a machine is 6-pole DC armature with 16 slots having 2-coil sides per slot and single-turn coils.
a) 4 segments
b) 8 segments
c) 16 segments
d) 12 segments
b
5. What is the relation between conductor current and armature current in wave winding?
a) Ic = Ia
b) Ic = 2Ia
c) Ic = 4Ia
d) Ic = Ia/2
d

6. For a conductor current equal to 4mA, Current carried by a particular brush in a 2-pole machine will be _____
a) 16mA
b) 8mA
c) 2mA
d) 10mA
b
7. Equalizer rings are needed in the wave winding.
a) True
b) False
b
8. For a wave winding when a machine is 6-pole DC armature with 16 slots having 2-coil sides per slot and single-turn coil, Yf value is ____
a) 5
b) 3
c) 2
d) 7
a
Yb= 2*2+1 = 5
Yc= 2(16-1)/6 = 5 segments
Yf = 2Yc – Yb = 5.
9. Wave winding machines are used in ______ currents applications.
a) High
b) Moderate
c) Low
d) Can be used anywhere
c
10. For a wave wounded machine number of brushes for small, large machines respectively is ________   _________
a) 2, 2
b) 4, 2
c) 2, P
d) Both values depend on the given conditions
c
