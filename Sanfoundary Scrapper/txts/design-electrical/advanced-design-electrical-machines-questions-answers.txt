a
2. What is the percentage of the damper windings slot pitch with respect to stator slot pitch?
a) 30%
b) 40%
c) 20%
d) 60%
c
3. What is the formula for the pole arc?
a) pole arc = number of bars per pole * stator slot pitch * 0.8
b) pole arc = number of bars per pole / stator slot pitch * 0.8
c) pole arc = number of bars per pole * stator slot pitch / 0.8
d) pole arc = 1 / number of bars per pole * stator slot pitch * 0.8
a
4. What is the formula for the length of each damper bar for small machines?
a) length of each damper bar = 1.1 * axial length
b) length of each damper bar = axial length + 0.1
c) length of each damper bar = axial length – 0.1
d) length of each damper bar = 1.1 / axial length
a
5. What is the formula for the area of cross-section of each damper bar?
a) area of cross section of each damper bar = total area of bars per pole – number of damper bars per pole
b) area of cross section of each damper bar = total area of bars per pole + number of damper bars per pole
c) area of cross section of each damper bar = total area of bars per pole / number of damper bars per pole
d) area of cross section of each damper bar = total area of bars per pole * number of damper bars per pole
c
6. What is the formula of the area of each ring short-circuiting the bars?
a) area of each ring short-circuiting the bars = (0.7-0.9) * area of damper bar
b) area of each ring short-circuiting the bars = (0.8-1) * area of damper bar
c) area of each ring short-circuiting the bars = (0.7-1) * area of damper bar
d) area of each ring short-circuiting the bars = (0.8-0.9) * area of damper bar
b
7. Given : total area = 473 mm2 and Number of bars = 8 for a rotor design, what is the value of area of each damper bar?
a) 59 mm2
b) 455 mm2
c) 475 mm2
d) 3784 mm2
a
Area of each bar = 473/8 = 59 mm2.

b) false
a
10. The pole shoe drawing is completed by fixing the height of pole shoe.
a) true
b) false
a
