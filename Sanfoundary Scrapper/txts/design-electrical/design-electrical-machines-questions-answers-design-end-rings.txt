c) maximum current in end ring= (2*3.14) * (bars per pole/2*no of poles) * current per bar
d) maximum current in end ring= (2*3.14) / (bars per pole/2*no of poles) / current per bar
c
8. What is the formula for the maximum current through each bar?
a) maximum value of the current through each bar = 2 * current through each bar
b) maximum value of the current through each bar = (2 * current through each bar)1/2
c) maximum value of the current through each bar = (2 * current through each bar)2
d) maximum value of the current through each bar = (2 * current through each bar)1/3
b
9. What is the formula for the rms value of the end ring current?
a) rms value of end ring current = (bars per pole * current per bar) / (3.14*no of poles)
b) rms value of end ring current = (bars per pole * current per bar) * (3.14*no of poles)
c) rms value of end ring current = (bars per pole * current per bar) / (no of poles)
d) rms value of end ring current = (bars per pole * current per bar) / (3.14+no of poles)
a

b) area of the ring = depth of the end ring – thickness of the end ring
c) area of the ring = depth of the end ring / thickness of the end ring
d) area of the ring = depth of the end ring * thickness of the end ring
d
