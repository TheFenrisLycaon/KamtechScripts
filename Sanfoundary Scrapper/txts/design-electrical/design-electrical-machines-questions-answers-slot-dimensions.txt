b
3. Name the slots that are commonly used.
a) parallel sided
b) square sided
c) rectangular
d) circular
a
4. How is the teeth and the minimum width designed in the machines?
a) teeth is tapered and minimum width is across the medium
b) teeth is sharpened and minimum width occurs across the air gap
c) teeth is widened and minimum width occurs across the air gap
d) teeth is reduced and minimum width occurs across the medium
a
5. What is the formula for the maximum permissible width of slot?
a) maximum permissible width = slot pitch * minimum width of the teeth
b) maximum permissible width = slot pitch + minimum width of the teeth
c) maximum permissible width = slot pitch / minimum width of the teeth
d) maximum permissible width = slot pitch – minimum width of the teeth
d
6. By how much should the depth of slot not exceed the width?
a) two times
b) three times
c) four times
d) six times
b
7. Why are slot made deeper in the machine?
a) to increase the short circuit current
b) to reduce the short circuit current
c) to increase the open circuit current
d) to reduce the open circuit current
b
8. What is the formula for the height of length of mean turn of armature?
a) length of mean turn = 2*length + 2.5*pole pitch + 0.06 kV + 0.2
b) length of mean turn = 2*length + 2*pole pitch + 0.06 kV + 0.2

b) false
a
10. What is the formula for the depth of armature core?
a) depth of armature core = flux / length of the iron core * flux density
b) depth of armature core = flux * length of the iron core * flux density
c) depth of armature core = flux / 2 * length of the iron core * flux density
d) depth of armature core = flux * 2 * length of the iron core * flux density
c
11. What is the formula for the outer diameter of the stator?
a) outer diameter = inner diameter + depth of the slots + depth of armature core
