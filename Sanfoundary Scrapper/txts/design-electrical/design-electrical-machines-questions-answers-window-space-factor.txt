1. What is window space factor?
a) window space factor = copper area in the window – total window area
b) window space factor = copper area in the window + total window area
c) window space factor = copper area in the window * total window area
d) window space factor = copper area in the window / total window area
d
2. What does the window space factor depend on?
a) it depends on the core
b) it depends on the armature
c) it depends on the insulation
d) it depends on the insulation and copper
d
3. What does the insulation and copper of the transformer depend on?
a) current rating
b) voltage rating
c) output power
d) voltage rating and output power
d
4. What is the empirical formula for calculating the value of window space factor?
a) window space factor = 10 / (30+kV)
b) window space factor = 5 * (30+kV)
c) window space factor = 10 * (30+kV)
d) window space factor = 5 / (30+kV)
a
5. What is the empirical value of window space factor, given the output is 1000kV?
a) 0.09
b) 0.9
c) 0.009
d) 0.0009
c
kV = 1000 kV, empirical value = 10/1030 = 0.009.
