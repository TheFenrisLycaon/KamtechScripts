d) (fy fcc)
c
8. The design compressive strength in terms of stress reduction factor is given by
a) Xfy
b) Xfy / γm0
c) X /fy γm0
d) Xfy γm0
b
9. The value of design compressive strength is limited to
a) fy + γm0
b) fy

d
10. The compressive strength for ISMB 400 used as a column for length 5m with both ends hinged is
a) 275 kN
b) 375.4 kN
c) 453 kN
d) 382 kN
b
KL/r = 5000/28.2 = 177.3
h/bf = 400/140 = 2.82, t = 16mm Therefore, buckling class = b
From table in IS code, fcd = 47.85MPa
Pd = Ae fcd = 7846 x 47.85 = 375.43 kN.
