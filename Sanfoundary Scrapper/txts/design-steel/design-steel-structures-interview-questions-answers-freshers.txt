1. Which of the following equation is correct for bolt subjected to combined shear and tension?
a) (Vsb/Vdb)2 + (Tsb/Tdb)2 ≤ 1
b) (Vsb/Vdb)2 + (Tsb/Tdb)2 ≥ 1
c) (Vsb/Vdb) + (Tsb/Tdb) ≤ 1
d) (Vsb/Vdb) + (Tsb/Tdb) ≥ 1
a
2. Shear Capacity of HSFG bolts is
a) μfnekhFo
b) μfnekhFoγmf
c) μfnekhoγmf
d) μfnekhFo/γmf
d
3. The maximum number of bolts of diameter 25mm that can be accomodated in one row in 200mm wide flat are:
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
b
Number of bolts that can be accommodated = (200-2×62.5)/25 = 3 bolts.
4.  Calculate strength in shear of 16mm diameter of bolt of grade 4.6 for lap joint
a) 50 kN
b) 40 kN
c) 29 kN
d) 59 kN
c
Strength of bolt in shear = Anbfub/(√3 x 1.25) = 156.83x400x10-3/1.25x√3 = 28.97kN.
5. What is the value of kb in nominal bearing strength for a bolt of 20mm diameter of grade 4.6?
a) 0.5
b) 1
c) 0.97
d) 2
a
e=1.5×22=33mm, p=2.5×20=50mm
e/3d0 = 33/(3×22) = 0.5, p/3d0  -0.25 = 50/(3×22) -0.25=0.5, fub /fb  = 400/410=0.975
kb  = minimum of (e/3d0 , p/3d0  -0.25, fub /fb, 1) = 0.5.
6. Calculate bearing strength of 20mm diameter bolt of grade 4.6 for joining main plates of 10mm thick using cover plate of 8mm thick using single cover butt joint.
a) 70.26 kN
b) 109.82 kN
c) 50.18 kN
d) 29.56 kN
c
e=1.5×18=27mm, p=2.5×16=40mm
e/3d0 = 27/(3×18) = 0.5, p/3d0 -0.25 = 40/(3×18) -0.25=0.49, fub /fb = 400/410=0.975
kb = minimum of (e/3d0, p/3d0 -0.25, fub /fb,1) = 0.49
bearing strength = 2.5kbdtfu/1.25 = 2.5×0.49x16x8x400x10-3/1.25 = 50.18 kN.
7. Find the number of HSFG bolts of diameter 20mm, grade 88 for connection of member carrying factored tensile load of 200kN when no slip is permitted.
a) 5
b) 4
c) 3
d) 2
b
Assume μf=0.5, ne=1, kh=1
Slip resistance of bolt = μf ne kh Fo/1.25 = 0.5x1x1x137.22/1.25 =54.88 kN
Number of bolts required = 200/54.88 = 3.64 = 4(approximately).
8. What is the efficiency of joint when strength of bolt per pitch length is 60kN and strength of plate per pitch length is 150kN?
a) 25%
b) 30%
c) 35%
d) 40%
d
9. Strength of bolt is
a) minimum of shear strength and bearing capacity of bolt
b) maximum of shear strength and bearing capacity of bolt
c) shear strength of bolt
d) bearing capacity of bolt
a
10. Prying forces are
a) friction forces
b) shear forced
c) tensile forces
d) bending forces
c
