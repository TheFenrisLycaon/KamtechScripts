8. Calculate design wind speed for a site in a city with basic wind speed of 50 m/s, risk coefficient =1, topography factor = 1, terrain is with closely spaced buildings and height of building (class A) = 15m.
a) 40 m/s
b) 48.5 m/s
c) 50 m/s
d) 52.5 m/s
b
for terrain with closely spaced buildings, height of building=15m, class A : k2=0.97 (from IS 875 Part 3)
Vz = k1k2k3Vb  = 1×0.97x1x50 = 48.5 m/s.

a
10. Calculate the design wind pressure if the basic wind speed is 44 m/s, risk coefficient is 1, topography factor is 1, terrain is with closely spaced buildings and height of building(class A) = 20m .
a) 1285 N/m2
b) 1580 N/m2
c) 1085 N/m2
d) 1185 N/m2
d
for terrain with closely spaced buildings, height of building=20m, class A: k2=1.01 (from IS 875 Part 3)
 Vz = k1k2k3Vb = 1×1.01x1x44 = 44.44 m/s
pz = 0.6Vz2 = 0.6x(44.44)2 = 1184.95 N/m2.
