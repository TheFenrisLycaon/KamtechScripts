1. What is the yield strength of bolt of class 4.6?
a) 400 N/mm2
b) 240 N/mm2
c) 250 N/mm2
d) 500 N/mm2
b
yield strength / ultimate strength = 0.6
yield strength = 0.6×400 = 240 N/mm2.
2. Which of the following is correct?
a) size of hole = nominal diameter of fastener – clearances
b) size of hole = nominal diameter of fastener x clearances
c) size of hole = nominal diameter of fastener / clearances
d) size of hole = nominal diameter of fastener + clearances
d
Clearance may be standard size, oversize, short slotted or long slotted.
3. High strength bolt is used for ____________
a) shear connection
b) slip resistant connection only
c) bearing type connection only
d) both slip resistant and bearing type connection
d
4. Which of the following is advantage of HSFG bolts over bearing type bolts?
a) joints are not rigid
b) bolts are subjected to shearing and bearing stresses
c) high strength fatigue
d) low static strength
c
5. Which of the following is correct for pitch of the bolts and gauge?
a) pitch is measured along direction of load, gauge is measured perpendicular to direction of load
b) pitch is measured perpendicular direction of load, gauge is measured along to direction of load
c) pitch is measured along direction of load, gauge is measured along to direction of load
d) pitch is measured perpendicular direction of load, gauge is measured perpendicular to direction of load

d) 30%
a
10. What is the difference between end and edge distance?
a) Edge distance is measured parallel to direction of stress, while end distance is measured perpendicular to direction of stress
b) Edge distance is measured parallel to direction of stress, while end distance is measured parallel to direction of stress
c) Edge distance is measured perpendicular to direction of stress, while end distance is measured perpendicular to direction of stress
