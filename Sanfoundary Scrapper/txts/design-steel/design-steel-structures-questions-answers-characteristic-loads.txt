a
3. What is P-Δ effect?
a) earthquake load
b) second order moments arising from joint displaced
c) second order moments arising from member deflection

b
4. Match the pair :
	(A) Mass and gravitational effect		(i) wind load
	(B) Mass and acceleration effect 		(ii) load due to settlement
	(C) Environmental effects			(iii) imposed load
a) A-i, B-ii, C-iii
b) A-iii, B-ii, C-i
c) A-iii, B-i, C-ii
d) A-ii, B-iii, C-i
c
1) Mass and gravitational effect : examples of such loads are dead loads, imposed loads, snow and ice loads, earth loads, etc.
2) Mass and acceleration effect : examples of such loads are those caused by earthquake, wind, impact, blasts, etc.
3) Environmental effects : examples of such loads are due to temperature difference, settlement, shrinkage, etc. 
5. The probability that a specific load will be exceeded during life of structure depends on _______
a) wind
b) factor of safety
c) partial factor of safety
d) period of exposure
d
6. What is characteristic load?
a) seismic load
b) load which will be exceeded by certain probability during life of structure
c) load which will not be exceeded by certain probability during life of structure
d) pressure load
c
7. Which of the following  is not included in imposed load classification?
a) Residential load
b) Earthquake load
c) Industrial load
d) Educational load
b
8. What is the minimum imposed load on roof trusses as per IS code?
a) 0.5 kN/m2
b) 0.4 kN/m2
c) 0.9 kN/m2
d) 0.75 kN/m2
b
9. For roofs of slope greater than 10˚, the imposed load is reduced by ____ for every degree rise in slope.
a) 0.02 kN/m2
b) 0.05 kN/m2
c) 0.75 kN/m2
d) 0.5 kN/m2
a
10. Calculate imposed load on roof truss of span 20m with slope of 20o.
a) 0.75 kN/m2
b) 0.95 kN/m2
c) 0.45 kN/m2
d) 0.55 kN/m2
d
Therefore, Imposed load = 0.75 – 0.02*(20o-10o) = 0.55 kN/m2.
