b
6. Structures are designed for seismic forces which is ____ than expected seismic force.
a) lesser
b) greater
c) equal to
d) seismic forces are not considered
a
7. Which of the following factors does not influence earthquake resistance design?
a) geographical location of structure
b) wind of location
c) site soil
d) strength of structure
b
8. Structures should be designed such that ___________
a) Minor and frequent earthquakes can collapse the structure
b) Moderate earthquakes can cause damage to the structure
c) Major earthquakes should not cause any damage to the structure and the structure should be functional
d) Minor earthquake should not cause any damage to the structure and the structure should be functional
d
(i) Minor and frequent earthquakes should not cause any damage to the structure
(ii) Moderate earthquake should not cause significant structural damage but could have some non structural damage(the structure should become operational once the damage is repaired)
(iii) Major and infrequent earthquake should not cause collapse( structure will be dysfunctional for further use, but will stand so that people can be evacuated and property can be recovered).
