1. Limit State Method is based on _____________
a) calculations on service load conditions alone
b) calculations on ultimate load conditions alone
c) calculations at working loads and ultimate loads
d) calculations on earthquake loads
c
2. What is limit state?
a) Acceptable limits for safety and serviceability requirements before failure occurs
b) Acceptable limits for safety and serviceability requirements after failure occurs
c) Acceptable limits for safety after failure occurs
d) Acceptable limits for serviceability after failure occurs
a
3. Which of the following format is used in limit state method?
a) Single safety factor
b) Multiple safety factor
c) Load factor
d) Wind factor
b
4. Which of the following factors is included in the limit state of strength?
a) Fire
b) Failure by excessive deformation
c) Corrosion
d) Repairable damage or crack due to fatigue
b
5. Which of the following factors is included in the limit state of serviceability?
a) Brittle facture
b) Fracture due to fatigue
c) Failure by excessive deformation
d) Deformation and deflection adversely affecting appearance or effective use of structure
d
6. What is permanent action according to classification of actions by IS code?
a) due to self weight
b) due to construction and service stage loads
c) due to accidents
d) due to earthquake loads
a
7. What is variable action according to classification of actions by IS code?
a) due to self weight
b) due to accidents
c) due to construction and service stage loads
d) due to earthquake loads
c
8. Which of the following relation is correct?
a) Design Load = Characteristic Load
b) Design Load = Characteristic Load + Partial factor of safety
c) Design Load = Characteristic Load / Partial factor of safety
d) Design Load = Characteristic Load x Partial factor of safety
d
This partial safety factor accounts for possibility of unfavourable deviation of load from characteristic value, inaccurate assessment of load, uncertainty in assessment of effects of load and in assessment of limit state being considered.
9.  Which of the following relation is correct?
a) Design Strength = Ultimate strength + Partial factor of safety
b) Design Strength = Ultimate strength – Partial factor of safety
c) Design Strength = Ultimate strength /Partial factor of safety
d) Design Strength = Ultimate strength x Partial factor of safety
c
This partial safety factor accounts for possibility of unfavourable deviation of material strength from characteristic value, variation of member sizes, reduction in member strength due to fabrication and tolerances and uncertainty in calculation of strength of members.
10. Which of the following criteria is to be satisfied in selection of member in limit state method?
a) Factored Load > Factored Strength
b) Factored Load ≤ Factored Strength
c) Factored Load ≥ Factored Strength
d) Sometimes Factored Load < Factored Strength (or) Factored Load > Factored Strength
b
11. The partial factor of safety for resistance governed by yielding is :
a) 1.10
b) 1.5
c) 2.0
d) 1.25
a
12. The partial factor of safety for resistance governed by ultimate strength is :
a) 1.10
b) 1.5
c) 2.0
d) 1.25
d
