1. Why is a demultiplexer called a data distributor?
a) The input will be distributed to one of the outputs
b) One of the inputs will be selected for the output
c) The output will be distributed to one of the inputs
d) Single input gives single output
a
2. Most demultiplexers facilitate which type of conversion?
a) Decimal-to-hexadecimal
b) Single input, multiple outputs
c) AC to DC
d) Odd parity to even parity
b
3. In 1-to-4 demultiplexer, how many select lines are required?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
a
4. In a multiplexer the output depends on its ____________
a) Data inputs
b) Select inputs
c) Select outputs
d) Enable pin
b
5. In 1-to-4 multiplexer, if C1 = 1 & C2 = 1, then the output will be ____________
