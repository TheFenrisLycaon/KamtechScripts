b) NOT gate
c) Both controlled buffer and NOT gate
d) Controlled gate
c
2. Why XOR gate is called an inverter?
a) Because of the same input
b) Because of the same output
c) It behaves like a NOT gate
d) It behaves like a AND gate
c
3. Controlled buffers can be useful ____________
a) To control the circuit’s output into the bus
b) In comparison of component’s output with its input
c) In increasing the output from its low input
d) All of the Mentioned
a
4. A logic circuit that provides a HIGH output for both inputs HIGH or both inputs LOW is ____________
a) Ex-NOR gate
b) OR gate
c) Ex-OR gate
d) NAND gate
a
5. What is the first thing you will need if you are going to use a macro-function?
a) A complicated design project
b) An experienced design engineer
c) Good documentation
d) Experience in HDL
d
6. What is the major difference between half-adders and full-adders?
a) Full-adders are made up of two half-adders
b) Full adders can handle double-digit numbers
c) Full adders have a carry input capability
d) Half adders can handle only single-digit numbers
c
7. The binary subtraction of 0 – 0 =?
a) Difference = 0, borrow = 0
b) Difference = 1, borrow = 0
c) Difference = 1, borrow = 1
d) Difference = 0, borrow = 1
a
