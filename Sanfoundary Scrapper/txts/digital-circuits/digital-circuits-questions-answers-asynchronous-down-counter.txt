1. Which of the following statements are true?
a) Asynchronous events does not occur at the same time
b) Asynchronous events are controlled by a clock
c) Synchronous events does not need a clock to control them
d) Only asynchronous events need a control clock
a
2. A down counter using n-flip-flops count ______________
a) Downward from a maximum count
b) Upward from a minimum count
c) Downward from a minimum to maximum count
d) Toggles between Up and Down count
a
3. UP Counter is ____________
a) It counts in upward manner
b) It count in down ward manner
c) It counts in both the direction
d) Toggles between Up and Down count
a
4. DOWN counter is ____________
a) It counts in upward manner
b) It count in downward manner
c) It counts in both the direction
d) Toggles between Up and Down count
b
5. How many different states does a 3-bit asynchronous down counter have?
a) 2
b) 4
c) 6
d) 8
d
Therefore, in a 3-bit counter, the total number of states = 23 = 8 states.
6. In a down counter, which flip-flop doesn’t toggle when the inverted output of the preceeding flip-flop goes from HIGH to LOW.
a) MSB flip-flop
b) LSB flip-flop
c) Master slave flip-flop
d) Latch
b
7. In a 3-bit asynchronous down counter, the initial content is ____________
a) 000
b) 111
c) 010
d) 101
a
8. In a 3-bit asynchronous down counter, at the first negative transition of the clock, the counter content becomes ____________
a) 000
b) 111
c) 101
d) 010
b
9. In a 3-bit asynchronous down counter, at the first negative transition of the clock, the counter content becomes ____________
a) 000
b) 111
c) 101
d) 010
c
10. The hexadecimal equivalent of 15,536 is ________
a) 3CB0
b) 3C66
c) 63C0
d) 6300
a
11. In order to check the CLR function of a counter ____________
a) Apply the active level to the CLR input and check all of the Q outputs to see if they are all in their reset state
b) Ground the CLR input and check to be sure that all of the Q outputs are LOW
c) Connect the CLR input to Vcc and check to see if all of the Q outputs are HIGH
d) Connect the CLR to its correct active level while clocking the counter; check to make sure that all of the Q outputs are toggling
