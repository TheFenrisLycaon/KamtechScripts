1. In boolean algebra, the OR operation is performed by which properties?
a) Associative properties
b) Commutative properties
c) Distributive properties
d) All of the Mentioned
d
             The expression for Commutative property is given by A+B = B+A & A*B = B*A.
	     The expression for Distributive property is given by A+BC=(A+B)(A+C) & A(B+C) = AB+AC.
2. The expression for Absorption law is given by _________
a) A + AB = A
b) A + AB = B
c) AB + AA’ = A
d) A + B = B + A
a
Proof: A + AB = A(1+B) = A (Since 1 + B = 1 as per 1’s Property).
3. According to boolean law: A + 1 = ?
a) 1
b) A
c) 0
d) A’
a
4. The involution of A is equal to _________
a) A
b) A’
c) 1
d) 0
a
Proof:  ((A)’)’ = A
5. A(A + B) = ?
a) AB
b) 1
c) (1 + AB)
d) A
d
