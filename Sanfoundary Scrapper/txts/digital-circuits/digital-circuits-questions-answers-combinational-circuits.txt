1. Which of the circuits in figure (a to d) is the sum-of-products implementation of figure (e)?
a) a
b) b
c) c
d) d
d
2. Which of the following logic expressions represents the logic diagram shown?
a) X=AB’+A’B
b) X=(AB)’+AB
c) X=(AB)’+A’B’
d) X=A’B’+AB
d
             2nd AND gate’s output is = AB and,
             OR gate’s output is = (A’B’)+(AB) = AB + A’B’.
3. The device shown here is most likely a ________
a) Comparator
b) Multiplexer
c) Inverter
d) Demultiplexer
d
4. What type of logic circuit is represented by the figure shown below?
a) XOR
b) XNOR
c) AND
d) XAND
b
5. For a two-input XNOR gate, with the input waveforms as shown below, which output waveform is correct?
a) d
b) a
c) c
d) b
a
i.e., A B O/P
0 0 1
0 1 0
1 0 0
1 1 1.
Thus, it will produce 1 when inputs are even number of 1s or all 0s, and produce 0 when input is odd number of 1s.
6. Which of the following combinations of logic gates can decode binary 1101?
a) One 4-input AND gate
b) One 4-input AND gate, one inverter
c) One 4-input AND gate, one OR gate
d) One 4-input NAND gate, one inverter
b
7. What is the indication of a short to ground in the output of a driving gate?
a) Only the output of the defective gate is affected
b) There is a signal loss to all load gates
c) The node may be stuck in either the HIGH or the LOW state
d) The affected node will be stuck in the HIGH state
b
8. For the device shown here, assume the D input is LOW, both S inputs are LOW and the input is LOW. What is the status of the Y’ outputs?
a) All are HIGH
b) All are LOW
c) All but Y0 are LOW
d) All but Y0 are HIGH
d
I/P S0 S1 O/P
D = 0 0 0 Y0
D = 0 0 1 Y1
D = 0 1 0 Y2
D = 0 1 1 Y3
Hence, inputs are S0 and S1 are Low means 0, so output is Y0 and rest all are HIGH.
9. The carry propagation can be expressed as ________
a) Cp = AB
b) Cp = A + B
c) All but Y0 are LOW
d) All but Y0 are HIGH
b
10. 3 bits full adder contains ________
a) 3 combinational inputs
b) 4 combinational inputs
c) 6 combinational inputs
d) 8 combinational inputs
d
