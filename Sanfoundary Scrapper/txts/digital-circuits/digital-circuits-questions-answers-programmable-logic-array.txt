b) The process of Memory IC used in a digital system is selected for the range of address assigned
c) The process of Memory IC used in a digital system is selected for the range of data assigned
d) The process of Memory IC used in a digital system is overloaded with data allocated in memory cell
b
2. The first step in the design of memory decoder is __________
a) Selection of a EPROM
b) Selection of a RAM
c) Address assignment
d) Data insertion
c
3. How many address bits are required to select memory location in the Memory decoder?
a) 4 KB
b) 8 KB
c) 12 KB
d) 16 KB
c
4. How memory expansion is done?
a) By increasing the supply voltage of the Memory ICs
b) By decreasing the supply voltage of the Memory ICs
c) By connecting Memory ICs together

c
5. IC 4116 is organised as _________
a) 512 * 4
b) 16 * 1
c) 32 * 4
d) 64 * 2
c
6. To construct 16K * 4-bit memory, how many 4116 ICs are required?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
d
7. How many 1024 * 1 RAM chips are required to construct a 1024 * 8 memory system?
a) 4
b) 6
c) 8
d) 12
c
8. How many 16K * 4 RAMs are required to achieve a memory with a capacity of 64K and a word length of 8 bits?
a) 2
b) 4
c) 6
d) 8
d
 64 * 8 = 512K RAM required. Thus, number of 16K * 4 RAMs = 512/64 = 8.
