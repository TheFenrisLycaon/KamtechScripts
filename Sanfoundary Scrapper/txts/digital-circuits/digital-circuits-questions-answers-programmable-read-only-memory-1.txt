a) Write enable time
b) Data hold
c) Read cycle time
d) Access time
d
2. Why did PROM introduced?

c
3. Which of the following is programmed electrically by the user?
a) ROM
b) EPROM
c) PROM
d) EEPROM
c
4. PROMs are available in ___________
a) Bipolar and MOSFET technologies
b) MOSFET and FET technologies

d) User-programmable, one-time programmable
d
8. How can ultraviolet erasable PROMs be recognized?
a) There is a small window on the chip
b) They will have a small violet dot next to the #1 pin
c) Their part number always starts with a “U”, such as in U12
d) They are not readily identifiable, since they must always be kept under a small cover
a
9. Which part of a Flash memory architecture manages all chip functions?
a) Program verify code
b) Floating-gate MOSFET
c) Command code
d) Input/Output pins
b
