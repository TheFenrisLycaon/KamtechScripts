a
3. A bidirectional 4-bit shift register is storing the nibble 1110. Its input is LOW. The nibble 0111 is waiting to be entered on the serial data-input line. After two clock pulses, the shift register is storing ________

b) 0111
c) 1000
d) 1001
d

Stored nibble | waiting nibble
         0111 | 1110, Initially  
          111 | 1100, 1st pulse
           11 | 1001, 2nd pulse.
