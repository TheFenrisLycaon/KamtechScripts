a
6. The group of bits 11001 is serially shifted (right-most bit first) into a 5-bit parallel output shift register with an initial state 01110. After three clock pulses, the register contains ________
a) 01110
b) 00001
c) 00101
d) 00110
c
             01110->initial
             10111->first clock pulse
             01011->second
             00101->third.
7. Assume that a 4-bit serial in/serial out shift register is initially clear. We wish to store the nibble 1100. What will be the 4-bit pattern after the second clock pulse? (Right-most bit first)
a) 1100
b) 0011
c) 0000
d) 1111
c
Wait | Store
1100 | 0000
 110 | 0000 1st clock
  11 | 0000 2nd clock.
8. A serial in/parallel out, 4-bit shift register initially contains all 1s. The data nibble 0111 is waiting to enter. After four clock pulses, the register contains ________
a) 0000
b) 1111
c) 0111
d) 1000
c
             Wait | Store
             0111 | 0000
	      011 | 1000 1st clk
               01 | 1100 2nd clk
                0 | 1110 3rd clk
                X | 1111 4th clk.
9. With a 200 kHz clock frequency, eight bits can be serially entered into a shift register in ________
a) 4 μs
b) 40 μs
c) 400 μs
d) 40 ms
b
In serial transmission, data enters one bit at a time. After 8 clock cycles only 8 bit will be loaded = 8 * 5 = 40 micro-sec.

a) 16 us
b) 8 us
c) 4 us
d) 2 us
c
