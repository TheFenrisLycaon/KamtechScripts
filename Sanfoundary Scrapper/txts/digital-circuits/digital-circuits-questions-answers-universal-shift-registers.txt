1. A sequence of equally spaced timing pulses may be easily generated by which type of counter circuit?
a) Ring shift
b) Clock
c) Johnson
d) Binary
a
2. A bidirectional 4-bit shift register is storing the nibble 1101. Its input is HIGH. The nibble 1011 is waiting to be entered on the serial data-input line. After three clock pulses, the shift register is storing ________
a) 1101
b) 0111
c) 0001
d) 1110
b
1011 | 1101
101 | 1110  -> 1st clock pulse
10 | 1111  -> 2nd  clock pulse
1 | 0111  -> 3rd clock pulse.
