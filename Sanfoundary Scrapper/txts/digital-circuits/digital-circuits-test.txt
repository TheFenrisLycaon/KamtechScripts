1. For a 4-bit parallel adder, if the carry-in is connected to a logical HIGH, the result is ___________

7. The carry propagation delay in 4-bit full-adder circuits ___________

b) Is normally not a consideration because the delays are usually in the nanosecond range
c) Decreases in direct ratio to the total number of full-adder stages
d) Increases in direct ratio to the total number of full-adder stages but is not a factor in limiting the speed of arithmetic operations
a
8. What is Manchester carry chain?
