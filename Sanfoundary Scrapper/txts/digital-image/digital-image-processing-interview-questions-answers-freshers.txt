b) h(r_k )=n/n_k
c) p(r_k )=n_k
d) h(r_k )=n_k/n
a
2. How is the expression represented for the normalized histogram?
a) p(r_k )=n_k
b) p(r_k )=n_k/n
c) p(r_k)=nn_k
d) p(r_k )=n/n_k
b
3. Which of the following conditions does the T(r) must satisfy?
a) T(r)  is double-valued and monotonically decreasing in the interval 0≤r≤1; and
  0≤T(r)≤1 for 0≤r≤1
b) T(r)  is double-valued and monotonically increasing in the interval 0≤r≤1; and
  0≤T(r)≤1 for 0≤r≤1
c) T(r)  is single-valued and monotonically decreasing in the interval 0≤r≤1; and
  0≤T(r)≤1 for 0≤r≤1
d) T(r)  is single-valued and monotonically increasing in the interval 0≤r≤1; and
  0≤T(r)≤1 for 0≤r≤1
d
               s=T(r)     For 0≤r≤1
That produces a level s for every pixel value r in the original image.
 For reasons that will become obvious shortly, we assume that the transformation function T(r) satisfies the following conditions:
T(r)  is single-valued and monotonically increasing in the interval 0≤r≤1; and
  0≤T(r)≤1 for 0≤r≤1.
4. The inverse transformation from s back to r is denoted as:
a) s=T-1(r) for 0≤s≤1
b) r=T-1(s) for 0≤r≤1
c) r=T-1(s) for 0≤s≤1
d) r=T-1(s) for 0≥s≥1
c
r=T-1(s) for 0≤s≤1.
5. The probability density function p_s (s) of the transformed variable s can be obtained by using which of the following formula?
a) p_s (s)=p_r (r)|dr/ds|
b) p_s (s)=p_r (r)|ds/dr|
c) p_r (r)=p_s (s)|dr/ds|
d) p_s (s)=p_r (r)|dr/dr|
a
Thus, the probability density function of the transformed variable, s, is determined by the gray-level PDF of the input image and by the chosen transformation function.
6. A transformation function of particular importance in image processing is represented in which of the following form?
a) s=T(r)=∫0 (2r)pr (ω)dω
b) s=T(r)=∫0 (r-1)pr (ω)dω
c) s=T(r)=∫0 (r/2)pr (ω)dω
d) s=T(r)=∫0 pr (ω)dω
d

c) sk =∑k j =0 n/nj   k=0,1,2,……,L-1
d) sk =∑k j =n nj/n   k=0,1,2,……,L-1
b
8. What is the method that is used to generate a processed image that have a specified histogram?
a) Histogram linearization
b) Histogram equalization
c) Histogram matching
d) Histogram processing
c
9. Histograms are the basis for numerous spatial domain processing techniques.
a) True
b) False
a
10. In a dark image, the components of histogram are concentrated on which side of the grey scale?
a) High
b) Medium
c) Low
d) Evenly distributed
c
