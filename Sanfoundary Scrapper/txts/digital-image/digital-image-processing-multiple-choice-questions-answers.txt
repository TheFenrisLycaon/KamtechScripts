5. Validate the statement:
“For a given image in one-dimension given by function f(x, y), to sample the function we take equally spaced samples, superimposed on the function, along a horizontal line. However, the sample values still span (vertically) a continuous range of gray-level values. So, to convert the given function into a digital function, the gray-level values must be divided into various discrete levels.”
a)	True
b)	False
a
