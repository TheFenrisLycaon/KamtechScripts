1. The length of a boundary is one of the boundary descriptors.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Which of the following of a boundary is defined as the line perpendicular to the major axis?
a) Equilateral axis
b) Equidistant axis
c) Minor axis
d) Median axis
c
3. Which of the following is the useful descriptor of a boundary, whose value is given by the ratio of length of the major axis to the minor axis?
a) Radius
b) Perimeter
c) Area
d) Eccentricity
d
4. The term, Curvature is defined as:
a) Rate of change of area
b) Rate of change of slope
c) Slope
d) Rate of change of diameter
b
5. If the boundary is traversed in the clockwise direction, a vertex point ‘p’ is said to be a part of the convex segment if the rate of change of slope at ‘p’ is:
a) Negative
b) Zero
c) Non negative
d) Cannot be determined
c
6. A point ‘p’ is said to be corner point, if the change of slope is less than 100.
a) True
b) False
b
7. Based on the 4-directional code, the first difference of smallest magnitude is called as:
a) Shape number
b) Chain number
c) Difference
d) Difference number
a
8. The order of shape number for a closed boundary is:
a) Odd
b) Even
c) 1
d) Any positive value
b
9. What is the order of the shape number of a rectangular boundary with the dimensions of 3×3?
a) 3
b) 6
c) 9
d) 12
d
10. The chain code for the following shape is given as:
a) 000030032232221211
b) 003010203310321032
c) 022332103210201330
d) 012302301023100321
a
So, the chain code is given as 000030032232221211.
11. What is the shape number for the boundary given in the previous figure?
a) 003231023101230123
b) 012301220331023010
c) 133021030012330120
d) 000310330130031303
d
We know that, shape number is the first difference of a chain coded boundary. Thus the shape number of the above given boundary will be 000310330130031303.
