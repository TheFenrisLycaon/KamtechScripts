d
2.	Sharpening is analogous to which of the following operations?

3.	Which of the following fact(s) is/are true about sharpening spatial filters using digital differentiation?

d)	All of the mentioned
c
	Must be zero in the flat areas i.e. areas of constant grey values.
	Must be nonzero at the onset of a gray-level step or ramp discontinuities.

a
∂f/∂x= f(x+1)-f(x), where the partial derivative is used to keep notation same even for f(x, y) when partial derivative will be dealt along two spatial axes.
7.	The derivative of digital function is defined in terms of difference. Then, which of the following defines the second order derivative ∂2 f/∂x2 = ___________ of a one-dimensional function f(x)?
a)	f(x+1)-f(x)

c)	All of the mentioned depending upon the time when partial derivative will be dealt along two spatial axes
d)	None of the mentioned
b
 (∂2 f)/∂x2 =f(x+1)+ f(x-1)-2f(x), where the partial derivative is used to keep notation same even for f(x, y) when partial derivative will be dealt along two spatial axes.
8.	What kind of relation can be obtained between first order derivative and second order derivative of an image having a on the basis of edge productions that shows a transition like a ramp of constant slope?

b)	Second order derivative has a stronger response than a first order
c)	Both enhances the same and so the response is same for both first and second order derivative
d)	None of the mentioned
b
10.	What kind of relation can be obtained between the response of first order derivative and second order derivative of an image having a transition into gray-level step from zero?

b)	Second order derivative has a stronger response than a first order
c)	Both first and second order derivative has the same response
d)	None of the mentioned
c
