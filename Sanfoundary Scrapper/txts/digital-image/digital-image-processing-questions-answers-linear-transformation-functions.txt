d
5. A contrast stretching result been obtained by setting (r1, s1) = (rmin, 0) and (r2, s2) = (rmax, L – 1), where, r and s are gray-values of image before and after processing respectively, L is the max gray value allowed and rmax and rmin are maximum and minimum gray-values in image respectively. What should we term the transformation function if r1 = r2 = m, some mean gray-value.
a)	Linear function
b)	Thresholding function
c)	Intermediate function
d)	None of the mentioned
b
6. A specific range of gray-levels highlighting is the basic idea of __________
a)	Contrast stretching
b)	Bit –plane slicing
c)	Thresholding
d)	Gray-level slicing
d
Second approach is to brighten the pixels gray-value of interest and preserve the background.
I.e. in both highlighting of a specific range of gray-level is been done.
7. What is/are the approach(s) of the gray-level slicing?
a)	To give all gray level of a specific range high value and a low value to all other gray levels
b)	To brighten the pixels gray-value of interest and preserve the background
c)	All of the mentioned
d)	None of the mentioned
c
One approach is to give all gray level of a specific range high value and a low value to all other gray levels.
Second approach is to brighten the pixels gray-value of interest and preserve the background.
8. Which of the following transform produces a binary image after processing?
a)	Contrast stretching
b)	Gray-level slicing
c)	All of the mentioned
d)	None of the mentioned
c
One of the transformation in Contrast stretching darkens the value of r (input image gray-level) below m (some predefined gray-value) and brightens the value of r above m, giving a binary image as result.
9. Specific bit contribution in the image highlighting is the basic idea of __________
a)	Contrast stretching
b)	Bit –plane slicing
c)	Thresholding
d)	Gray-level slicing
b
10. In bit-plane slicing if an image is represented by 8 bits and is composed of eight 1-bit plane, with plane 0 showing least significant bit and plane 7 showing most significant bit. Then, which plane(s) contain the majority of visually significant data.

b)	Plane 0, 1, 2, 3
c)	Plane 0
d)	Plane 2, 3, 4, 5
a
11. Which of the following helps to obtain the number of bits to be used to quantize each pixel.
a)	Gray-level slicing
b)	Contrast stretching
c)	Contouring
d)	Bit-plane slicing
d
