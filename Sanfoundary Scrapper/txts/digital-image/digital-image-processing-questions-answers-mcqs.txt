1. What does the total number of pixels in the region defines?
a) Perimeter
b) Area
c) Intensity
d) Brightness
b
2. What is the unit of compactness of a region?
a) Meter
b) Meter2
c) No units
d) Meter-1
c
3. For which of the following regions, compactness is minimal?
a) Rectangle
b) Square
c) Irregular
d) Disk
d
4. Compactness is insensitive to orientation.
a) True
b) False
a
5. Which of the following measures are not used to describe a region?
a) Mean and median of grey values
b) Minimum and maximum of grey values
c) Number of pixels alone
d) Number of pixels above and below mean
c
6. We cannot use normalized area as one of the region descriptor.
a) True
b) False
b
7. What is the study of properties of a figure that are unaffected by any deformation?
a) Topology
b) Geography
c) Statistics
d) Deformation
a
8. On which of the following operation of an image, the topology of the region changes?
a)  Stretching
b) Rotation
c) Folding
d) Change in distance measure
c
9. Topological properties don’t depend on the distance measures.
a) True
b) False
a
10. What is the Euler number of the image shown below?
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) -1
d
11. What is the Euler number of a region with polygonal network containing V,Q and F as the number of vertices, edges and faces respectively?
a) V+Q+F
b) V-Q+F
c) V+Q-F
d) V-Q-F
b
		V-Q+F=C-H
Where C,H represents the number of connected components and number of holes in the region respectively. So, the Euler number E is given by V-Q+F.
12. What is the Euler number of the region shown in the figure below?
a) 1
b) -2
c) -1
d) 2
b
E=V-Q+F=7-11+2=-2.
13. The texture of the region provides measure of which of the following properties?
a) Smoothness alone
b) Coarseness alone
c) Regularity alone
d) Smoothness, coarseness and regularity
d
14. Structural techniques deal with the arrangement of image primitives.
a) True
b) False
