(a) Original image. (b) Result using global histogram equalization. (c) Result using local histogram equalization using 7*7 neighborhood about each pixel.
7.	Let us suppose an image containing a quite small square under a large dark square with both having very close gray level values. If an image contains some of this such that the small squares can’t be visualized and some noise blurred enough to reduce its noise content as shown in fig. below, Which of the following method would be preferred for obtaining the small square clear enough?
 Figure: original image.
a)	Global histogram equalization
b)	Local histogram equalization
c)	All of the mentioned
d)	None of the mentioned
b
But, local histogram enhancement using a 7*7 neighborhood reveals the small square.
(a) Original image. (b) Result using global histogram equalization. (c) Result using local histogram equalization using 7*7 neighborhood about each pixel.
8.	In terms of enhancement, what does mean and variance refers to?
a)	Average contrast and average gray level respectively
b)	Average gray level and average contrast respectively
c)	Average gray level in both
d)	Average contrast in both
b
Given by, mean as: m = ∑_(i=0)^(L-1) ri p(ri )	and variance as: σ2(r) = ∑_(i=0)^(L-1) (ri –m)2 p(ri ).
Where, ri is histogram component of ith value of r, p(ri) is probability occurrence of gray level ri and L is the max gray value allowed.
9.	For a local enhancement using mean and variance, there is one condition:		ms(x, y) ≤ k0 MG, where, MG is global mean, k0 a constant and ms(x, y) a measure of gray value as light or dark at point (x, y). Then, which fact is true for k0?
a)	It is a negative constant with values less than -1.0
b)	It is a positive constant with values less than 1.0
c)	It is an integer constant with values between -1.0 and 1.0
d)	None of the mentioned
b
10.	For a local enhancement using mean and variance, there is one condition:		σs(x, y) ≤ k2DG, where, MDG is global standard deviation, k2 a positive constant and σs(x, y) a measure of contrast at point (x, y). Then, which fact is true for k2 if its values is less than 1.0?
a)	Enhancement is being done on light areas
b)	Enhancement is being done on dark areas
c)	Enhancement is being done independent of value of k0
d)	None of the mentioned
b
11.	For a local enhancement using mean and variance, there is one condition:		σs(x, y) ≤ k2DG,  where, MDG is global standard deviation, k2 a positive constant and σs(x, y) a measure of contrast at point (x, y). Then, which fact is true for k2 if its values is greater than 1.0?
a)	Enhancement is being done on light areas
