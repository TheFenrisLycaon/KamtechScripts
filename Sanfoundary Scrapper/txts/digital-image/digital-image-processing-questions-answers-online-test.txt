1. The principal factor to determine the spatial resolution of an image is _______
a)	Quantization
b)	Sampling
c)	Contrast
d)	Dynamic range
b
2. What causes the effect, imperceptible set of very fine ridge like structures in areas of smooth gray levels?
a)	Caused by the use of an insufficient number of gray levels in smooth areas of a digital image
b)	Caused by the use of huge number of gray levels in smooth areas of a digital image
c)	All of the mentioned
d)	None of the mentioned
a
3. What is the name of the effect caused by the use of an insufficient number of gray levels in smooth areas of a digital image?
a)	Dynamic range
b)	Ridging
c)	Graininess
d)	False contouring
d
4. Using rough rule of thumb, and assuming powers of 2 for convenience, what image size are about the smallest images that can be expected to be reasonably free of objectionable sampling checkerboards and false contouring?
a)	512*512pixels and 16 gray levels
b)	256*256pixels and 64 gray levels
c)	64*64pixels and 16 gray levels
d)	32*32pixels and 32 gray levels
b
Also the effect is quite visible in images displayed using 16 or less uniformly spaced gray levels.
5. What does a shift up and right in the curves of isopreference curve simply means? Verify in terms of N (number of pixels) and k (L=2k, L is the gray level) values.
a)	Smaller values for N and k, implies a better picture quality
b)	Larger values for N and k, implies low picture quality
c)	Larger values for N and k, implies better picture quality
d)	Smaller values for N and k, implies low picture quality
c

6. How does the curves behave to the detail in the image in isopreference curve?
a)	Curves tend to become more vertical as the detail in the image decreases
b)	Curves tend to become less vertical as the detail in the image increases
c)	Curves tend to become less vertical as the detail in the image decreases
d)	Curves tend to become more vertical as the detail in the image increases
d
The right side graph shows the same, curve for crowd is nearly vertical.
 
7. For an image with a large amount of detail, if the value of N (number of pixels) is fixed then what is the gray level dependency in the perceived quality of this type of image?
a)	Totally independent of the number of gray levels used
b)	Nearly independent of the number of gray levels used
c)	Highly dependent of the number of gray levels used
d)	None of the mentioned
b
8. What is a band-limited function?
a)	A function of limited duration whose highest frequency is finite
b)	A function of limited duration whose highest frequency is infinite
c)	All of the mentioned
d)	None of the mentioned
a
9. For a band-limited function, which Theorem says that “if the function is sampled at a rate equal to or greater than twice its highest frequency, the original function can be recovered from its samples”?
a)	Band-limitation theorem
b)	Aliasing frequency theorem
c)	Shannon sampling theorem
d)	None of the mentioned
c
10. What is the name of the phenomenon that corrupts the sampled image, and how does it happen?
a)	Shannon sampling, if the band-limited functions are undersampled
b)	Shannon sampling, if the band-limited functions are oversampled
c)	Aliasing, if the band-limited functions are undersampled
d)	Aliasing, if the band-limited functions are oversampled
c
11. How aliasing does corrupts the sampled image?
a)	By introducing additional frequency components to the sampled function
b)	By removing some frequency components from the sampled function
c)	All of the mentioned
d)	None of the mentioned
a
12. How can one reduce the aliasing effect on an image?
a)	By reducing the high-frequency components of image by blurring the image
b)	By increasing the high-frequency components of image by blurring the image
c)	By reducing the high-frequency components of image by clarifying the image
d)	By increasing the high-frequency components of image by clarifying the image
