a)	If for any pixel p in S, the set of pixels that are connected to it in Sis only one
b)	If it only has one connected component
c)	If S is a region
d)	All of the mentioned
d
For any pixel p in S, the set of pixels is called a connected component of S if connected to p in S. The set S is called a connected set if it only has one connected component.
S, is a region of the image if S is a connected set.
6. Let R be a subset of pixels in an image. How can we define the contour of R?
a)	If R is a region, and the set of pixels in R have one or more neighbors that are not in R
b)	If R is an entire image, then the set of pixels in the first and last rows and columns of R

c
The boundary or contour of a region R is the set of pixels in the region that have one or more neighbors that are not in R.
In case R is an entire image, then its boundary is defined as the set of pixels in the first and last rows and columns of the image.

11. The domain that refers to image plane itself and the domain that refers to Fourier transform of an image is/are :
a)	Spatial domain in both
b)	Frequency domain in both
c)	Spatial domain and Frequency domain respectively
d)	Frequency domain and Spatial domain respectively
c
Techniques based on Frequency domain processing are based on modifying the Fourier transform of an image.
12. What is the technique for a gray-level transformation function called, if the transformation would be to produce an image of higher contrast than the original by darkening the levels below some gray-level m and brightening the levels above m in the original image.
a)	Contouring
b)	Contrast stretching
c)	Mask processing
d)	 Point processing
b
Then the technique, contrast stretching compresses the value of r below m by transformation function into a narrow range of s, towards black and brightens the value of r above m.
