1. In frequency domain terminology, which of the following is defined as “obtaining a highpass filtered image by subtracting from the given image a lowpass filtered version of itself”?
a)	Emphasis filtering
b)	Unsharp masking
c)	Butterworth filtering
d)	None of the mentioned
b
2. Which of the following is/ are a generalized form of unsharp masking?
a)	Lowpass filtering
b)	High-boost filtering
c)	Emphasis filtering
d)	All of the mentioned
b
3. High boost filtered image is expressed as: fhb = A f(x, y) – flp(x, y), where f(x, y) the input image, A is a constant and flp(x, y) is the lowpass filtered version of f(x, y). Which of the following fact validates if A=1?
a)	High-boost filtering reduces to regular Highpass filtering
b)	High-boost filtering reduces to regular Lowpass filtering
c)	All of the mentioned
d)	None of the mentioned
a
i.e.  fhb = (A-1) f(x, y) + fhp(x, y). So, when A=1, High-boost filtering reduces to regular Highpass filtering.
4. High boost filtered image is expressed as: fhb = A f(x, y) – flp(x, y), where f(x, y) the input image, A is a constant and flp(x, y) is the lowpass filtered version of f(x, y). Which of the following fact(s) validates if A increases past 1?
a)	The contribution of the image itself becomes more dominant
b)	The contribution of the highpass filtered version of image becomes less dominant
c)	All of the mentioned
d)	None of the mentioned
c
i.e.  fhb = (A-1) f(x, y) + fhp(x, y). So, when A>1, the contribution of the image itself becomes more dominant over the highpass filtered version of image.

b)	Add an offset to the highpass filter to prevent eliminating zero frequency term by filter
c)	All of the mentioned combined and applied
d)	None of the mentioned
c
