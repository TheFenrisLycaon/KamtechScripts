1.	“For very large value of A, a high boost filtered image is approximately equal to the original image”. State whether the statement is true or false?
a)	True
b)	False
a
2.	Subtracting Laplacian from an image is proportional to which of the following?
a)	Unsharp masking
b)	Box filter
c)	Median filter
d)	None of the mentioned
a
f(x,y)- ∇2 f(x,y) = f(x, y) – [f(x + 1, y) + f(x – 1, y) + f(x, y + 1) + f(x, y – 1) – 4f(x, y)]
That on calculation gives 5[1.2 f(x, y) – f ̅(x, y)] ≈ 5[f(x, y) – f(x, y)]
Where f(x, y) – f(x, y) is the unsharp masking definition.

b)	The Laplacian
c)	All of the mentioned
d)	None of the mentioned
a

b)	The component of Gradient vector are linear operator, but the magnitude are not
c)	The component of Gradient vector are nonlinear operator and also the magnitude of the vector
d)	The component of Gradient vector are nonlinear operator, but the magnitude are not
b
5.	What is the sum of the coefficient of the mask defined using gradient?
a)	1
b)	-1
c)	0
d)	None of the mentioned
c
6.	Gradient is used in which of the following area(s)?
a)	To aid humans in detection of defects
b)	As a preprocessing step for automated inspections
c)	All of the mentioned
d)	None of the mentioned

c
8.	An image has significant edge details. Which of the following fact(s) is/are true for the gradient image and the Laplacian image of the same?
a)	The gradient image is brighter than the Laplacian image
b)	The gradient image is brighter than the Laplacian image
c)	Both the gradient image and the Laplacian image has equal values
d)	None of the mentioned
