1. Low pass Butterworth filters are also called as _____________
a) All-zero filter
b) All-pole filter
c) Pole-zero filter
d) None of the mentioned
b
2. What is the equation for magnitude square response of a low pass Butterworth filter?
a) \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+(\frac{Ω}{Ω_C})^{2N}}}\) 
b) \(1+(\frac{Ω}{Ω_C})^{2N}\) 
c) \(\sqrt{1+(\frac{Ω}{Ω_C})^{2N}}\) 
d) None of the mentioned
a
|H(jΩ)| = \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+(\frac{Ω}{Ω_C})^{2N}}}\) 
where N is the order of the filter and ΩC is defined as the cutoff frequency.
3. What is the transfer function of magnitude squared frequency response of the normalized low pass Butterworth filter?
a) \(\frac{1}{1+(s/j)^{-2N}}\) 
b) \(1+(\frac{s}{j})^{-2N}\) 
c) \(1+(\frac{s}{j})^{2N}\) 
d) \(\frac{1}{1+(\frac{s}{j})^{2N}}\) 
d
|H(jΩ)|2=\(\frac{1}{1+Ω^{2N}}\) => HN(jΩ).HN(-jΩ)=\(\frac{1}{1+Ω^{2N}}\) 
Replacing jΩ by ‘s’ and hence Ω by s/j in the above equation, we get
HN(s).HN(-s)=\(\frac{1}{1+(\frac{s}{j})^{2N}}\) which is called the transfer function.
4. Which of the following is the band edge value of |H(Ω)|2?
a) (1+ε2)
b) (1-ε2)
c) 1/(1+ε2)
d) 1/(1-ε2)
c
5. The magnitude square response shown in the below figure is for which of the following given filters?
a) Butterworth
b) Chebyshev
c) Elliptical
d) None of the mentioned
a
6. What is the order of a low pass Butterworth filter that has a -3dB bandwidth of 500Hz and an attenuation of 40dB at 1000Hz?
a) 4
b) 5
c) 6
d) 7
d
For an attenuation of 40dB, δ2=0.01. We know that
N=\(\frac{log⁡[(\frac{1}{δ_2^2})-1]}{2log⁡[\frac{Ω_s}{Ω_s}]}\) 
Thus by substituting the corresponding values in the above equation, we get N=6.64
To meet the desired specifications, we select N=7.
