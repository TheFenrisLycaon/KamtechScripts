a

3. What is the frequency response of a system with input h(n) and window length of M?

b) \(\sum_{n=0}^{M} h(n)e^{jωn}\) 
c) \(\sum_{n=0}^M h(n)e^{-jωn}\) 
d) \(\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h(n)e^{-jωn}\) 
d
H(ω)=\(\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h(n)e^{-jωn}\)
4. What is the relation between H(k+α) and h(n)?
a) H(k+α)=\(\sum_{n=0}^{M+1} h(n)e^{-j2π(k+α)n/M}\); k=0,1,2…M+1
b) H(k+α)=\(\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h(n)e^{-j2π(k+α)n/M}\); k=0,1,2…M-1
c) H(k+α)=\(\sum_{n=0}^M h(n)e^{-j2π(k+α)n/M}\); k=0,1,2…M
d) None of the mentioned
b
ωk=\(\frac{2π}{M}\)(k+α) and H(ω)=\(\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h(n)e^{-jωn}\) 
Thus from substituting the first in the second equation, we get
H(k+α)=\(\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h(n)e^{-j2π(k+α)n/M}\); k=0,1,2…M-1
5. Which of the following is the correct expression for h(n) in terms of H(k+α)?
a) \(\frac{1}{M} \sum_{k=0}^{M-1}H(k+α)e^{j2π(k+α)n/M}\); n=0,1,2…M-1
b) \(\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}H(k+α)e^{j2π(k+α)n/M}\); n=0,1,2…M-1
c) \(\frac{1}{M} \sum_{k=0}^{M+1}H(k+α)e^{j2π(k+α)n/M}\); n=0,1,2…M+1
d) \(\sum_{k=0}^{M+1}H(k+α)e^{j2π(k+α)n/M}\); n=0,1,2…M+1
a
H(k+α)=\(\sum_{n=0}^{M-1} h(n)e^{-j2π(k+α)n/M}\); k=0,1,2…M-1
If we multiply the above equation on both sides by the exponential exp(j2πkm/M), m=0,1,2….M-1 and sum over k=0,1,….M-1, we get the equation
h(n)=\(\frac{1}{M} \sum_{k=0}^{M-1}H(k+α)e^{j2π(k+α)n/M}\); n=0,1,2…M-1
6. Which of the following is equal to the value of H(k+α)?
a) H*(M-k+α)
b) H*(M+k+α)
c) H*(M+k-α)

where k=0,1,2…M-1/2 and α=0 0r 1/2.
