a
2. The process of converting discrete-time continuous valued signal into discrete-time discrete valued (digital) signal is known as ____________
a) Sampling
b) Quantization
c) Coding
d) None of the mentioned
b
3. The difference between the unquantized x(n) and quantized xq(n) is known as ___________
a) Quantization coefficient
b) Quantization ratio
c) Quantization factor
d) Quantization error
d
4. Which of the following is a digital-to-analog conversion process?
a) Staircase approximation
b) Linear interpolation
c) Quadratic interpolation
d) All of the mentioned
d
5. The relation between analog frequency ‘F’ and digital frequency ‘f’ is?
a) F=f*T(where T is sampling period)
b) f=F*T
c) No relation
d) None of the mentioned
b
6. What is output signal when a signal x(t)=cos(2*pi*40*t) is sampled with a sampling frequency of 20Hz?
a) cos(pi*n)
b) cos(2*pi*n)
c) cos(4*pi*n)
d) cos(8*pi*n)
c
=>f=F/Fs
=>f=40/20
=>f=2Hz
=>x(n)=cos(4*pi*n).
7. If ‘F’ is the frequency of the analog signal, then what is the minimum sampling rate required to avoid aliasing?
a) F
b) 2F
c) 3F
d) 4F
a
8. What is the nyquist rate of the signal x(t)=3cos(50*pi*t)+10sin(300*pi*t)-cos(100*pi*t)?
a) 50Hz
b) 100Hz
c) 200Hz
d) 300Hz
d
Thus Fmax=150Hz and from the sampling theorem,
nyquist rate=2*Fmax
Therefore, Fs=2*150=300Hz.
9. What is the discrete-time signal obtained after sampling the analog signal x(t)=cos(2000*pi*t)+sin(5000*pi*t) at a sampling rate of 5000 samples/sec?
a) cos(2.5*pi*n)+sin(pi*n)
b) cos(0.4*pi*n)+sin(pi*n)
c) cos(2000*pi*n)+sin(5000*pi*n)
d) none of the mentioned
b
=>f1=F1/Fs and f2=F2/Fs
=>f1=0.2 and f2=0.5
=>x(n)=cos(0.4*pi*n)+sin(pi*n).
10. If the sampling rate Fs satisfies the sampling theorem, then the relation between quantization errors of analog signal(eq(t)) and discrete-time signal(eq(n)) is?
a) eq(t)=eq(n)
b) eq(t)<eq(n)
c) eq(t)>eq(n)
d) not related
a

b) 4 bit
c) 2 bit
d) 1 bit
b
