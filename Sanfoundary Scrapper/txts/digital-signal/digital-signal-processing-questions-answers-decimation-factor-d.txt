a
2. What is the folding frequency for the aliased version of x(n) with sampling rate F?
a) F/D
b) F/4D
c) F/2
d) F/2D

3. To what value should the bandwidth of x(n) has to be reduced in order to avoid aliasing?
a) F/D
b) F/2D
c) F/4D
d) None of the mentioned
b
4. Which process has a block diagram as shown in the figure below?
a) Sampling rate conversion
b) Interpolation
c) Decimation
d) None of the mentioned
c
5. Which of the following is true about the filtering operation on x(n)?
a) Linear
b) Time variant
c) None of the mentioned
d) Linear and time invariant
d
6. If x(n) produces y(m), then x(n-n0) does imply y(n-n0) for any value of n0.
a) True
b) False
b
7. The linear filtering operation followed by down sampling on x(n) is not time invariant.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Which of the following gives the equation for y(m)?
a) v(mD)
b) p(mD)
c) v(mD).p(mD)
d) none of the mentioned
c
y(m)= \(\bar{v}(mD)\)= v(mD).p(mD).
9. We need not relate the spectrum of y(m) to spectrum of x(n) to obtain frequency response characteristic of y(m).
a) True
b) False
b
10. The sequence \(\bar{v}(n)\) can be obtained by multiplying v(n) with a signal p(n) of period D.
a) True
b) False
a
11. If HD(ω) is the frequency response of the low pass filter, then for what value of ω, HD(ω)=1?
a) |ω| = π/D
b) |ω| ≥ π/D
c) |ω| ≤ π/D
d) None of the mentioned
c
HD(ω)=1, |ω| ≤ π/D
=0, otherwise.
12. The filter eliminates the spectrum of X(ω) in the range π/D < ω < π.
a) True
b) False
a
HD(ω)=1, |ω| ≤ π/D
=0, otherwise
Thus the filter eliminates the spectrum of X(ω) in the range π/D < ω < π.
