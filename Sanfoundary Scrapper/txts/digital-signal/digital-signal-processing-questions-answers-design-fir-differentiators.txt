1. How is the frequency response of an ideal differentiator related to the frequency?
a) Inversely proportional
b) Linearly proportional
c) Quadratic
d) None of the mentioned
b
2. Which of the following is the frequency response of an ideal differentiator, Hd(ω)?
a) -jω ; -π ≤ ω ≤ π
b) -jω ; 0 ≤ ω ≤ π
c) jω ; 0 ≤ ω ≤ π
d) jω ; -π ≤ ω ≤ π
d
Hd(ω)= jω ; -π ≤ ω ≤ π.
3. What is the unit sample response corresponding to Hd(ω)?
a) \(\frac{cos⁡πn}{n}\) 
b) \(\frac{sin⁡πn}{n}\) 
c) n.sin πn
d) n.cos⁡ πn
a
Hd(ω)= jω ; -π ≤ ω ≤ π
Thus, we get the unit sample response corresponding to the ideal differentiator is given as
h(n)=\(\frac{cos⁡πn}{n}\).
4. The ideal differentiator ahs which of the following unit sample response?
a) Symmetric
b) Anti-symmetric
c) Cannot be explained
d) None of the mentioned
b
h(n)=\(\frac{cos⁡πn}{n}\) 
So, we can state that the unit sample response of an ideal differentiator is anti-symmetric because cos⁡πn is also an anti-symmetric function.
5. If hd(n) is the unit sample response of an ideal differentiator, then what is the value of hd(0)?
a) 1
b) -1
c) 0
d) 0.5
c
=>hd(0)=0.

11. What is the weighting function used in the design of FIR differentiators based on the chebyshev approximation criterion?
a) 1/ω
b) ω
c) 1+ω
d) 1-ω
a
W(ω)=1/ω
in order that the relative ripple in the pass band be a constant.
12. The absolute error between the desired response ω and the approximation Hr(ω) decreases as ω varies from 0 to 2πfp.
a) True
b) False
b
W(ω)=1/ω
in order that the relative ripple in the pass band be a constant. Thus, the absolute error between the desired response ω and the approximation Hr(ω) increases as ω varies from 0 to 2πfp.
