c
y(n)=\(\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} b_k x(n-k)\) 
where {bk} is the set of filter coefficients.
2. The lower and upper limits on the convolution sum reflect the causality and finite duration characteristics of the filter.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Which of the following condition should the unit sample response of a FIR filter satisfy to have a linear phase?
a) h(M-1-n) n=0,1,2…M-1
b) &pm;h(M-1-n) n=0,1,2…M-1
c) -h(M-1-n) n=0,1,2…M-1
d) None of the mentioned
b
h(n)= &pm;h(M-1-n) n=0,1,2…M-1.
4. If H(z) is the z-transform of the impulse response of an FIR filter, then which of the following relation is true?

d
When we incorporate the symmetric and anti-symmetric conditions of the second equation into the first equation and by substituting z-1 for z, and multiply both sides of the resulting equation by z-(M-1) we get z-(M-1).H(z-1)=&pm;H(z)
