4. In which of the following fields, Hilbert transformers are frequently used?
a) Generation of SSB signals
b) Radar signal processing
c) Speech signal processing

d
5. The unit sample response of an ideal Hilbert transform is
h(n)=\(\frac{2}{\pi} \frac{(sin(\frac{πn}{2}))^{2}}{n}\); n≠0
h(n)=0; n=0
a) True
b) False
a
H(ω)= -j ;0 < ω < π
j ;-π < ω < 0
Thus the unit sample response of an ideal Hilbert transform is obtained as
h(n)=\(\frac{2}{\pi} \frac{(sin(\frac{πn}{2}))^{2}}{n}\); n≠0
h(n)=0; n=0
6. The unit sample response of Hilbert transform is infinite in duration and causal.
a) True
b) False
b
h(n)=\(\frac{2}{\pi} \frac{(sin(\frac{πn}{2}))^{2}}{n}\); n≠0
h(n)=0; n=0
it sample response of an ideal Hilbert transform is infinite in duration and non-causal.
7. The unit sample response of Hilbert transform is _______________
a) Zero
b) Symmetric
c) Anti-symmetric
d) None of the mentioned
c
h(n)=\(\frac{2}{\pi} \frac{(sin(\frac{πn}{2}))^{2}}{n}\); n≠0
h(n)=0; n=0
Thus from the above equation, we can tell that h(n)=-h(-n). Thus the unit sample response of Hilbert transform is anti-symmetric in nature.
8. In this section, we confine our attention on the design of FIR Hilbert transformers with h(n)=-h(M-1-n).
a) True
b) False
a
9. Which of the following is true regarding the frequency response of Hilbert transform?
a) Complex
b) Purely imaginary
c) Purely real
d) Zero
b
10. It is impossible to design an all-pass digital Hilbert transformer.
a) True
b) False
a
11. If fl and fu are the cutoff frequencies, then what is the desired real valued frequency response of a Hilbert transform filter in the frequency range 2π fl < ω < 2πfu?
a) -1
b) -0.5
c) 0
d) 1
d
H(ω)=1; 2π fl < ω < 2πfu
where fl and fu are the cutoff frequencies.
12. What is the value of unit sample response of an ideal Hilbert transform for ‘n’ even?
a) -1
b) 1
c) 0
d) None of the mentioned
c
h(n)=\(\frac{2}{\pi} \frac{(sin(\frac{πn}{2}))^{2}}{n}\); n≠0
h(n)=0; n=0
From the above equation, it is clear that h(n) becomes zero for even values of ‘n’.
