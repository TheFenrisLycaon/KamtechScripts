b) Laplace transform
c) Rational system function
d) All of the mentioned
d
6. For an analog LTI system to be stable, where should the poles of system function H(s) lie?
a) Right half of s-plane
b) Left half of s-plane
c) On the imaginary axis
d) At origin
b
7. If the conversion technique is to be effective, the jΩ axis in the s-plane should map into the unit circle in the z-plane.
a) True
b) False
a
8. If the conversion technique is to be effective, then the LHP of s-plane should be mapped into _____________
a) Outside of unit circle
b) Unit circle
c) Inside unit circle
d) Does not matter
c
9. Physically realizable and stable IIR filters cannot have linear phase.
a) True
b) False
a
10. What is the condition on the system function of a linear phase filter?
a) H(z)=\(z^{-N} H(z^{-1})\) 
b) H(z)=\(z^N H(z^{-1})\) 
c) H(z)=\(±z^N H(z^{-1})\) 
d) H(z)=\(±z^{-N} H(z^{-1})\) 
d
H(z)=\(±z^{-N} H(z^{-1})\) 
where z(-N) represents a delay of N units of time.
11. If the filter is in linear phase, then filter would have a mirror-image pole outside the unit circle for every pole inside the unit circle.
a) True
b) False
a
H(z)=\(±z^{-N} H(z^{-1})\) 
where z(-N) represents a delay of N units of time. But if this were the case, the filter would have a mirror image pole outside the unit circle for every pole inside the unit circle. Hence the filter would be unstable.
12. What is the order of operations to be performed in order to realize linear phase IIR filter?

(ii) Time reversing the output of H(z)
(iii) Time reversal of the input signal x(n)
(iv) Passing the result through H(z)
a) (i),(ii),(iii),(iv)
b) (iii),(i),(ii),(iv)
c) (ii),(iii),(iv),(i)
d) (i),(iii),(iv),(ii)
b
13. When an application requires a linear phase filter, it should be an FIR filter.
a) True
b) False
a
