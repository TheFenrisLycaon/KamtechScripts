1. If x(n) is a discrete-time signal, then the value of x(n) at non integer value of ‘n’ is?
a) Zero
b) Positive
c) Negative
d) Not defined
d
2. The discrete time function defined as u(n)=n for n≥0;u(n)=0 for n<0 is an _____________
a) Unit sample signal
b) Unit step signal
c) Unit ramp signal
d) None of the mentioned
c
3. The phase function of a discrete time signal x(n)=an, where a=r.ejθ is?
a) tan(nθ)
b) nθ
c) tan-1(nθ)
d) none of the mentioned
b
=>x(n)=rn.(cosnθ+jsinnθ)
Phase function is tan-1(cosnθ/sinnθ)=tan-1(tan nθ)=nθ. 
4. The signal given by the equation \(\sum_{n=-{\infty}}^{\infty}|x(n)|^2\) is known as __________
a) Energy signal
b) Power signal
c) Work done signal
d) None of the mentioned
a
5. x(n)*δ(n-k)=?
a) x(n)
b) x(k)
c) x(k)*δ(n-k)
d) x(k)*δ(k)
c
6. A real valued signal x(n) is called as anti-symmetric if ___________
a) x(n)=x(-n)
b) x(n)=-x(-n)
c) x(n)=-x(n)
d) none of the mentioned
b
7. The odd part of a signal x(t) is?
a) x(t)+x(-t)
b) x(t)-x(-t)
c) (1/2)*(x(t)+x(-t))
d) (1/2)*(x(t)-x(-t))
d
=>x(-t)=xe(-t)-xo(-t)
By subtracting the above two equations, we get
xo(t)=(1/2)*(x(t)-x(-t)).
8. Time scaling operation is also known as ___________
a) Down-sampling
b) Up-sampling
c) Sampling
d) None of the mentioned
a
9. What is the condition for a signal x(n)=Brn where r=eαT to be called as an decaying exponential signal?
a) 0<r<∞
b) 0<r<1
c) r>1
d) r<0
b
10. The function given by the equation x(n)=1, for n=0; x(n)=0, for n≠0 is a _____________
a) Step function
b) Ramp function
c) Triangular function
d) Impulse function
d
