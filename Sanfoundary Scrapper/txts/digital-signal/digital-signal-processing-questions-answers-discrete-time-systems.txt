1. The output signal when a signal x(n)=(0,1,2,3) is processed through an ‘Identical’ system is?
a) (3,2,1,0)
b) (1,2,3,0)
c) (0,1,2,3)
d) None of the mentioned
c
2. If a signal x(n) is passed through a system to get an output signal of y(n)=x(n+1), then the signal is said to be ____________
a) Delayed
b) Advanced
c) No operation
d) None of the mentioned
d
3. If the output of the system is \(y(n)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^nx(y)\) with an input of x(n) then the system will work as ___________
a) Accumulator
b) Adder
c) Subtractor
d) Multiplier
a
4. What is the output y(n) when a signal x(n)=n*u(n)is passed through a accumulator system under the conditions that it is initially relaxed?
a) \(\frac{n^2+n+1}{2}\) 
b) \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) 
c) \(\frac{n^2+n+2}{2}\) 
d) None of the mentioned
b
According to the equation of the accumulator,
y(n)=\(∑_{k=-∞}^n x(n)\) 
=\(∑_{k=-∞}^{-1} x(n)+∑_{k=0}^n x(n)\) 
=\(y(-1)+ ∑_{k=0}^n n*u(n)\) 
=\(0+∑_{k=0}^n n\)(since u(n)=1 in 0 to n)
=\(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) 
5. The block denoted as follows is known as __________
a) Delay block
b) Advance block
c) Multiplier block
d) Adder block
a
6. The output signal when a signal x(n)=(0,1,2,3) is processed through an ‘Delay’ system is?
a) (3,2,1,0)
b) (1,2,3,0)
c) (0,1,2,3)
d) None of the mentioned
b
7. The system described by the input-output equation y(n)=nx(n)+bx3(n) is a __________
a) Static system
b) Dynamic system
c) Identical system
d) None of the mentioned
a
8. Whether the system described by the input-output equations y(n)=x(n)-x(n-1) a Time-variant system.
a) True
b) False
b
If the output is delayed by k units then y(n-k)=x(n-k)-x((n-k)-1)
=>y(n,k)=y(n-k). Hence the system is time-invariant.
9. The system described by the input-output equations y(n)=x2(n) is a Non-linear system.
a) True
b) False
a
Let y1(n)=x12(n) and y2(n)=x22(n)
y3(n)=y1(n)+y2(n)= x12(n)+ x22(n)≠(x1(n)+x2(n))2
So the system is non-linear.
10. If the output of the system of the system at any ‘n’ depends only the present or the past values of the inputs then the system is said to be __________
a) Linear
b) Non-Linear
c) Causal
d) Non-causal
c
y(n)=F[x(n),x(n-1),x(n-2),…]
So, according to the conditions given in the question, the system is a causal system.
11. The system described by the input-output equations y(n)=x(-n) is a causal system.
a) True
b) False
b
That is, the output of the system at n=-1 is depending on the future value of the input at n=1. So the system is a non-causal system.
12. If a system do not have a bounded output for bounded input, then the system is said to be __________
a) Causal
b) Non-causal
c) Stable
d) Non-stable
d
