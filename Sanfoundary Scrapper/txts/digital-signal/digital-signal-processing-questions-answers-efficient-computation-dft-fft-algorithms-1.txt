X(k)=\(\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n)e^{-j2πkn/N}\) 
From the formula given at every step of computing we are performing N complex multiplications and N-1 complex additions. So, in a total to perform N-point DFT we perform N2 complex multiplications and N(N-1) complex additions.
2. Which of the following is true regarding the number of computations required to compute DFT at any one value of ‘k’?
a) 4N-2 real multiplications and 4N real additions
b) 4N real multiplications and 4N-4 real additions

d) 4N real multiplications and 4N-2 real additions
d
X(k)=\(\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n)e^{-j2πkn/N}\) 
From the formula given at every step of computing we are performing N complex multiplications and N-1 complex additions. So, it requires 4N real multiplications and 4N-2 real additions for any value of ‘k’ to compute DFT of the sequence.

d
XR(k)=\(\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} [x_R (n) cos⁡\frac{2πkn}{N} + x_I (n) sin⁡\frac{2πkn}{N}]\) 
So, from the equation we can tell that the computation of XR(k) requires 2N2 evaluations of trigonometric functions, 4N2 real multiplications and 4N(N-1) real additions.

9. How many complex multiplications are performed in computing the N-point DFT of a sequence using divide-and-conquer method if N=LM?
a) N(L+M+2)
b) N(L+M-2)
c) N(L+M-1)

d
X(p,q)=\(\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}\{W_N^{lq}[\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}x(l,m) W_M^{mq}]\} W_L^{lp}\) 
The first step involves L DFTs, each of M points. Hence this step requires LM2 complex multiplications, second require LM and finally third requires ML2. So, Total complex multiplications = N(L+M+1).
10. How many complex additions are performed in computing the N-point DFT of a sequence using divide-and-conquer method if N=LM?
a) N(L+M+2)
b) N(L+M-2)
c) N(L+M-1)

b
X(p,q)=\(\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}\{W_N^{lq}[\sum_{m=0}^{M-1}x(l,m) W_M^{mq}]\} W_L^{lp}\) 
The first step involves L DFTs, each of M points. Hence this step requires LM(M-1) complex additions, second step do not require any additions and finally third step requires ML(L-1) complex additions. So, Total number of complex additions=N(L+M-2).
