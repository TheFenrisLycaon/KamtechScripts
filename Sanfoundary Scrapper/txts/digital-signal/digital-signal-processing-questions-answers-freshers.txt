1. If we split the N point data sequence into two N/2 point data sequences f1(n) and f2(n) corresponding to the even numbered and odd numbered samples of x(n), then such an FFT algorithm is known as decimation-in-time algorithm.
a) True
b) False
a
f1(n)=x(2n)
f2(n)=x(2n+1), n=0,1,2…N/2-1
Thus f1(n) and f2(n) are obtained by decimating x(n) by a factor of 2, and hence the resulting FFT algorithm is called a decimation-in-time algorithm.
2. If we split the N point data sequence into two N/2 point data sequences f1(n) and f2(n) corresponding to the even numbered and odd numbered samples of x(n) and F1(k) and F2(k) are the N/2 point DFTs of f1(k) and f2(k) respectively, then what is the N/2 point DFT X(k) of x(n)?
a) F1(k)+F2(k)
b) F1(k)-WNk F2(k)
c) F1(k)+WNk F2(k)
d) None of the mentioned
c
f1(n)=x(2n)
f2(n)=x(2n+1), n=0,1,2…N/2-1
X(k)=\(\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) W_N^{kn}\), k=0,1,2..N-1
=\(\sum_{n \,even} x(n) W_N^{kn}+\sum_{n \,odd} x(n) W_N^{kn}\) 
=\(\sum_{m=0}^{(\frac{N}{2})-1} x(2m)W_N^{2km}+\sum_{m=0}^{(\frac{N}{2})-1} x(2m+1) W_N ^{k(2m+1)}\) 
=\(\sum_{m=0}^{(\frac{N}{2})-1} f_1(m) W_{N/2}^{km} + W_N^k \sum_{m=0}^{(N/2)-1} f_2(m) W_{(\frac{N}{2})}^{km}\) 
X(k)=F1(k)+ WNk F2(k).
3. If X(k) is the N/2 point DFT of the sequence x(n), then what is the value of X(k+N/2)?
a) F1(k)+F2(k)
b) F1(k)-WNk F2(k)
c) F1(k)+WNk F2(k)
d) None of the mentioned
b
We know that F1(k) and F2(k) are periodic, with period N/2, we have F1(k+N/2) = F1(k) and F2(k+N/2)= F2(k). In addition, the factor WNk+N/2 = -WNk.
Thus we get, X(k+N/2)= F1(k)- WNk F2(k).
4. How many complex multiplications are required to compute X(k)?
a) N(N+1)
b) N(N-1)/2
c) N2/2
d) N(N+1)/2
