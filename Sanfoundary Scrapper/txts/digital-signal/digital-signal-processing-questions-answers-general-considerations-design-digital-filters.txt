1. The ideal low pass filter cannot be realized in practice.
a) True
b) False
a
2. The following diagram represents the unit sample response of which of the following filters?
a) Ideal high pass filter
b) Ideal low pass filter
c) Ideal high pass filter at ω=π/4
d) Ideal low pass filter at ω=π/4
d
From the given figure, h(0)=0.25=>ω=π/4.
Thus the given figure represents the unit sample response of an ideal low pass filter at ω=π/4.
3. If h(n) has finite energy and h(n)=0 for n<0, then which of the following are true?
a) \(\int_{-π}^π|ln⁡ |H(ω)||dω \gt -\infty\) 
b) \(\int_{-π}^π|ln⁡ |H(ω)||dω \lt \infty\)

d) None of the mentioned
b
\(\int_{-π}^π|ln⁡ |H(ω)||dω \lt \infty\)
4. If |H(ω)| is square integrable and if the integral \(\int_{-\pi}^\pi |ln⁡|H(ω)||dω\) is finite, then the filter with the frequency response H(ω)=|H(ω)|ejθ(ω) is?
a) Anti-causal
b) Constant
c) Causal
d) None of the mentioned
c
5. The magnitude function |H(ω)| can be zero at some frequencies, but it cannot be zero over any finite band of frequencies.
a) True
b) False
a
6. If h(n) is causal and h(n)=he(n)+ho(n),then what is the expression for h(n) in terms of only he(n)?
a) h(n)=2he(n)u(n)+he(0)δ(n), n ≥ 0
b) h(n)=2he(n)u(n)+he(0)δ(n), n ≥ 1
c) h(n)=2he(n)u(n)-he(0)δ(n), n ≥ 1
d) h(n)=2he(n)u(n)-he(0)δ(n), n ≥ 0
d
=>he(n)=1/2[h(n)+h(-n)]
Now, if h(n) is causal, it is possible to recover h(n) from its even part he(n) for 0≤n≤∞ or from its odd component ho(n) for 1≤n≤∞.
=>h(n)= 2he(n)u(n)-he(0)δ(n), n ≥ 0.
7. If h(n) is causal and h(n)=he(n)+ho(n),then what is the expression for h(n) in terms of only ho(n)?
a) h(n)=2ho(n)u(n)+h(0)δ(n), n ≥ 0
b) h(n)=2ho(n)u(n)+h(0)δ(n), n ≥ 1
c) h(n)=2ho(n)u(n)-h(0)δ(n), n ≥ 1
d) h(n)=2ho(n)u(n)-h(0)δ(n), n ≥ 0
b
=>he(n)=1/2[h(n)+h(-n)]
Now, if h(n) is causal, it is possible to recover h(n) from its even part he(n) for 0≤n≤∞ or from its odd component ho(n) for 1≤n≤∞.
=>h(n)= 2ho(n)u(n)+h(0)δ(n), n ≥ 1
since ho(n)=0 for n=0, we cannot recover h(0) from ho(n) and hence we must also know h(0).
8. If h(n) is absolutely summable, i.e., BIBO stable, then the equation for the frequency response H(ω) is given as?
a) HI(ω)-j HR(ω)
b) HR(ω)-j HI(ω)
c) HR(ω)+j HI(ω)
d) HI(ω)+j HR(ω)
c
H(ω)= HR(ω)+j HI(ω)
where HR(ω) and HI(ω) are the Fourier transforms of he(n) and ho(n) respectively.
9. HR(ω) and HI(ω) are interdependent and cannot be specified independently when the system is causal.
a) True
b) False
a
10. What is the Fourier transform of the unit step function U(ω)?
a) πδ(ω)-0.5-j0.5cot(ω/2)
b) πδ(ω)-0.5+j0.5cot(ω/2)
c) πδ(ω)+0.5+j0.5cot(ω/2)
d) πδ(ω)+0.5-j0.5cot(ω/2)
d
U(ω)= πδ(ω)+0.5-j0.5cot(ω/2).
11. The HI(ω) is uniquely determined from HR(ω) through the integral relationship. This integral is called as Continuous Hilbert transform.
a) True
b) False

b) -ωP+ ωS
c) ωP-ωS
d) None of the mentioned
b
