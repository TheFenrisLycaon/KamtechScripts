b) False
a
5. If the phase ϴ(ω) of the system is linear, then the group delay of the system?
a) Increases with frequency of signal
b) Constant
c) Decreases with frequency of signal
d) Independent of frequency of signal
b
Tg(ω)=\(\frac{dϴ(ω)}{dω}\) 
Given the phase is linear=> the group delay of the system is constant.

6. A two pole low pass filter has a system function H(z)=\(\frac{b_0}{(1-pz^{-1})^2}\), What is the value of ‘p’ such that the frequency response H(ω) satisfies the condition |H(π/4)|2=1/2 and H(0)=1?
a) 0.46
b) 0.38
c) 0.32
d) 0.36
c
H(z)=\(\frac{b_0}{(1-pz^{-1})^2}\) and we know that z=rejω. Here in this case r=1. So z=ejω.
Given at ω=0, H(0)=1=>b0=(1-p)2
Given at ω=π/4, |H(π/4)|2=1/2
=>\(\frac{(1-p)^2}{(1-pe^{-jπ/4})^2}\) = 1/2
=>\(\frac{(1-p)^4}{((1-p/\sqrt 2)^2+p^2/2)^2}\) = 1/2
=> √2(1-p)2=1+p2-√2p
Upon solving the above quadratic equation, we get the value of p as 0.32.

H(z)=\(\frac{b_0}{(1-pz^{-1})^2}\) and we know that z=rejω. Here in this case r=1. So z=ejω.
Given at ω=0, H(0)=1=>b0=(1-p)2
Given at ω=π/4, |H(π/4)|2=1/2
=>\(\frac{(1-p)^2}{(1-pe^{-jπ/4})^2}\) = 1/2
=>\(\frac{(1-p)^4}{((1-p/\sqrt 2)^2+p^2/2)^2}\) = 1/2
=> √2(1-p)2=1+p2-√2p
Upon solving the above quadratic equation, we get the value of p as 0.32.
Already we have
b0=(1-p)2=(1-0.32)2
=>b0 = 0.46
8. What is the system function for a two pole band pass filter that has the centre of its pass band at ω=π/2, zero its frequency response characteristic at ω=0 and at ω=π, and its magnitude response is 1/√2 at ω=4π/9?
a) \(0.15\frac{1-z^{-2}}{1+0.7z^{-2}}\) 
b) \(0.15\frac{1+z^{-2}}{1-0.7z^{-2}}\) 
c) \(0.15\frac{1-z^{-2}}{1-0.7z^{-2}}\) 
d) \(0.15\frac{1+z^{-2}}{1+0.7z^{-2}}\) 
a
H(z)=\(G\frac{(z-1)(z+1)}{(z-jr)(z+jr)} = G \frac{(z^2-1)}{(z^2+r^2)}\) 
The gain factor is determined by evaluating the frequency response H(ω) of the filer at ω=π/2. Thus we have,
H(π/2) = \(G \frac{2}{1-r^2} = 1=>G = \frac{1-r^2}{2}\) 
The value of r is determined by evaluating the H(ω) at ω=4π/9. Thus we have
|H(4π/9)|2=\(\frac{(1-r^2)^2}{4}\frac{2-2cos⁡(8π/9)}{1+r^4+2r^2 cos⁡(8π/9)}\)=1/2
On solving the above equation, we get r2=0.7.Therefore the system function for the desired filter is
H(z)=\(0.15\frac{1-z^{-2}}{1+0.7z^{-2}}\)
9. If hlp(n) denotes the impulse response of a low pass filter with frequency response Hlp(ω), then what is the frequency response of the high pass filter in terms of Hlp(ω)?
a) Hlp(ω-π/2)
b) Hlp(ω+π/2)
c) Hlp(ω-π)
d) Hlp(ω+π)
c
hhp(n)=(-1)n hlp(n)=(ejπ)n hlp(n)
Thus the frequency response of the high pass filter is obtained as Hlp(ω-π).
10. If the low pass filter described by the difference equation y(n)=0.9y(n-1)+0.1x(n) is converted into a high pass filter, then what is the frequency response of the high pass filter?

y(n)=-0.9y(n-1)+0.1x(n)
and its frequency response is given as
H(ω)=0.1/(1+0.9e-jω).

a) True
b) False
a
According to the above equation, the second order system with complex conjugate poles on the unit circle is a sinusoid and the system is called a digital sinusoidal oscillator or a Digital frequency synthesizer.
