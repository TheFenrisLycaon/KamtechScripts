b) Subtractive white noise model
c) Additive white noise model
d) None of the mentioned
c
3. How many quantization errors are present in one complex valued multiplication?
a) One
b) Two
c) Three
d) Four
d
4. What is the total number of quantization errors in the computation of single point DFT of a sequence of length N?
a) 2N
b) 4N
c) 8N
d) 12N
b
5. What is the range in which the quantization errors due to rounding off are uniformly distributed as random variables if Δ=2-b?
a) (0,Δ)
b) (-Δ,0)
c) (-Δ/2,Δ/2)
d) None of the mentioned
c
6. The 4N quantization errors are mutually uncorrelated.
a) True
b) False
a
7. The 4N quantization errors are correlated with the sequence {x(n)}.
a) True
b) False
b
8. How is the variance of the quantization error related to the size of the DFT?
a) Equal
b) Inversely proportional
c) Square proportional
d) Proportional
d
The variance of the quantization errors from the 4N multiplications is 4N. 2-2b/12=2-2b(N/3).
Thus the variance of the quantization error is directly proportional to the size of the DFT.
9. Every fourfold increase in the size N of the DFT requires an additional bit in computational precision to offset the additional quantization errors.
a) True
b) False
a
10. What is the variance of the output DFT coefficients |X(k)|?
a) \(\frac{1}{N}\) 
b) \(\frac{1}{2N}\) 
c) \(\frac{1}{3N}\) 
d) \(\frac{1}{4N}\) 
c
Now the variance of the output DFT coefficients |X(k)|=N.\(\frac{1}{3N^2} = \frac{1}{3N}\).
11. What is the signal-to-noise ratio?
a) σX2.σq2
b) σX2/σq2
c) σX2+σq2
d) σX2-σq2
b
12. How many number of bits are required to compute the DFT of a 1024 point sequence with a SNR of 30db?
a) 15
b) 10
c) 5
d) 20
a
10log10(σX22/σq2)=10 log1022b-20
For an SNR of 30db, we have
3(2b-20)=30=>b=15 bits.
Note that 15 bits is the precision for both addition and multiplication.
13. How many number of butterflies are required per output point in FFT algorithm?
a) N
b) N+1
c) 2N
d) N-1
d
14. What is the value of the variance of quantization error in FFT algorithm, compared to that of direct computation?
a) Greater
b) Less
c) Equal
d) Cannot be compared
c
4(N-1)(Δ2/12)=N(Δ2/3)(approximately)
Thus, the variance of quantization error due to FFT algorithm is equal to the variance of the quantization error due to direct computation.
15. How many number of bits are required to compute the FFT of a 1024 point sequence with a SNR of 30db?
a) 11
b) 10
c) 5
d) 20
a
=>3(2b-11)=30
=>b=21/2=11 bits.
