The denominator of H(z) may be expressed in the form
D(z)=\(1+\sum_{k=1}^N a_k z^{-k}=\prod_{k=1}^N (1-p_k z^{-1})\) 
where pk are the poles of H(z).
4. If pk is the set of poles of H(z), then what is Δpk that is the error resulting from the quantization of filter coefficients?
a) Pre-turbation
b) Perturbation
c) Turbation
d) None of the mentioned
b
5. What is the expression for the perturbation error Δpi?
a) \(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{∂p_i}{∂a_k} \Delta a_k\) 
b) \(\sum_{k=1}^N p_i \Delta a_k\) 
c) \(\sum_{k=1}^N \Delta a_k\) 
d) None of the mentioned
a
Δpi=\(\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{∂p_i}{∂a_k} \Delta a_k\) 
Where \(\frac{∂p_i}{∂a_k}\), the partial derivative of pi with respect to ak, represents the incremental change in the pole pi due to a change in the coefficient ak. Thus the total error Δpi is expressed as a sum of the incremental errors due to changes in each of the coefficients ak.

c
\(\frac{∂p_i}{∂a_k}=\frac{-p_i^{N-k}}{\prod_{l=1}^n p_i-p_l}\)

d
H(z)=\(\frac{\sum_{k=0}^M b_k z^{-k}}{1+\sum_{k=1}^N a_k z^{-k}}\) 
The denominator of H(z) may be expressed in the form
D(z)=\(1+\sum_{k=1}^N a_k z^{-k}=\prod_{k=1}^N (1-p_k z^{-1})\) 
where pk are the poles of H(z).
