b) Zeros
c) Solutions
d) None of the mentioned
b
2. What are the values of z for which the value of X(z)=∞?
a) Poles
b) Zeros
c) Solutions
d) None of the mentioned
a
3. If X(z) has M finite zeros and N finite poles, then which of the following condition is true?
a) |N-M| poles at origin(if N>M)
b) |N+M| zeros at origin(if N>M)
c) |N+M| poles at origin(if N>M)
d) |N-M| zeros at origin(if N>M)
d
So, if N>M then z has a positive power. So, it has |N-M| zeros at origin.
4. If X(z) has M finite zeros and N finite poles, then which of the following condition is true?
a) |N-M| poles at origin(if N < M)
b) |N+M| zeros at origin(if N < M)
c) |N+M| poles at origin(if N < M)
d) |N-M| zeros at origin(if N < M)
a
So, if N < M then z has a negative power. So, it has |N-M| poles at origin.
5. Which of the following signals have a pole-zero plot as shown below?
a) a.u(n)
b) u(an)
c) anu(n)
d) none of the mentioned
c
So, we obtain X(z)=z/(z-a)
By applying inverse z-transform for X(z), we get
x(n)= anu(n).
6. Which of the following signals have a pole-zero plot as shown below?(Let M=8 in the figure)
a) 

x(n)=an, 0≤n≤8
    =0, elsewhere
b) 

x(n)=an, 0≤n≤7
    =0, elsewhere
c) 

x(n)=a-n, 0≤n≤8
    =0, elsewhere
d) 

x(n)=a-n, 0≤n≤7
    =0, elsewhere
b
So, X(z) is of the form X(z)=\(\frac{(z-z_1) (z-z_2)……(z-z_8)}{z^7}\) 
By applying inverse z-transform, we get x(n)=an, 0≤n≤7
=0, elsewhere.
  
7. The z-transform X(z) of the signal x(n)=anu(n) has:
a) One pole at z=0 and one zero at z=a
b) One pole at z=0 and one zero at z=0
c) One pole at z=a and one zero at z=a
d) One pole at z=a and one zero at z=0
d
So, it has one pole at z=a and one zero at z=0.
8. What is the nature of the signal whose pole-zero plot is as shown?
a) Rising signal
b) Constant signal
c) Decaying signal
d) None of the mentioned
c
9. What are the values of z for which the value of X(z)=0?
a) Poles
b) Zeros
c) Solutions
d) None of the mentioned
b
10. If Y(z) is the z-transform of the output function, X(z) is the z-transform of the input function and H(z) is the z-transform of system function of the LTI system, then H(z)=?
a) \(\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}\) 
b) \(\frac{X(z)}{Y(z)}\) 
c) Y(z).X(z)
d) None of the mentioned
a
On applying z-transform on both sides we get, Y(z)=H(z).X(z)=>H(z)=\(\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}\). 
11. What is the system function of the system described by the difference equation y(n)=0.5y(n-1)+2x(n)?
a) \(\frac{2}{1+0.5z^{-1}}\) 
b) \(\frac{0.5}{1+2z^{-1}}\) 
c) \(\frac{0.5}{1-2z^{-1}}\) 
d) \(\frac{2}{1-0.5z^{-1}}\) 
d
On applying z-transform on both sides we get, Y(z)=0.5z-1Y(z)+2X(z)
=>\(\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}=\frac{2}{1-0.5z^{-1}}\)=H(z).
12. What is the unit sample response of the system described by the difference equation y(n)=0.5y(n-1)+2x(n)?
a) 0.5(2)nu(n)
b) 2(0.5)nu(n)
c) 0.5(2)nu(-n)
d) 2(0.5)nu(-n)
b
\(\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}=\frac{2}{1-0.5z^{-1}}\)=H(z)
By applying the inverse z-transform we get h(n)=2(0.5)nu(n).
