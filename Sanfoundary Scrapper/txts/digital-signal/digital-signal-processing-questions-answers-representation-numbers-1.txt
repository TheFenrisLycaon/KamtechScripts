1. If (101.01)2=(x)10, then what is the value of x?
a) 505.05
b) 10.101
c) 101.01
d) 5.25
d
=>x=5.25.
2. If X is a real number with ‘r’ as the radix, A is the number of integer digits and B is the number of fraction digits, then X=\(\sum_{i=-A}^B b_i r^{-i}\).
a) True
b) False
a
3. The binary point between the digits b0 and b1 exist physically in the computer.
a) True
b) False
b
4. What is the resolution to cover a range of numbers xmax-xmin with ‘b’ number of bits?
a) (xmax+xmin)/(2b-1)
b) (xmax+xmin)/(2b+1)
c) (xmax-xmin)/(2b-1)
d) (xmax-xmin)/(2b+1)
c
Δ=(xmax-xmin)/(m-1)
where m=2b is the number of levels and ‘b’ is the number of bits.
5. What are the mantissa and exponent required respectively to represent ‘5’ in binary floating point representation?
a) 011,0.110000
b) 0.110000,011
c) 011,0.101000
d) 0.101000,011
d
5=0.625*8=0.625*23
The above number can be represented in binary float point representation as 0.101000*2011
Thus Mantissa=0.101000, Exponent=011.
6. If the two numbers are to be multiplied, the mantissa are multiplied and the exponents are added.
a) True
b) False
a
If we multiply both X and Y, we get X.Y=(M.N).2E+F
Thus if we multiply two numbers, the mantissa are multiplied and the exponents are added.

7. What is the smallest floating point number that can be represented using a 32-bit word?
a) 3*10-38
b) 2*10-38
c) 0.2*10-38
d) 0.3*10-38
d
Thus, the smallest floating point number that can be represented using the 32 bit number is
(1/2)*2-127=0.3*10-38
Thus, the smallest floating point number that can be represented using the 32 bit number is
(1-2-23)*2127=1.7*1038.
8. If 0<E<255, then which of the following statement is true about X?
a) Fractional number
b) Infinity
c) Mixed number
d) Zero
c
From the above equation we can interpret that,
If 0<E<255, then X=(-1)s.2E-127(1.M)=>X is a mixed number.
9. For a twos complement representation, the truncation error is ____________
a) Always positive
b) Always negative
c) Zero
d) None of the mentioned
b
-(2-b-2-bm) ≤ Et ≤ 0.
10. Due to non-uniform resolution, the corresponding error in a floating point representation is proportional to the number being quantized.
a) True
b) False
a
