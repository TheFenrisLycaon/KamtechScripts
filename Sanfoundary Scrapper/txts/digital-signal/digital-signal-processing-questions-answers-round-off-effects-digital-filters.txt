1. The quantization inherent in the finite precision arithmetic operations render the system linear.
a) True
b) False
b
2. In recursive systems, which of the following is caused because of the nonlinearities due to the finite-precision arithmetic operations?
a) Periodic oscillations in the input
b) Non-Periodic oscillations in the input
c) Non-Periodic oscillations in the output
d) Periodic oscillations in the output
d
3. The oscillations in the output of the recursive system are called as ‘limit cycles’.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Limit cycles in the recursive are directly attributable to which of the following?
a) Round-off errors in multiplication
b) Overflow errors in addition
c) Both of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned
c
5. What is the range of values called as to which the amplitudes of the output during a limit cycle ae confined to?
a) Stop band
b) Pass band
c) Live band
d) Dead band
d
6. Zero input limit cycles occur from non-zero initial conditions with the input x(n)=0.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Which of the following is true when the response of the single pole filter is in the limit cycle?
a) Actual non-linear system acts as an equivalent non-linear system
b) Actual non-linear system acts as an equivalent linear system
c) Actual linear system acts as an equivalent non-linear system
d) Actual linear system acts as an equivalent linear system
b
8. Which of the following expressions define the dead band for a single-pole filter?
a) |v(n-1)| ≥ \(\frac{(1/2).2^{-b}}{1+|a|}\) 
b) |v(n-1)| ≥ \(\frac{(1/2).2^{-b}}{1-|a|}\) 
c) |v(n-1)| ≤ \(\frac{(1/2).2^{-b}}{1-|a|}\) 
d) None of the mentioned
c
|Qr[av(n-1)]-av(n-1)| ≤ \((\frac{1}{2}).2^{-b}\) 
Where ‘b’ is the number of bits (exclusive of sign) used in the representation of the pole ‘a’ and v(n). Consequently, we get
|v(n-1)|-|av(n-1)| ≤ \((\frac{1}{2}).2^{-b}\) 
and hence
|v(n-1)| ≤ \(\frac{(\frac{1}{2}).2^{-b}}{1-|a|}\) .
9. What is the dead band of a single pole filter with a pole at 1/2 and represented by 4 bits?
a) (-1/2,1/2)
b) (-1/4,1/4)
c) (-1/8,1/8)
d) (-1/16,1/16)
d
|v(n-1)| ≤ \(\frac{(\frac{1}{2}).2^{-b}}{1-|a|}\) 
Given |a|=1/2 and b=4 => |v(n-1)| ≤ 1/16=> The dead band is (-1/16,1/16).
10. The limit cycle mode with zero input, which occurs as a result of rounding the multiplications, corresponds to an equivalent second order system with poles at z=±1.
a) True
b) False
a
11. What is the necessary and sufficient condition for a second order filter that no zero-input overflow limit cycles occur?
a) |a1|+|a2|=1
b) |a1|+|a2|>1
c) |a1|+|a2|<1
d) None of the mentioned
c
which is extremely restrictive and hence an unreasonable constraint to impose on any second order section.
12. An effective remedy for curing the problem of overflow oscillations is to modify the adder characteristic.
a) True
b) False
a
13. What is the dead band of a single pole filter with a pole at 3/4 and represented by 4 bits?
a) (-1/2,1/2)
b) (-1/8,1/8)
c) (-1/4,1/4)
d) (-1/16,1/16)
b
|v(n-1)| ≤ \(\frac{(\frac{1}{2}).2^{-b}}{1-|a|}\) 
Given |a|=3/4 and b=4 => |v(n-1)| ≤ 1/8=> The dead band is (-1/8,1/8).
