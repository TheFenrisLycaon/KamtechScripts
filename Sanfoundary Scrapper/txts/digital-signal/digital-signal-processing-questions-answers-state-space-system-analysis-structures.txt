1. The state space or the internal description of the system still involves a relationship between the input and output signals, what are the additional set of variables it also involves?
a) System variables
b) Location variables
c) State variables
d) None of the mentioned
c
2. State variables provide information about all the internal signals in the system.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Which of the following gives the complete definition of the state of a system at time n0?
a) Amount of information at n0 determines output signal for n≥n0
b) Input signal x(n) for n≥n0 determines output signal for n≥n0
c) Input signal x(n) for n≥0 determines output signal for n≥n0
d) Amount of information at n0+input signal x(n) for n≥n0 determines output signal for n≥n0
d
4. From the definition of state of a system, the system consists of only one component called memory less component.
a) True
b) False
b
5. If we interchange the rows and columns of the matrix F, then the system is called as ______________
a) Identity system
b) Diagonal system
c) Transposed system
d) None of the mentioned
c
6. A single input-single output system and its transpose have identical impulse responses and hence the same input-output relationship.
a) True
b) False
a
7. A closed form solution of the state space equations is easily obtained when the system matrix F is?
a) Transpose
b) Symmetric
c) Identity
d) Diagonal
d
8. What is the condition to call a number λ is an Eigen value of F and a nonzero vector U is the associated Eigen vector?
a) (F+λI)U=0
b) (F-λI)U=0
c) F-λI=0
d) None of the mentioned
b
FU=λU
Thus, we obtain (F-λI)U=0.
9. The determinant |F-λI|=0 yields the characteristic polynomial of the matrix F.
a) True
b) False
a
The above equation has a nonzero solution U if the matrix F-λI is singular, which is the case if the determinant of (F-λI) is zero. That is, |F-λI|=0.
This determinant yields the characteristic polynomial of the matrix F.
10. The parallel form realization is also known as normal form representation.
a) True
b) False
a
