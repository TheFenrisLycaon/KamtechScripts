We view this FIR realization as a cascade of two filters, H(z)=H1(z).H2(z)
Here H1(z) represents the all-zero filter or comb filter, and the system function of the other filter is given by the equation
H2(z)=\(\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \frac{H(k+α)}{1-e^{\frac{j2π(k+α)}{M}} z^{-1}}\)

a) ej2π(k+α)M
b) ej2π(k+α)/M
c) ej2π(k-α)/M
d) ejπ(k+α)/M
b
H2(z)=\(\sum_{k=0}^{M-1} \frac{H(k+α)}{1-e^{\frac{j2π(k+α)}{M}} z^{-1}}\) 
We obtain the poles of the above system function by equating the denominator of the above equation to zero.

The above system function can be represented in the cascade form as shown in the above block diagram.
