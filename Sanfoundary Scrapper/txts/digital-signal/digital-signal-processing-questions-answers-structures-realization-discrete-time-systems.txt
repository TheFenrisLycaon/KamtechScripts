1. The general linear constant coefficient difference equation characterizing an LTI discrete time system is?
a) y(n)=-\(\sum_{k=1}^N a_k y(n-k)+\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n-k)\) 
b) y(n)=-\(\sum_{k=0}^N a_k y(n-k)+\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n-k) \) 
c) y(n)=-\(\sum_{k=1}^N a_k y(n)+\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n) \) 
d) None of the mentioned
a
y(n)=-\(\sum_{k=1}^N a_k y(n-k)+\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n-k)\)
2. Which of the following is the rational system function of an LTI system characterized by the difference equation y(n)=-\(\sum_{k=1}^N a_k y(n-k)+\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n-k)\)?
a) \(\frac{\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n-k)}{1+\sum_{k=0}^N a_k y(n-k)}\) 
b) \(\frac{1+\sum_{k=1}^N a_k y(n-k)}{\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n-k)}\) 
c) \(\frac{\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n-k)}{1+\sum_{k=1}^N a_k y(n-k)}\) 
d) \(\frac{1+\sum_{k=0}^N a_k y(n-k)}{\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n-k)}\) 
c
y(n)=-\(\sum_{k=1}^N a_k y(n-k)+\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n-k)\) 
By applying the z-transform on both sides of the above equation and by rearranging the obtained equation, we get the rational system function as H(z)=\(\frac{\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n-k)}{1+\sum_{k=1}^N a_k y(n-k)}\)
3. We can view y(n)=-\(\sum_{k=1}^N a_k y(n-k)+\sum_{k=0}^N b_k x(n-k)\) as the computational procedure (an algorithm) for determining the output sequence y(n) of the system from the input sequence x(n).
