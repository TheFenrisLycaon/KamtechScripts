1. By impulse invariance method, the IIR filter will have a unit sample response h(n) that is the sampled version of the analog filter.
a) True
b) False
a
h(n)=h(nT); n=0,1,2…
where T is the sampling interval.
2. If a continuous time signal x(t) with spectrum X(F) is sampled at a rate Fs=1/T samples per second, the spectrum of the sampled signal is _____________
a) Non periodic repetition
b) Non periodic non-repetition
c) Periodic repetition
d) None of the mentioned
c
3. If a continuous time signal x(t) with spectrum X(F) is sampled at a rate Fs=1/T samples per second, then what is the scaled spectrum?
a) X(F)
b) Fs.X(F)
c) X(F)/Fs
d) None of the mentioned
b
4. When σ=0, then what is the condition on ‘r’?
a) 0<r<1
b) r=1
c) r>1
d) None of the mentioned
b
Now substitute s=σ+jΩ and z=r.ejω, that is represent ‘z’ in the polar form
On equating both sides, we get
r=eσT
Thus when σ=0, the value of ‘r’ varies from r=1.
5. What is the equation for normalized frequency?
a) F/Fs
b) F.Fs
c) Fs/F
d) None of the mentioned
a
f= F/Fs.

6. Aliasing occurs if the sampling rate Fs is more than twice the highest frequency contained in X(F).
a) True
b) False
b
7. Which of the filters have a frequency response as shown in the figure below?
a) Analog filter
b) Digital filter without aliasing
c) Digital filter with aliasing
d) None of the mentioned
c
8. The frequency response given in the above question is for a low pass digital filter.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Sampling interval T is selected sufficiently large to completely avoid or at least minimize the effects of aliasing.
a) True
b) False
b
10. Which of the following filters cannot be designed using impulse invariance method?
a) Low pass
b) Band pass
c) Low and band pass
d) High pass
d
11. Which of the following is the correct relation between ω and Ω?
a) Ω=ωT
b) T=Ωω
c) ω=ΩT
d) None of the mentioned
c
Now substitute s=σ+jΩ and z=r.ejω, that is represent ‘z’ in the polar form
On equating both sides, we get
ω=ΩT.
12. When σ<0, then what is the condition on ‘r’?
a) 0<r<1
b) r=1
c) r>1
d) None of the mentioned
a
Now substitute s=σ+jΩ and z=r.ejω, that is represent ‘z’ in the polar form
On equating both sides, we get
r=eσT
Thus when σ<0, the value of ‘r’ varies from 0<r<1.
13. When σ>0, then what is the condition on ‘r’?
a) 0<r<1
b) r=1
c) r>1
d) None of the mentioned
c
Now substitute s=σ+jΩ and z=r.ejω, that is represent ‘z’ in the polar form
On equating both sides, we get
r=eσT
Thus when σ>0, the value of ‘r’ varies from r>1.
14. What is the period of the scaled spectrum Fs.X(F)?
a) 2Fs
b) Fs/2
c) 4Fs
d) Fs
