1. An analog filter can be converted into digital filter by approximating the differential equation by an equivalent difference equation.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Which of the following is the backward difference for the derivative of y(t) with respect to ‘t’ for t=nT?
a) [y(n)+y(n+1)]/T
b) [y(n)+y(n-1)]/T
c) [y(n)-y(n+1)]/T
d) [y(n)-y(n-1)]/T
d
dy(t)/dt =[y(nT)-y(nT-T)]/T
=[y(n)-y(n-1)]/T
where T represents the sampling interval and y(n)=y(nT).
3. Which of the following is true relation among s-domain and z-domain?
a) s=(1+z-1)/T
b) s=(1+z )/T
c) s=(1-z-1)/T
d) None of the mentioned
c
s=(1-z-1)/T.
4. What is the second difference that is used to replace the second order derivate of y(t)?
a) [y(n)-2y(n-1)+y(n-2)]/T
b) [y(n)-2y(n-1)+y(n-2)]/T2
c) [y(n)+2y(n-1)+y(n-2)]/T
d) [y(n)+2y(n-1)+y(n-2)]/T2
b
Second order derivative of y(t) is d(dy(t)/dt)/dt=[y(n)-2y(n-1)+y(n-2)]/T2.
5. Which of the following in z-domain is equal to s-domain of second order derivate?
a) \((\frac{1-z^{-1}}{T})^2\) 
b) \((\frac{1+z^{-1}}{T})^2\) 
c) \((\frac{1+z^{-1}}{T})^{-2}\) 
d) None of the mentioned
a
d2y(t)/dt2=[y(n)-2y(n-1)+y(n-2)]/T2
=>s2 = \(\frac{1-2z^{-1}+z^{-2}}{T^2} = (\frac{1-z^{-1}}{T})^2\)  
6. If s=jΩ and if Ω varies from -∞ to ∞, then what is the corresponding locus of points in z-plane?
a) Circle of radius 1 with centre at z=0
b) Circle of radius 1 with centre at z=1
c) Circle of radius 1/2 with centre at z=1/2
d) Circle of radius 1 with centre at z=1/2
c
s=(1-z-1)/T
=> z=1/(1-sT)
Given s= jΩ => z = 1/(1- jΩT)
Thus from the above equation if Ω varies from -∞ to ∞, then the corresponding locus of points in z-plane is a circle of radius 1/2 with centre at z=1/2.
7. Which of the following mapping is true between s-plane and z-domain?
a) Points in LHP of the s-plane into points inside the circle in z-domain
b) Points in RHP of the s-plane into points outside the circle in z-domain
c) Points on imaginary axis of the s-plane into points onto the circle in z-domain
d) All of the mentioned
d
8. This mapping is restricted to the design of low pass filters and band pass filters having relatively small resonant frequencies.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Which of the following filter transformation is not possible?
a) High pass analog filter to low pass digital filter
b) High pass analog filter to high pass digital filter
c) Low pass analog filter to low pass digital filter
d) None of the mentioned
b
10. It is possible to map the jΩ-axis into the unit circle.
a) True
b) False
a
