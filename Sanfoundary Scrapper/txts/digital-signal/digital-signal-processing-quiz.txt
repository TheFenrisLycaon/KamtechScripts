1. What is the value of |TN(&pm;1)|?
a) 0
b) -1
c) 1
d) None of the mentioned
c
TN(x) = cos(Ncos-1x), |x|≤1
cosh(Ncosh-1x), |x|>1
Thus |TN(&pm;1)|=1.
2. The chebyshev polynomial is oscillatory in the range |x|<∞.
a) True
b) False
b
3. If NB and NC are the orders of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters respectively to meet the same frequency specifications, then which of the following relation is true?
a) NC=NB
b) NC<NB
c) NC>NB
d) Cannot be determined
b
4. The chebyshev-I filter is equi-ripple in pass band and monotonic in the stop band.
a) True
b) False
a
5. What is the equation for magnitude frequency response |H(jΩ)| of a low pass chebyshev-I filter?
a) \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-ϵ T_N^2 (\frac{Ω}{Ω_P})}}\) 
b) \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+ϵ T_N^2 (\frac{Ω}{Ω_P})}}\) 
c) \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-ϵ^2 T_N^2 (\frac{Ω}{Ω_P})}}\) 
d) \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+ϵ^2 T_N^2 (\frac{Ω}{Ω_P})}}\) 
d
|H(jΩ)|=\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+ϵ^2 T_N^2(\frac{Ω}{Ω_P})}}\) 
where ϵ is a parameter of the filter related to the ripple in the pass band and TN(x) is the Nth order chebyshev polynomial.
6. What is the number of minima’s present in the pass band of magnitude frequency response of a low pass chebyshev-I filter of order 4?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
7. What is the number of maxima present in the pass band of magnitude frequency response of a low pass chebyshev-I filter of order 5?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
c
8. The sum of number of maxima and minima in the pass band equals the order of the filter.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Which of the following is the characteristic equation of a Chebyshev filter?
a) 1+ϵ2TN2(s/j)=0
b) 1-ϵ2TN2(s/j)=0
c) 1+ϵ TN2(s/j)=0
d) None of the mentioned
a
|H(jΩ)|=\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+ϵ^2 T_N^2(\frac{Ω}{Ω_P})}}\) 
=>|H(jΩ)|2=\(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+ϵ^2 T_N^2(\frac{Ω}{Ω_P})}}\) 
By replacing jΩ by s and consequently Ω by s/j in the above equation, we get
=>|HN(s)|2=\(\frac{1}{1+ϵ^2 T_N^2 (s/j)}\) 
The poles of the above equation is given by the equation 1+ϵ2TN2(s/j)=0 which is called as the characteristic equation.
10. The poles of HN(s).HN(-s) are found to lie on ___________
a) Circle
b) Parabola
c) Hyperbola
d) Ellipse
d
The roots of the above characteristic equation lies on ellipse, thus the poles of HN(s).HN(-s) are found to lie on ellipse.
11. If the discrimination factor ‘d’ and the selectivity factor ‘k’ of a chebyshev I filter are 0.077 and 0.769 respectively, then what is the order of the filter?
a) 2
b) 5
c) 4
d) 3
b
N=cosh-1(1/d)/cosh-1(1/k)=4.3
Rounding off to the next large integer, we get N=5.
