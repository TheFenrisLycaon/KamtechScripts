We know that KP=-1 dB, ΩP=4 rad/sec and N=5
Upon substituting the values in the above equation, we get
ΩC=4.5787 rad/sec.

We know that for a 5th order normalized low pass Butterworth filter, system equation is given as
H5(s)=\(\frac{1}{(s+1)(s^2+0.618s+1)(s^2+1.618s+1)}\) 
The specified low pass filter is obtained by applying low pass-to-low pass transformation on the normalized low pass filter.
That is, Ha(s)=H5(s)|s→s/Ωc
=H5(s)|s→s/4.5787
upon calculating, we get
Ha(s)=\({2012.4}{s^5+14.82s^4+109.8s^3+502.6s^2+1422.3s+2012.4}\) 
3. If H(s)=\(\frac{1}{s^2+s+1}\) represent the transfer function of a low pass filter (not Butterworth) with a pass band of 1 rad/sec, then what is the system function of a low pass filter with a pass band 10 rad/sec?

=\(\frac{s^2}{s^2+10s+100}\)
6. If H(s)=\(\frac{1}{s^2+s+1}\) represent the transfer function of a low pass filter (not Butterworth) with a pass band of 1 rad/sec, then what is the system function of a band pass filter with a pass band of 10 rad/sec and a center frequency of 100 rad/sec?
a) \(\frac{s^2}{s^4+10s^3+20100s^2+10^5 s+1}\) 
b) \(\frac{100s^2}{s^4+10s^3+20100s^2+10^5 s+1}\) 
c) \(\frac{s^2}{s^4+10s^3+20100s^2+10^5 s+10^8}\) 
d) \(\frac{100s^2}{s^4+10s^3+20100s^2+10^5 s+10^8}\) 
d
\(s\rightarrow\frac{s^2+\Omega_u \Omega_l}{s(\Omega_u-\Omega_l)}\) 
Thus the required band pass filter has a transform function as
Ha(s)=\(\frac{100s^2}{s^4+10s^3+20100s^2+10^5 s+10^8}\).
7. If H(s)=\(\frac{1}{s^2+s+1}\) represent the transfer function of a low pass filter (not Butterworth) with a pass band of 1 rad/sec, then what is the system function of a stop band filter with a stop band of 2 rad/sec and a center frequency of 10 rad/sec?
a) \(\frac{(s^2+100)^2}{s^4+2s^3+204s^2+200s+10^4}\)

Ωu=2π*20*103=1.257*105 rad/sec
Ωl=2π*50=314.159 rad/sec
We know that

Ωu=2π*20*103=1.257*105 rad/sec
Ωl=2π*50=314.159 rad/sec
We know that
A=\(\frac{-Ω_1^2+Ω_u Ω_l}{Ω_1 (Ω_u-Ω_l)}\) and B=\(\frac{Ω_2^2-Ω_u Ω_l}{Ω_2 (Ω_u-Ω_l)}\) 
=> A=2.51 and B=2.25
Hence ΩS=Min{|A|,|B|}=> ΩS=2.25 rad/sec.
The order N of the normalized low pass Butterworth filter is computed as follows
N=\(\frac{log⁡[(10^{-K_P/10}-1)(10^{-K_s/10}-1)]}{2 log⁡(\frac{1}{Ω_S})}\)=2.83
