1. The overall Material balance, is given as
a) F = D+B
b) D =F +B
c)  F = D+B
d)  F=B-D
a
D=Distillates
B= Bottoms moles.
2. The material Balance around a condenser, is given as
a) F = D+B
b) F = D+B
c) V = L+D
d) L= V + D
c
V= Vapor from column
L= liquid returning to column.
3. For a batch distillation process
a) –ydV = d(xW)
b) –xdV = d(xW)
c)  -xW =d(yV)
d)- yW =d(xV)
a
W=total moles in still.
4) The below equation, holds well for?
a) Flash distillation
b)  Simple distillation
c)  Multicomponent distillation
d)  Final distillation
b
5. If the integral part is given as -1.79 and still has 100 moles originally charged. Find the WF?
a) 15.8
b) 12.9
c) 16.7
d) 18.0
c
So WF = 16.7.
6. Find α. If Xd=0.517 and Xw=0.3
a)  1.3
b) 2.5
c) 5.6
d) 3.4
b

a) 7.8
b) 10
c) 9
d) 1.34
b
8. Calculate the enthalpy HF? If Cp= 0.825, W=32 and Tref=15C, at room temperature
a) 119 kcal/kmol
b) 78 kcal/kmol
c) 700 kcal/kmol
d) 70 kcal/kmol
a
9. Batch distillation is also called as?
a) Flash distillation
b)  Rayleigh’s Criteria
c)  Thompson Distillation
d)  Crane Distillation
b
10) Flash distillation is called as?
A)  Final distillation
B) Equilibrium distillation
C) Growth distillation
D)  Full distillation
b
