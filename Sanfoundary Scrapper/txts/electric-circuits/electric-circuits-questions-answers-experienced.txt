a) A node
b) A mesh
c) A branch
d) A super mesh
b
2. If there are 6 branches and 4 essential nodes, how many equations are required to describe a circuit in mesh-current method?
a) 3
b) 6
c) 4
d) 2
a
3. Find the current flowing through 5Ω resistor in the given circuit.
a) 0.57A
b) 0.64A
c) 0.78A
d) 0.89A
c
4. A Super Mesh analysis could be done when there is a common _____________ between any two loops.
a) Voltage source
b) Current source
c) Resistor
d) Both voltage and current source
b
5. Calculate the current flowing through 10Ω resistor in the circuit shown below.
a) ±0.435A
b) ±0.985A
c) 1.217A
d) 2.782A
a
		Supermesh: I3-I2=4
                          Loop1: 11I1-10I2=2
		KVL at Supermesh: -2I1+3I2+3I3=0
Solving these gives the currents flowing in the circuit and current through 10Ω resistor is either I1-I2 or I2-I1.
6. Find the power delivered by the voltage source in the network given below.
a) 65Watts
b) 72Watts
c) 63Watts
