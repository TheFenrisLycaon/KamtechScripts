d
                        V2 = 10(2)
                        V2 = I.R2
                          = 2(2)
                          4V.

a)  -1A
b) +2A
c) 8A
d) -5A
b
                         = 2A.
6. For a parallel connected resistor R1, R2 and a voltage of V volts. Current across the first resistor is given by
a) I R1
b) I R2
c) I R1 / R1 + R2
d) I R2 / R1 + R2
d
   R = R1. R2 / R1  + R2
     = I .    R1. R2 / R1 . R1 + R2
   I1 = I R2 / R1 + R2. 
7.  R1 = 1Ω, R2 = 3Ω, R3 = 5Ω and R4 = 7Ω connected in series. Total voltage = 20V, Current I, V2 =?
a) I = 1.23, V2 = 3.75
b) I = 1.25, V2 = 3.75
c) I = 1.15, V2= 3.73
d) I = 1.16, V2 = 3.72
b
    V2 = V. R2 / R1 + R2 + R3 + R4
     = 20(3)/16
   = 3.75V.
8. R1 = 1Ω, R2 = 3Ω, R3 = 5Ω and R4 = 7Ω connected in parallel. Total Current = 23A. Then V, I1 , I2  =?
a) 12.26v, 1.725, 2.875
b) 12.23v, 2.875, 1.725
c) 11.26v, 1.95, 1.74
d) 11.23v, 1.74, 1.95
a
        V = I (R1  + R2) R1  R2  = 12.26v
         I1 = IR2/ R1  + R2 = 1.725A
        I2   = IR1/ R1  + R2
         = 2.875A.
