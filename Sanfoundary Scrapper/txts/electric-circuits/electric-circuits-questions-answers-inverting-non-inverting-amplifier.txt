b) vo= 6vg
c) vo= 3vg
d) vo= vg
c
9. If Rs= 5Ω, Rf= 25Ω and -2.5V ≤ vg ≤ 2.5V. What are the smallest power supply voltages that could be applied and still have opamp in linear region?
a) ±9V
b) ±2.5V
c) ±6V
d) ±15V
d
                           vo=6(-2.5) = -15
                           vo=6(2.5) =15.
10.  If an inverting amplifying circuit has a gain of 10 and ±15V power supplies are used. The values of input for which opamp would be in the linear region?
a) ±1.25
b) ±1.5V
c) ±2.25
d) ±0.5
b
→ vo= -10vs and given -12V≤ vo ≤ 12V.
→ -15= -10vs. So, vs= 1.5V
→ 15=-10vs. So, vs=-1.5V.
11. If the gain of an  inverting amplifying circuit is 13 and ±22V power supplies are used. What range of input values allows the opamp to be in linear region?
a) ±1.69
b) ±1.35V
c) ±2.28
d) ±0.5
a
→ vo= -13vs and given -22V≤ vo ≤ 22V.
→ -22= -13vs. So, vs=1.692 V
→ 22=-13vs. So, vs=-1.692V.
12. The input applied to an Inverting amplifier is ______________
a) Equal to output
b) Equal to Inverted output
c) Not equal to output
d) Output is equal to input
b
13. In R1=10kΩ, Rf=100kΩ, v1=1V. A load of 25kΩ is connected to the output terminal. Calculate i1 and vo.
a) 0.5mA, 10V
b) 0.1mA, 10V
c) 0.1mA, -10V
d) 0.5mA, -10V
c
                      V0= -(Rf/R1)*v1 = -(100kΩ/10kΩ)*1V = -10V.
