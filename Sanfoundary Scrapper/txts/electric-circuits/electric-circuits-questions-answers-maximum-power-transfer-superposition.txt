b) 1025W
c) 2025W
d) 1500W
c
		VTh= (150/150+30)*540= 450V
		RTh=(150*30)/180= 25Ω (the given resistors are in parallel).
5. Determine the maximum power delivered to the load in the network given.
a) 4.68W
b) 5.75W
c) 3.16W
d) 6.84W
a
RTh=RL= 10Ω//5Ω and in series with 2Ω and then parallel with 3Ω=1.92Ω
Max power = (VTh) 2 /4RL = 4.688W.

                        2. When 5A source acting alone: 20v source is replaced by a short circuit. By current division rule, I3= 25/8=3.125A
   Total current through I3= 2.5+3.125=5.625A.
9. Find the current in 5Ω resistor near 12V source using superposition principle in network given
