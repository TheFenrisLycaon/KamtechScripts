1. ____________ helps in current measurement by placing it in ____________ with the circuit element.
a) Voltameter, Parallel
b)  Ammeter, series
c)  Voltmeter, series
d)  Ammeter, parallel
b
2. An ideal voltmeter has ___________ equivalent resistance and ideal ammeter has ___________ equivalent resistance.
a)  Unity, Unity
b)  Zero, infinite
c)  Infinite, Zero
d)  Zero, Zero
c
3. Continuous voltages (or) current signals are measured using
a)  Tachometers
b)  Sonometers
c)  Analog meters
d)  Digital meters
d
4. Digital meters are preferable than analog meters.
a) True
b) False
a
5. A 20mv, 1mA d’Arsonval movement is used in an ammeter whose full-scale reading is 10 mA. Determine RA.
a) 2.222Ω
b) 6.667Ω
c) 5.92Ω
d) 3.333Ω
a
 1 mA flowing through coil implies that 9mA must be diverted through RA.
          V = ir
      20 * 10-3 = 9 * 10-3 RA
      RA= 2.222Ω.
6. A 25mv, 2mA d’Arsonval movement is to be used in voltmeter whose full scale reading is 100v. The resistance inserted by 100v meter into circuit is ___________
a) 1 * 105Ω
b) 1 * 106Ω
c) 1 * 104Ω
d) 1 * 103Ω
a
                               R = v/i
                                  = 100/1mA
                                  = 100,000Ω.
7. An ideal voltmeter functions as __________ circuit
a) A short
 b) An open
c) A power
d) An infinite
b
8. An ideal ammeter functions as __________ circuit
a) A short
b) An open
c) A power
d) An infinite
a
9. A 100mv, 5mA d’Arsonval movement is to be used in an ammeter whose full-scale reading is 1A. Calculate RA.
a) 0.7 ohms
b) 0.5 ohms
c) 0.1 ohms
d) 0.2 ohms
c
                                  V = iR
                                     = 100 * 10-3
                                     = 995 * 10-3 RA
                                 RA  = 0.100Ω.
10. A 122mv, 12mA d’Arsonval movement is to be used in voltmeter whose full scale reading is 120v. The resistance inserted by 120v _____________
a) 1200Ω
b) 12000Ω
c) 1000Ω
d) 10,000Ω
d
                            = 10,000Ω.
