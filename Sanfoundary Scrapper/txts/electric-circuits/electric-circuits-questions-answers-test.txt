1. Op-amp was introduced by __________
a) Fairchild
b) Maxwell
c) Rutherford
d) Sahani
a
2. The number of terminals in an Op-amp ______________
a) 6
b) 2
c) 5
d) 3
c
3. The Op-amp is a type of ___________
a) Differential amplifier
b) Integrated amplifier
c) Isolation amplifier
d) Feedback amplifier
a
4. In the circuit of Op-amp given V- stands for _________
a) Non-inverting input
b) Non-inverting output
c) Inverting input
d) Inverting output
c
5. When the input voltage difference is small in magnitude, the Op-amp behaves as ____________
a) Non-linear device
b) Linear device
c) Complex device
d) Bipolar device
b
6. If the output voltage is not a linear function of input voltage then ____________
a) Op-amp acts a linear device
b) Op-amp acts as a non-linear device
c) Op-amp acts a polar device
d) Op-amp acts as an inverter
b
7. The negative feedback causes the input voltage difference to ____________
a) 1
b) Increase
c) Decrease
d) 0
c
8.  Find the gain for the following circuit.
a) -2
b) 2
c) -1
d) 1
a
9. Calculate the gain for the Op-amp given.
a) 0.719
b) 2.572
c) 1.390
d) 1.237
c
10. Given Op-amp is ideal. Calculate vo if va=1v and vb=0v.
a) -4v
b) -2.5v
c) 4v
d) 2.5v
b
 i50= (va-vn)/50 =1/50 mA.
 I125= (v0-vn)/125 = v0/125 mA.
 1/50 + v0/125 = 0.
v0 is -2.5volts.
