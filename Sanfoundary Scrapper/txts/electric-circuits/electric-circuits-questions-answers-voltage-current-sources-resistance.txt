b) Dependent sources
c) Ideal sources
d) Voltage sources
a
3.
       I3 = α vx  .This is
a) Voltage control voltage source
b) Current control voltage source
c) Voltage control current source
d) Current control current source
b
                      Controlled voltage is vx.
4. Inductor is _______________ element.
a) Active
b) Passive
c) Linear
d) Polar
b
5.
         Which of the above is valid?
a) 1
b) 2
c) Both
d) Neither 1 nor 2
a
6.
      The above circuit is valid.
a)  False
b)  True
b
7. The opposing capacity of materials against the current flow is
a) Conductance
b) Inductance
c) Susceptance
d) Resistance
d
8. The conductance of a 923Ω resistance is
a) 1.08 * 10-3 mho
b) 1.08 * 10-4 mho
c) 1.02 * 10-3 mho
d) 1.02 * 10-4 mho
a
9. The current passing through a circuit is 7.2A and the power at the terminals is 27 watts.
       Existence is ___________ ohms.
a)  0.5402
b) 0.5208
c) 0.5972
d) 0.5792
b
                             = (iR) i
                             = i2 R
                          R = P/i2
                                          =27/ (7.2)2
                                      = 0.5208Ω.
10. Relation between power, voltage and conductance
a)  V = P2.G
b)  V = P2/G
c)  P = v2/G
d)  P = V2 G
d
                            = v (v/R)
                            = v2/R
                            = v2G.
