1. In a transformer if the frequency of the supply is varied then the magnetizing current in the core also varies.
a) True
b) False
b
2. CRGO Laminations in a transformer are used to minimize __________
a) eddy current loss
b) hysteresis loss
c) both eddy current and hysteresis loss
d) ohmic loss
c
3. A single phase transformer has emf per turn having 2310/220 V, 50Hz transformer as 13 V. Then the estimated primary turns will be?
a) 189 turns
b) 179 turns
c) 176 turns
d) 190 turns
a
               = 220/13 = 16.92 = 17(approx)
               For N2 = 17, N1 = 178.5. But it is not an integer, so this approximation is wrong.
               If N2 = 18, N1=189 turns.
4. A single phase transformer has emf per turn having 2310/220 V, 50Hz transformer as 13 V. The core area is(in square cm)?
