d
15. A 6-pole lap wound DC generator has a developed power of P watts and brush voltage of E volts. Three adjacent brushes of the machine had been found worn out and got open circuited. If the machine is operated with the remaining brushes, voltage and power that could be obtained from the machine are _________
a) E, P
b) E, 2P/3
c) E/P, 2P/3
d) E, P/3
a
             But the current will reduce in the overall winding as the resistance has increased, so power will decrease by 1/3.
16. Consider a dc machine having its armature wound in lap fashion having 12 coils and each resistance 0.1 ohms. If it is measured resistance between two adjacent commutator segments, the result will be _________
a) 0.092 ohms

c) 1.8 ohms
d) 0.92 ohms
a
			 R(eq) = 0.1||1.1 = 0.0917.
