c) remains same
d) doubles
a
2. If the speed of rotation for a four pole, 220V dc machine is 1 m/s, flux density as 2T having length of bore as 0.1m and radius of 0.5m. The emf induced under pole faces will be ________

b) 0.1 V
c) 0.2*pi V
d) 220 V
a
               = 2*0.1*1
	       = 0.2 Volts.

c) the induced emf halves
d) none of the mentioned
a
5. For a four pole, 16 slot armature with two coil-side/slot having lap connected progressive winding has single turn coils. The same machine is then wave wound, the emf induced in the lap wound dc machine to that of wave wound will be ________
a) 2
b) 0.5
c) 1
d) 4
b
              = 1/(4/2) = 1/2 V.
