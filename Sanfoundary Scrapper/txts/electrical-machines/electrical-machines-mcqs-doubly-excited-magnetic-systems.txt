9. Which of the following statements are true about electromagnetic torques and reluctance torques?

(i) electromagnetic torque can exist only if both windings carry current
(ii) reluctance torque depend on the direction of current in stator or rotor windings
(iii) reluctance torque doesn't depend on the direction of current in stator or rotor windings
(iv) electromagnetic torque depend on the direction of currents is and ir
(v) electromagnetic torque doesn't depend on the direction of currents is and ir
a) (i), (ii), (iii)
b) (ii), (iii), (v)
c) (i), (iii), (iv)
d) (ii), (iii), (iv)
c
Positive or negative value of current doesn’t affect the torque direction. The interaction/electromagnetic torque = isirdMsr/dθr, here the direction of is and ir changes the torque.
