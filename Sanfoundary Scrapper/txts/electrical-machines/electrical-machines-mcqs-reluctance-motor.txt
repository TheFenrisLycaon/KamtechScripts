6. Reluctance motor can produce torque at ________
a) any speed less than synchronous speed
b) synchronous speed only
c) any speed greater than synchronous speed
d) all of the mentioned
b
if wr≠w then Te(av)=0, and  if wr=w then Te(av)≠0, as the last term in the equation 1/2 sin⁡(-2δ) does not vary with time, and  hence average torque is not equal to zero.

b) 90°
c) 0°
d) 180°
a
