1. For a toroid to extract the energy from the supply system, the flux linkages of the magnetic field must be ________
a) zero
b) changing or varying
c) constant
d) any of the mentioned
b
2. Magnetic stored energy density for iron is given by ______
a) 1/2 B/μ
b) 1/2 B2 μ
c) 1/2 ∅2 Rl
d) 1/2 B2/μ
d
wfld=Wfld/((Length of the magnetic path through Iron)*(Iron area normal to the magnetic flux))=1/2  (F∅)/(length*Area)=1/2  F/length  ∅/area=1/2  H*B
Also, H = B/μ,thus wfld=1/2  B2/μ.
3. The energy stored in a magnetic field is given by ____________ where L=self-inductance and Rl=reluctance.
a) 1/2 Li2
b) 1/2 (mmf*Rl)2
c) 1/2∅Rl
d) 1/2 φ2i
a
4. When a current of 5A flows through a coil of linear magnetic circuit, it has flux linkages of 2.4 wb-turns. What is the energy stored in the magnetic field of this coil in Joules?
a) 6
b) 12
c) 1.2
d) 2.4
a
5. For a linear electromagnetic circuit, which of the following statement is true?
a) Field energy is less than the Co-energy
b) Field energy is equal to the Co-energy
c) Field energy is greater than the Co-energy
d) Co-energy is zero
b
6. The electromagnetic force and/or torque, developed in any physical system, acts in such a direction as to tend to ____________
a) decrease the magnetic stored energy at constant mmf
b) decrease the magnetic stored energy at constant flux
c) increase the magnetic stored energy at constant flux
d) increase the magnetic stored energy at constant current
b
The negative sign before ∂Wfld indicates that fe acts in a direction as to tend to decrease the stored energy at constant mmf.
7. The electromagnetic force developed in any physical system acts in such a direction as to tend to _____________
a) decrease the co-energy at constant mmf
b) increase the co-energy at constant flux
c) decrease the co-energy at constant flux
d) increase the co-energy at constant mmf
d

a) decrease both the reluctance and inductance
b) increase both the reluctance and inductance
c) decrease the reluctance and increase the inductance
d) increase the reluctance and decrease the inductance
c
10. Electromagnetic force and/or torque developed in any physical system, acts in such a direction as to tend to ____________
a) increase both the field energy and co-energy at constant current
b) increase the field energy and decrease the co-energy at constant current
