9. If Bp= peak value of sinusoidal flux density wave, L = armature core length, D = armature diameter, P = number of poles, then which of the following statements are correct?

(i) flux per pole, Φ=2/PBpLD
(ii) Average flux density, Bav=2/πBp
(iii) Φ=4/PBpLD
(iv) Bav=3/πBp
(v) Bav=PΦ/πDL
(vi) Bav=PΦ/πrL
a) (i), (ii), (v)
b) (ii), (iii), (v)
c) (ii), (iii), (vi)
d) (iii), (iv), (v)
a
we know, r=D/2 ⇒ Φ=2/PBpLD and Bav=2/πBp.
As Φ = (Average value of constant amplitude flux density wave under one pole)∗ (Area pertaining to one pole of the flux density wave), Φ = (Bav)(2πrL/P)and average value of the positive or negative half cycle of a sine wave = 2/π(peak value of sine wave).
