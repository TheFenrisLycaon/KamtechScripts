a
5. The simple rotating loop between pole faces connected to a battery and resistor through a switch, the specifications of this machine are radius = 0.5m, length 1m, resistance = 0.3 ohms and magnitude strength = 0.25T is supplied with 120V. What will be the magnitude of the following current at t=0+?
a) 400A
b) 200A
c) 0
d) any of the mentioned
a
              = (120-0)/0.3
	      = 400 A.
6. If the torque induced is zero in the dc machine, it can be said that ____________
a) current is zero
b) flux can be zero
c) current or flux=0
d) any of the mentioned
a
7. The simple rotating loop between pole faces connected to a battery and resistor through a switch, the specifications of this machine are radius = 0.5m, length 1m, resistance = 0.3 ohms and magnitude strength = 0.25T is supplied with 120V. What is the steady state angular velocity at no-load?
a) 480 rad/s
b) 960 rad/s
c) 320 rad/s
d) 490 rad/s
a
               = 120/(2*0.0005*1*0.25)
	       = 480 rad/s.
8. If the torque is in the direction of rotation, the DC machine acts as ________

b) motor
c) amplidyne
d) any of the mentioned
a
9. The cogging torque is absent in the permanent magnet dc machine is due to ________
