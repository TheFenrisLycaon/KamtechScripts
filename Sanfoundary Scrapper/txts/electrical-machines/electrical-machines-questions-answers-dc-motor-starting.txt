c) speed will rise steeply
d) any of the mentioned
a
3. A 100 hp, 250 V, 350 A shunt dc motor with an armature resistance of 0.05 ohms. To limit maximum starting current to twice the rated of its value, what will be the number of stages of starting resistances?
a) 3
b) 2
c) 4
d) 5
a
              = log(0.05/0.357)/log(350/700)
			  = 2.84
                          = 3 (approx).

d) 
a
5. Following are the observations due to large starting current in dc motor.

(i) Sparking at brushes
(ii) Mechanical shock at shaft
(iii) Source current fluctuations
(iv) Burning of the field winding
a) (i), (ii), (iii), (iv)
b) (i), (iii)
c) (ii), (iii), (iv)
d) (i), (ii)
a
6. The shunt motor starters that can be used is/are ___________
a) 3-point and 4-point starter
b) 5-point starter
c) 4-point starter
d) 5-point and 3-point starter
a
7. How does the speed build up takes place in a dc motor with time?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
8. The direct-on-line starter is used to start a small dc motor because it limits initial current drawn by armature circuit.
a) True
b) False
b
9. Thyristor controlled starter is preferred over DOL starter due to _________
a) lesser losses
b) controlled direction
c) least resistance offered
d) all of the mentioned
a
10. For a 7.46 kW, 200 V dc shunt motor with full load efficiency of 85% has armature resistance of 0.25 ohms. Calculate the value of starting resistance in ohms for a current 1.5 times of the full load current.
a) 2.788
b) 3.038
c) 2.688
d) 2.588
a
             Starting current = 1.5*43.88 = 65.883 A
			 R = V/I = 200/65.883
                                 = 3.038 ohms
             Starting resistance = 3.038 – 0.25 = 2.788 ohms.
11. The effect of fringing increases as we _________
a) increase air gap
b) decrease air gap
c) increase in flux density
d) introduce more ferric core material
a
12. The post effects of the armature reaction is _________
a) main field distortion

d) none of the mentioned
d
13. If the students give a forward shift of 10° to the dc generator, then it _________
a) reduces flux per pole
b) improves flux per pole
c) increases the flux density in core
d) none of the mentioned
a
14. A dc machine is run at rated speed in forward direction and then in backward direction. It is observed that, speeds of the rotation are different, then it leads to the conclusion of _________
a) incorrect brush placement
b) incorrect pole and core alignment
c) incorrect field supply
d) all of the mentioned
a
15. For a dc machine, its commutator has a diameter of 50 c rotating at 1000 rpm. For a brush width of 1 cm, the time commutation taken by the machine will be _________
a) 0.382 ms
b) 0.456 ms
c) 0.573 ms
d) 0.312 ms
a
                                 = 1*60/(pi*50*1000)
				 = 0.382 ms.
