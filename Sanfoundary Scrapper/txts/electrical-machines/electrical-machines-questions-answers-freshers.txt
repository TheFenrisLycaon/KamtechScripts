6. If the field current and armature current are reversed, then the __________
a) direction of rotation remains same
b) direction of rotation reverses
c) stops
d) none of the mentioned
a
7. Mark the possible causes of overheating of commutator in a DC machine.
a) Overload
b) Restricted ventilation
c) Shorted winding
d) Any of the mentioned
a
8. In the hopkinson’s test on two DC machines. Machine A has field current of 1.4A and B has field current of 1.3A. Which machine acts as motor?
a) B
b) A
c) A, B
d) None of the mentioned
a
             Ea = 1.077 Eb > Eb
             So, the machine will act as motor.
9. In the Hopkinson’s test on two DC machines. Machine A has field current of 1.4A and B has field current of 1.3A. Which machine acts as generator?
a) B
b) A
c) A,B
d) None of the mentioned
b
             Ea = 1.077 Eb > Eb
             So, the machine will act as generator.
