a
4. A 3-phasle, 6-pole, 50 Hz induction motor has a full load speed of 960 rpm with its slip rings short circuited. The motor drives the constant load. If the speed is reduced to 800 rpm, then ohmic losses will _________
a) reduce
b) increase
c) reduce first then becomes constant
d) remains same
a
5. A 3-phase, 6-pole, 50 Hz induction motor has a full load speed of 960 rpm with its slip rings short circuited. The motor drives the constant load. If the speed is reduced to 800 rpm, then ohmic losses will be?
a) 5 times that at full load
b) 0.2 times as that at full load
c) 15 times as that at full load
d) same as that at full load
a
              slip at 800 rpm = 0.2
              ohmic loss at 800 rpm = (slip at 800/slip at 960 rpm)*ohmic loss at full load = 5.
6. A 3-phase, 6-pole, 50 Hz induction motor has a full load speed of 960 rpm with its slip rings short-circuited. The motor drives the constant load. If the speed is reduced to 400 rpm, then ohmic losses will be?
a) 15
b) 1/15
c) 5
d) 1/5
a
              slip at 400 rpm = 0.6
              ohmic loss at 800 rpm = (slip at 400/slip at 960 rpm)*ohmic loss at full load = 15.
7. The starting torque of the squirrel-cage induction motor is _________
a) slightly more than full load torque
b) slightly less than full load torque
