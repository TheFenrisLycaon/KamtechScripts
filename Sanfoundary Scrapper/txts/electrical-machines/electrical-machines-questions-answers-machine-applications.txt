1. Synchronous-induction coupled motors are required for ____________
a) high starting torque applications
b) high pull out torque applications
c) high running torques applications
d) none of the mentioned
a
2. Which of the following can be used for braking purposes in electric trains?
a) Induction generator
b) Induction motor
c) Dc series motor
d) Dc differentially compounded generator
a
3. A synchronous motor absorbing 60 kW is connected in parallel with an continuous load of 240 kW operating at 0.8 power factor lag.What is the kVAR supplied by the synchronous motor to obtain a total power factor of 0.9 lagging?
a) 35, leading
b) 35, lagging
c) 145, leading
d) None of the mentioned
a
             cos(phi) = 0.90. Total reactive power = P*tan(phi) = 300*tan(25.8) = 180 kVAR Load kVAR = 240*tan(36.87) = 180 kVAR
kVAR supplied by the motor = 145-180 = -35 or k3 kVAR leading.

a) capacitor
b) inductor
c) variable inductor
d) any of the mentioned
a
             Q=V (Ecos (delta)-V)/X.
