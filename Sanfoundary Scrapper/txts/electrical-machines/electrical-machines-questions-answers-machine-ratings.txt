1. Refer the diagram; a single-phase supply of 100V, 50Hz is fed to the step-up transformer having primary impedance of 1 ohms and secondary impedance 20 ohms. What is the power consumed by the load of 5 ohms?
a) 20 W
b) 40 W
c) 10 W
d) 100 W
a
                  Total resistance at secondary = 25+20 = 45 ohms
			 Total resistance seen by source = 45+5 = 50 ohms
			 Hence, current in secondary = 100/50 = 2 A
			 Power consumed by the load = I2 *R = 4*5 = 20 W.
2. If the dimension of a single phase transformer is made sqrt(3) times less than the original structure, then what is new no load current rating of the transformer?
a) 1/sqrt(3)
b) sqrt(3)
c) 3
d) 1/3*sqrt(3)
a
3. For a single phase, 50 Hz transformer, if the open circuit test is conducted at 40 Hz. What is the variation in the no-load power factor of the transformer?
a) Decreases
b) Increases
c) Remains constant
d) None of the mentioned
a
4. The desired voltage regulation for a single phase, 50 Hz transformer is zero. Its pu ohmic drop is 4% and pu reactive drop is 4%. The required power factor angle for the operation in degrees is?
a) 45
b) 90
c) 30
d) 60
a
                                                 = 4/4 = 1.
5. While conducting lab experiments on DC machine loading, the students are given a machine with its rating as 100 kW maximum rating. Then the _____________
a) machine can’t be overloaded after 100 kW
b) machine can be overloaded after 100 kW
c) machine can be overloaded by 5% for a small time duration
d) machine can be overloaded by 10%
a
6. A 3-phase, five limbed shell type transformer, star connected, 200V, 50 Hz, 100 kVA will have ___________
a) no third harmonic current in its phase but has sinusoidal flux
b) third harmonic current in its phase but has flat-topped flux
c) no third harmonic current in its phase but has flat-topped flux
d) third harmonic current in its phase but has sinusoidal flux
a
7. For a separately excited dc machine of 25 kW, 250 V and armature resistance of 0.25 ohms, is running at 3000 rpm with supply of 255 V. The electromagnetic power produced at the armature in kilo watts is?
a) 5
b) 10
c) 0.5
d) 8
a
             Power = Eb*Ia = 250*20 = 5000 W.
8. If two alternators A and B are operated in parallel having per unit synchronous reactance as 0.02 ohms and 0.05 ohms respectively.Then what the ratio of contributing loading of machine A to B?
a) 2.5
b) 0.4
c) 1
d) can not be operated in parallel
a
9. A 200V, 10 hp, 4 poles, 60 Hz, Y-connected induction motor had full load slip of 5%. Then the rotor speed of the motor with respect to stator is?
a) 1710 rpm
b) 1800 rpm
c) 90 rpm
d) 3510 rpm
a
             Rotor speed = (1-slip)*Ns = 0.95*1800 = 1710 rpm.
10. Auto transformer rating is chosen so as to have best performance when the analogous two winding transformer has ___________
a) two voltage levels fairly close to each other
b) very high transformation ratio
c) any voltage levels
d) step down purpose
a
11. In the lab, two students X and Y conducted the experiments to verify the name plate ratings of the transformer.But student X conducted the same at higher frequency. The kVA reading of student X will be ___________
a) higher than Y’s reading
b) lower than Y’s reading
c) same as Y’s reading
d) none of the mentioned
a
