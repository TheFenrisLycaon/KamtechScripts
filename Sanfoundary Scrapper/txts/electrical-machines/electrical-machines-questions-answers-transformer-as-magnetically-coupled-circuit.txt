9. In a transformer,eddy-current loss is 1000 watts which is half of the total core loss. If thickness of lamination and frequency are increased by 10%, What is the new core-losses?
a) 3200W
b) 3300W
c) 2200W
d) 3100W
a
             Here, V/f = constant
			 Pe will be same 1000W, Pi = 200+2000 = 2200W
			 Total core losses = 1000+2200 = 3200W.

a
13. Consider a 10 KVA, 2000/200 V, single phase transformer having below following parameters are r1=10Ω, r2=0.1Ω, l1 = 40mH, l2=0.4 mH, M = 10H. Then the expected primary self inductance will be?
a) 100.04H
b) 99.06H
c) 1.0004H
d) 10.04H
a
                                     = (N1/N2)*M + l1
 				 = 2000/200*10 + 0.04
				 =100.04 H.  
14. There is a 10 KVA, 2000/200 V, single phase transformer having below following parameters are r1=10Ω, r2=0.1Ω, l1 = 40mH, l2=0.4 mH, M = 10H. Then the expected secondary self inductance will be?
a) 100.04H
b) 99.06H
c) 1.0004H
d) 10.04H
c
                                     = (N2/N1)*M + l2
				     = 200/2000*10 + 0.0004H
               				 = 0.0004 H.  
15. There is a 10 KVA, 2000/200 V, single phase transformer operating at 50 Hz. Maximum flux linkages in secondary will be?
a) 0.9 AT
b) 9 AT
c) 1 AT
d) 0.09 AT
a
                           = 200/(4.44*50)  = 0.9 AT 
16. A 10 KVA, 2000/200 V, single phase transformer operating at 50 Hz with a current of 50 A flowing through the l.v. winding. Then the Self inductance of l.v. winding is?
a) 12.7mH
b) 1.27 mH
c) 12.7H
d) 0.127 H
a
                           = 200/(4.44*50)   = 0.9 AT
               Self inductance = mutual flux linkage/peak current
                             = 0.9/(1.414*50)
                             = 0.0127 H.
