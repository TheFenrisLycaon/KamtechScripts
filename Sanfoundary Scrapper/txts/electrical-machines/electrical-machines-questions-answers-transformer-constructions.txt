c) higher values
d) medium values
a
3. A transformer has comparitively much higher efficiency than a similar induction machine due to _________
a) small air gaps
b) no moving parts
c) strong coupling
d) all of the mentioned
d
4. It was needed that to isolate dc noise coming from the transmitted signal, to attain the same which machine can be used without suffering significant loss?
a) transformer
b) dc machine
c) induction machine
d) stepper motor
a
5. Which is the most widely used material in the core of the transformer?
a) cold rolled grain oriented sheet steel
b) cold rolled grain steel
c) soft iron
d) steel
a
6. The leakage flux is the flux in side the transformer which?
a) links either of the windings
b) links both of the windings
c) yoke of the core
d) windows of the core
a
7. It is advised that staggering of the butt joints _________
a) reduces reluctance of the path
b) increases air gap
c) increases mechanical strength
d) all of the mentioned
c
8. Consider two transformers X and Y having exact ratings, but have flux densities of 1.5T and 2T respectively. The weight of the transformer A per KVA will be _________
a) more than that of B
b) lesser than that of B
c) equal to that of B
d) can not be said from the given data
a
             Hence A has more area than B and so weight of A will be more than that of B.
9. Consider two transformers X and Y having identical ratings, but have flux densities of 1.5T and 2T respectively. The weight of the transformer B per KVA will be _________
a) more than that of A
b) lesser than that of A
c) equal to that of A
d) can not be said from the given data
b
             Hence A has more area than B and so weight of B will be less than that of A.

a) True
b) False
b
11. A coupling magnetic field inside a rotating machine or static machine like transformers must involve with _________

c) Half LV outside the core and half HV inside LV on each limb
d) LV and HV windings are sandwiched
d
