1. Circuit shows the method of Measurement of low resistance by Ammeter-Voltmeter method. The measured resistance Rm for the given Circuit is _________
a) Rx + Rv
b) \(\frac{R_x^2}{R_x + R_v}\) 
c) \(\frac{R_v^2}{R_x + R_v}\) 
d) \(\frac{R_x R_v}{R_x + R_v}\) 
d
\(\frac{I_v}{V_x} =  \frac{1}{R_v}\) And \(\frac{I_R}{V_x} = \frac{1}{R_X}\) 
So, Rm = \(\frac{R_x R_v}{R_x+R_v}\).
2. Circuit shows the method of Measurement of low resistance by Ammeter-Voltmeter method. What is the percentage error?
a) Zero
b) \(\frac{R_x}{R_x + R_v}\) × 100
c) \(– \frac{R_x}{R_x + R_v}\) × 100
d) \(– \frac{R_v}{R_x + R_v}\) × 100
c
\(= \frac{R_x R_v – R_x(R_x-R_v)}{R_x (R_x+R_v)}\) × 100
∴ Percentage Error = \(– \frac{R_x}{R_x + R_v}\) × 100.
3. The readings of polar type potentiometer are I = 12.4∠27.5°, V = 31.5∠38.4°. Then, reactance of the coil will be ________
a) 2.51 Ω
b) 2.56 Ω
c) 2.54 Ω
d) 2.59 Ω
c
I = 12.4∠27.5°
Z = \(\frac{31.5∠38.4°}{12.4∠27.5°}\) = 2.54∠10.9°
But Z = R + jX = 2.49 + j0.48
∴ Reactance X= 2.54 Ω.   
4. The voltage drop across a standard resistor of 0.2 Ω is balanced at 83 cm. Find the magnitude of the current, if the standard cell emf of 1.53 V is balanced at 42 m.
a) 13.04 A
b) 10 A
c) 14.95 A
d) 12.56 A
c
Voltage drop across 83 cm length = 0.036 × 83 = 2.99 V
∴ Current through resistor, I = \(\frac{2.99}{0.2}\) = 14.95 A.   
5. A resistance R is measured using the connection shown in the below figure.
The current measured is 10 A on ranges 100A and the voltage measured is 125 V on 150 V range. The scales of the ammeter and voltmeter are uniform. The total number of scale divisions of the ammeter is 100 and that of the voltmeter is 150. The scale division can be distinguished. The constructional error of the ammeter is ± 0.3% and that of voltmeter±0.4%. The resistance of the ammeter is 0.25 Ω.
The value of R is?
a) 12.75 Ω
b) 12.0 Ω
c) 12.25 Ω
d) 12.5 Ω
c
Percentage error in voltmeter= \(± \frac{1}{10×150} × 100\) = ± 0.067%
So, δI = ± 0.3 ± 0.1 = ± 0.4%
δV = ± 0.4 ± 0.067 = ± 0.467%
R = \(\frac{V}{I}\) 
So, error = ± δV ± δI = ± 0.867
Measured value of resistance = \(R_m = \frac{125}{10}\) = 12.5
∴ True value = \(R_m(1-\frac{Ra}{R_m})\) = 12.25 Ω.

d) Wein’s bridge

9. A slide wire potentiometer has 10 wires of 2 m each. With the help of a standard voltage source of 1.045 V, it is standardized by keeping the jockey at 104.5 cm. If the resistance of potentiometer wires is 2000 Ω, then the value of working current is?
a) 1 mA
b) 10 mA
c) 0.1 mA
d) 0.5 mA
b
Total resistance of slide wire = 2000 Ω
∴ Resistance per cm = 1 Ω
Resistance of 104.5 cm = 104.5 Ω
This corresponds to a voltage of 1.045 V
∴ Current = \(\frac{1.045}{104.5}\) = 10 mA.

a) Kelvin’s double bridge method
b) Carey-Foster bridge method
c) Anderson Bridge
d) Direct-Deflection method
b

a) 50 mV
b) Zero
c) 5mV
d) 0.1mV
b
R1R3 = R2R4
Here, R1 = 5, R2 = 10, R3 = 16, R4 = 8
And when the Wheatstone bridge is balanced then, at Vout voltage will be Zero.
