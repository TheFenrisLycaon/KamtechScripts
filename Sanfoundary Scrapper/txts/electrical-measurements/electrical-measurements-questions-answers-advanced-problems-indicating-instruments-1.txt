1. In a moving iron meter, the deflection torque is proportional to?
a) Square of the current through the coil
b) Current through the coil
c) Sine of measurand
d) The Square root of the measurand
a
Td = \(\frac{1}{2} I^2 \frac{dl}{dθ} \) 
∴ The deflection torque is proportional to the square of the current through the coil.
2. The full-scale deflection current of an ammeter is 4 mA and its internal resistance is 400Ω. If this meter is to have a full deflection of 10 A, what is the value of the shunt resistance to be used?
a) 49.99 Ω
b) 0.16 Ω
c) 1.5 Ω
d) 2.6 Ω
b
Current through the shunt = 10 – 0.004 = 9.996 A
∴ Shunt resistance = \(\frac{16}{10 × 9.996} \) = 0.16 Ω.
3. The full-scale deflection current of a meter is 4 mA and its internal resistance is 400Ω. This meter is to have full deflection when 400 V is measured. What is the value of the series resistor to be used?
a) 99.90 kΩ
b) 100 kΩ
c) 99.60 kΩ
d) 100 Ω
c
Or, RS = 100000 – 400 = 99.6 kΩ.
4. Two ammeters, one with a full-scale current of 1 mA and internal resistance of 100 Ω and other a full-scale current of 10 mA and internal resistance of 25 Ω are in parallel. What is the total current, these two meters can carry without the reading out of scale in any meter?
a) 1 mA
b) 10 mA
c) 11 mA
d) 5 mA
d
∴ T × \(\frac{25}{125}\) = 1 mA
Or, T = 5 mA.
5. A meter has a full scale of 90° at a current of 1 A. This meter has a perfect square law response. What is the current when the deflection angle is 45°?
a) 0.5 A
b) 0.25 A
c) 0.707 A
d) 0.67 A
c
Also, TD = KI2
∴ I2 = \(\frac{C}{K}\) θ = C’θ
Or, \(\frac{I^2}{I} = \frac{C’ π}{C’ \frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{1}{2}\) 
So, I = 0.707 A.
6. The scale of a dynamometer type instrument marked in terms of RMS value would be__________
a) Uniform throughout
b) Non-uniform and crowded near the full scale
c) Non-uniform and crowded at the beginning
d) Non-uniform and crowded around mid-scale
c
7. Moving Iron Instrument can be used as ____________
a) An ammeter for measuring DC as well as AC
b) For measuring DC current and voltages only
c) An ammeter and a voltmeter for measuring DC as well as AC
d) For measuring AC current and voltages only
c
8. A 10 mA PMMC ammeter reads 4 mA in a circuit. Its bottom control spring snaps suddenly. The meter will now show __________
a) 10 mA
b) 8 mA
c) 2 mA
d) Zero
d
9. The standardization of AC potentiometer is done by ____________
a) Using a DC standard source and d’ Arsonval galvanometer
b) Using AC standard sources and transfer instruments
c) Using a standard AC voltage source
d) Using a DC standard source and transfer instruments
d
10. The inductance of a certain moving- iron ammeter is expressed as L = 10 + 3θ – \(\frac{θ^2}{4}\) μH, where θ is the deflection in radian from the zero position. The control spring torque is 25 × 10-6 Nm/rad. The meter carries a current of 5 A. What is the deflection?
a) 2.4
b) 2.0
c) 1.2
d) 1.0
c
Kθ = \(\frac{1}{2} I^2 \frac{dl}{dθ} \) 
(25 × 10-6) θ = \(\frac{1}{2} I^2 (3 – \frac{θ}{2}) \) × 10-6
∴ 2 θ + \(\frac{θ}{2}\) = 3
Or, θ = 1.2.
