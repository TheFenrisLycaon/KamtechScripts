1. Q meter operator is the principle of __________
a) Series resonance
b) Current resonance
c) Self-inductance
d) Eddy currents
a
From the above relation, we can say that it works on series resonance.
2. In a Q Meter, the values of tuning capacitor are C3 and C4 for resonant frequencies f3 and 2f4 respectively. The value of distributed capacitance is?
a) \(\frac{C_3-C_4}{2}\) 
b) \(\frac{C_3-2C_4}{3}\) 
c) \(\frac{C_3-4C_4}{3}\) 
d) \(\frac{C_3-3C_4}{2}\) 
c
The main error in the measurement of Q is due to the distribution. To check for this, the Q value is measured at two frequencies f1 and 2f2. It should be same, if not then, \(\frac{C_3-4C_4}{3}\).
3. A circuit tuned to a frequency of 1.5 MHz and having an effective capacitance of 150 pF. In this circuit, the current falls to 70.7 % of its resonant value. The frequency deviates from the resonant frequency by 5 kHz. Q factor is?
a) 50
b) 100
c) 150
d) 200
c
Here, f = 1.5 × 106 Hz
f1 = (1.5 × 106 – 5 × 103)
f2 = (1.5 × 106 + 5 × 103)
So, f2 – f1 = 10 × 103 Hz
Q = \(\frac{1.5 × 10^6}{10 × 10^3}\) = 150.
4. A circuit tuned to a frequency of 1.5 MHz and having an effective capacitance of 150 pF. In this circuit, the current falls to 70.7 % of its resonant value. The deviates from the resonant frequency are 5 kHz. Effective resistance of the circuit is?
a) 2 Ω
b) 3 Ω
c) 5.5 Ω
d) 4.7 Ω
d
Here, f = 1.5 × 106 Hz
f1 = (1.5 × 106 – 5 × 103)
f2 = (1.5 × 106 + 5 × 103)
So, f2 – f1 = 10 × 103 Hz
R = \(\frac{10 × 10^3}{2π(1.5 × 10^6)^2 L}\) 
R = 4.7 Ω.
5. Q Meter is used to measure _________
a) Q factor of an inductive coil
b) Only the effective resistance
c) Only bandwidth

d

a) Equal to
b) Same but somewhat lesser than
c) Same but somewhat higher than
d) Not equal to
b
7. Consider a circuit consisting of two capacitors C1 and C2. Let R be the resistance and L be the inductance which are connected in series. Let Q1 and Q2 be the quality factor for the two capacitors. While measuring the Q value by the Series Connection method, the value of the Q factor is?
a) Q = \(\frac{(C_1 – C_2 ) Q_1 Q_2}{Q_1 C_1 – Q_2 C_2}\) 
b) Q = \( \frac{(C_2 – C_1 ) Q_1 Q_2}{Q_1 C_1 – Q_2 C_2}\) 
c) Q = \( \frac{(C_1 – C_2 ) Q_1 Q_2}{Q_2 C_2 – Q_1 C_1}\) 
d) Q = \( \frac{(C_2 – C_1 ) C_1 C_2}{Q_1 C_1 – Q_2 C_2}\) 
a
XS = \(\frac{C_1-C_2}{ωC_1 C_2 }\), RS = \(\frac{Q_1 C_1 – Q_2 C_2}{ωC_1 C_2 Q_1 Q_2}\) 
QX = \(\frac{X_S}{R_S}  = \frac{(C_1- C_2) Q_1 Q_2}{Q_1 C_1-Q_2 C_2}\).
8. Consider a circuit consisting of two capacitors C1 and C2. Let R be the resistance and L be the inductance which are connected in series. Let Q1 and Q2 be the quality factor for the two capacitors. While measuring the Q value by the Parallel Connection method, the value of the Q factor is?
a) Q = \(\frac{(C_1 – C_2 ) Q_1 Q_2}{Q_1 C_1 – Q_2 C_2}\) 
b) Q = \(\frac{(C_2 – C_1 ) Q_1 Q_2}{Q_1 C_1 – Q_2 C_2}\) 
c) Q = \(\frac{(C_1 – C_2 ) Q_1 Q_2}{Q_2 C_2 – Q_1 C_1}\) 
d) Q = \(\frac{(C_2 – C_1 ) C_1 C_2}{Q_1 C_1 – Q_2 C_2}\) 
b
Q = \(\frac{(C_2 – C_1 ) Q_1 Q_2}{Q_1 C_1 – Q_2 C_2}\).
9. Consider the following statements regarding the sources of error in a Q Meter.
i) If a coil with a resistance R is connected in the direct measurement mode and
If the residual resistance of the Q Meter is 0.1 R, 
Then the measured Q of the coil would be 1.1 times the actual Q.
ii) If the inductance to be measured is less than 0.1 μH.
The error due to the presence of residual inductance cannot be neglected.
iii) The presence of a distributed capacitance modifies the effective Q of the coil.
Which of the above statements are correct?
a) i, ii and iii
b) i and ii
c) ii and iii
d) i and iii
c
With Q Meter resistance considered, the measured or indicated Q is 1/1.11 times the actual Q. Thus, statement (i) is incorrect. Hence, statements (ii) and (iii) are correct. 
10. The function of the Q- Meter is to _________
a) Measure capacitance
b) Measure inductance
c) Measure quality factor of capacitor and inductor
d) Measure form factor of capacitor and inductor
c
