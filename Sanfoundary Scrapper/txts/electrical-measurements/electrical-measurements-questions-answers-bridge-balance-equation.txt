1. Bridge balance equation for magnitude is given by which of the following relation?
a) Z1 Z4 = Z2 Z3
b) Z1 Z2 = Z3 Z4
c) Z2 Z4 = Z1 Z3
d) Z1 Z3 = Z2 Z4
a
Z1 Z4 = Z2 Z3
where, Z1, Z2, Z3 and Z4 are the impedance arms of the AC bridge circuit.
2. Angular balance equation is given by which of the following relation?
a) θ1 × θ4 = θ2 × θ3
b) θ1 + θ4 = θ2 + θ3
c) θ2 + θ4 = θ1 + θ3
d) θ2 × θ4 = θ1 × θ3
b
θ1 + θ4 = θ2 + θ3
Where,
θ1, θ2, θ3 and θ4 are the phase angles of the impedances Z1, Z2, Z3 and Z4.
