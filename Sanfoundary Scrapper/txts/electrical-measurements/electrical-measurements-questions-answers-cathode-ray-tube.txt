8. Horizontal deflection is given by ________
a) x = Kx
b) x = Vx
c) x = 1
d) x = Kx Vx
d
x = Kx Vx
where, Kx is the constant of proportionality
            x is the horizontal deflection
            Vx is the horizontal deflecting voltage.
9. Vertical deflection is given by ________
a) y = Ky Vy
b) y = Ky
c) x = 1
d) y = Vy
a
y = Ky Vy
where, Ky is the constant of proportionality
            y is the vertical deflection
            Vy is the vertical deflecting voltage.
