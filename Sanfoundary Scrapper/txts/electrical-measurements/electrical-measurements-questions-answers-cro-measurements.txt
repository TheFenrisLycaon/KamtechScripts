5. The amplitude of voltage is given by which of the following relation?
a) Vm = \(\frac{V_{p-p}}{2}\) 
b) Vm = \(\frac{V_{p-p}}{4}\) 
c) Vm = 2 × Vp-p
d) Vm = 4 × Vp-p
a
Vm = \(\frac{V_{p-p}}{2}\) 
	where, Vp-p is the peak to peak voltage
                        Vm is the amplitude.

c) Vrms = \(\frac{V_m}{8}\) 
d) Vrms = \(\frac{V_m}{\sqrt{8}}\) 
b
Vrms = \(\frac{V_m}{\sqrt{2}}\) 
where, Vrms is the r.m.s value of voltage
	      Vm is the amplitude of the voltage.
7. CRO is voltage measuring device.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Period of a waveform is obtained by which of the following relation?
