1. The secondary leakage reactance of a C.T. ____________
a) increases its ratio error
b) decreases its ratio error
c) has no effect on its ratio error
d) increases the impedance of the circuit
a
2. Secondary and primary windings consist of ________
a) copper turns
b) 14 S.W.G copper wire and copper strip respectively
c) iron coils wound around
d) laminations
b

6. Turns compensation is used to obtain ________
a) to compensate the turns
b) to equalise the turns on the windings
c) to protect the equipment
d) transformation ratio equal to nominal ratio
d
R = n + Ie⁄Is
where, n is the turns ratio
            Ie is the core loss component of the excitation current
	      Is is the secondary winding current
Turns compensation is used to obtain the transformation ratio (R) equal to the nominal ratio (Kn).
7. What is the effect of reducing the secondary turns in a C.T. by 1%?
a) transformation ratio reduces by the same value
b) no effect
c) nominal ratio increase by the same value
d) secondary current increases by the same value
a
R = n + Ie⁄Is
where, n is the turns ratio
            Ie is the core loss component of the excitation current
	      Is is the secondary winding current
As the number of secondary turns is reduced by a factor of 1%, the transformation ratio (R) is reduced by approximately the same percentage.
8. In a 1000/5 A C.T., the number of secondary turns would be ________
a) 200
b) 199 or 198
c) 5
d) 1000
b
9. In the ring type of core, the secondary winding is ________
a) non-uniformly distributed over the core
b) shorted with the primary winding
c) uniformly distributed over the core
d) connected in the form of a ring
c
10. In a shell type of core, the windings are ________
a) in the form of the shell
b) shorted with the primary windings
c) not wound
d) placed on the central limb
d
11. Mumetal has ________
a) low permeability, high loss
b) high permeability, medium loss
c) medium permeability, high loss
d) high permeability, low loss
c
12. Perminder has __________
a) medium saturation point of permeability
b) low saturation point of permeability
c) no saturation point of permeability
d) high saturation point of permeability
d
