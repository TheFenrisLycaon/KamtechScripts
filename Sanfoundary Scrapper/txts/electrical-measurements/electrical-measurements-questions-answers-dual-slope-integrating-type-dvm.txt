1. Why is dual slope method preferred over ramp techniques?
a) no noise
b) partial noise
c) average noise
d) maximum noise
a
2. What is the significance of the name dual slope method?
a) it has two slopes
b) it integrates the input twice
c) it uses two inputs
d) it has two outputs
b
3. What is the output voltage in a dual slope integrating type DVM?
a) differential of the input
b) multiple of the input
c) integral of the input
d) zero
c
where, Vin is the input voltage
	      R1 is the series resistance
	      t1 is the time for which the capacitor is charged.
4. Input voltage depends on ____________
a) resistance
b) capacitance
c) current
d) time-period
d
Vin = Vref t2 ⁄ t1
From the above equation it is seen that the input voltage in a dual slope integrating type DVM depends on the time periods t1 for which the capacitor is charged and t2 during which the capacitor is discharged.
5. Noise rejection is poor.
a) True
b) False
b
6. What is the effect of the capacitor on the output?
a) no effect
b) charging effect
c) electrostatic effect
d) magnetic effect
a
7. What is the effect of clock on the voltage?
a) voltage doubles with clock input
b) voltage halves with clock input
c) no effect
d) voltage becomes zero with clock input
c
8. What is the counter value at the beginning?
a) one
b) ten
c) three
d) zero
d
9. What is the maximum count of the counter?
a) 9999
b) 0
c) 500
d) 1000
a
