1. Mutual inductance between two coils is given as _________
a) M = k\(\sqrt{L_1 L_2}\) 
b) M = k\(\sqrt{L_1}\) 
c) M = k\(\sqrt{L_2}\) 
d) M = \(\sqrt{L_1 L_2}\) 
a
M = k\(\sqrt{L_1 L_2}\) 
where, k is the coefficient of coupling
	      M is the mutual inductance between the coils.
2. Mutual inductance depends on _________
a) self-inductance
b) self-inductance and coefficient of coupling
c) coefficient of coupling
d) permittivity of air
b
3. Self-inductance of an inductor is given by ________
a) L = N⁄S
b) L = 1⁄S
c) L = N2⁄S
d) L = N2
c
L = N2⁄S
where, N is the number of coil
            S is the reluctance of the coil (A/Wb).
4. Reluctance of a coil is given by which of the following relation?
a) S = 1⁄A
b) S = 1⁄μ
c) S = a⁄μA
d) S = 1⁄μA
d
S = 1⁄μA
where, l is the length of the magnetic circuit (m)
            a is the area of the magnetic circuit which encloses the flux (m2)
            µ is the permeability of the core (H/m).
5. Self-inductance depends on ________
a) permeability
b) permittivity
c) plank’s constant
d) rydberg constant
a
L = N2⁄S
where, N is the number of coil
            S is the reluctance of the coil (A/Wb)
As reluctance depends on the permeability, the self-inductance of a coil depends on the permeability.
6. What is the relation between the self-inductance and the reluctance of a coil?
a) directly proportional
b) inversely proportional
c) no relation
d) constant
b
L = N2⁄S
where, N is the number of coil
            S is the reluctance of the coil (A/Wb)
We observe from the above equation that the self-inductance of a coil is inversely proportional to its reluctance.
7. Based on self-inductance of a coil, how many types of inductive transducers are available?
a) 5
b) 10
c) 4
d) 20
c
i) Variable permeability inductive transducer
ii) Variable reluctance inductive transducer
iii) Eddy current inductive transducer
iv) Linear variable differential transducer.
8. In an eddy current transducer output depends on the variation in the eddy current.
a) True
b) False
a
9. An inductive transducer measures the variation in ________
a) reluctance
b) resistance
c) capacitance
d) self-inductance
d
10. Inductive transducer is used for the measurement of physical quantities.
a) True
b) False
a
