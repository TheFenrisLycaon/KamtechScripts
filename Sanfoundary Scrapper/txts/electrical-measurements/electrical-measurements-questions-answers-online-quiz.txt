5. What is the role of logic control and sequencer in a successive approximation type DVM?
a) generate analog voltage
b) generate power
c) generate current through resistance
d) generate sequence code
d
6. Resolution of a successive approximation type DVM is given by which of the following relation?
a) R = 1⁄10n
b) R = 1⁄10
c) R =10n
d) R = 10
a
R = 1⁄10n
where, R is the resolution
	      n is the number of digits.
7. Sensitivity of a successive approximation type DVM is given by which of the following relation?
a) S = fsmin
b) S = fsmin × R
c) S = R
d) S = fsmin ⁄ R
b
S = fsmin × R
where, S is the sensitivity
            R is the resolution
            fsmin is the full scale reading when the range is minimum.
