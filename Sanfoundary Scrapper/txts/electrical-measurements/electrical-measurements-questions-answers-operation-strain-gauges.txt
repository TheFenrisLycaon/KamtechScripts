8. Gauge factor is given by which of the following relation?
a) S = \(\frac{\Delta R/R}{\Delta l}\) 
b) S = \(\frac{\Delta R}{\Delta l/l}\) 
c) S = \(\frac{R}{\Delta l/l}\)

d
S = \(\frac{\Delta R/R}{\Delta l/l}\) 
where, S is the gauge factor
	      R is the gauge wire resistance
            ∆R is the change in resistance
	      l is the length of the wire in unstressed condition
            ∆l is the change in length of the wire.
