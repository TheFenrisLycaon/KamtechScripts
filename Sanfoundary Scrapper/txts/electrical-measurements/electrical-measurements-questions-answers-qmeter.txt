d
5. Q factor for a series resonant circuit is?
a) Q = \(\frac{X_L}{R} = \frac{X_C}{R}\) 
b) Q = XL R = XC R
c) Q = \(\frac{R}{X_L} = \frac{R}{X_C}\) 
d) Q = \(\frac{1}{R}\) 
a
Q = \(\frac{X_L}{R} = \frac{X_C}{R}\) 
where, R is resistance of the coil
            XC is the capacitive reactance
            XL is the inductive reactance.
6. What is the relation between Q factor and voltage?
a) Q = \(\frac{1}{E}\) 
b) Q = \(\frac{X_L}{R}=\frac{X_C}{R}=\frac{E_C}{E}\) 
c) Q = E
d) Q = \(\frac{R}{X_L}=\frac{R}{X_C}=\frac{E}{E_C}\) 
b
Q = \(\frac{X_L}{R}=\frac{X_C}{R}=\frac{E_C}{E}\).
