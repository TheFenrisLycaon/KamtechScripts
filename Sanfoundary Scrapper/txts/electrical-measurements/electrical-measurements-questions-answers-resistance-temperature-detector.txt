1. Resistance temperature detector is ___________
a) a electrical transducer
b) a mechanical transducer
c) a chemical transducer
d) a physical transducer
a
2. Relation between temperature and resistance of a conductor is ________
a) Rt = Rref [1+t] 
b) Rt = Rref [1+α∆t] 
c) Rt = Rref [1-αt] 
d) Rt = Rref [1-t] 
b
Rt = Rref [1+α∆t] 
where, Rt is the resistance of the conductor at t°C.
Rref is the resistance of the conductor at reference temperature
α is the temperature coefficient of resistance
∆t is the difference between the temperature being measured and the reference temperature.
