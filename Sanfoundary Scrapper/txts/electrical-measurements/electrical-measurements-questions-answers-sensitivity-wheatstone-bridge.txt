1. When the bridge is balanced, what is the current flowing through the galvanometer?
a) 0
b) depends on the ratio arms R1 and R2
c) varies by a factor of 2
d) depends on the type of null detector used
a
2. Amount of deflection of the galvanometer depends on _________
a) resistance of the ratio arms
b) sensitivity
c) current flowing through the bridge
d) emf across the circuit
b
3. Sensitivity is defined as _________
a) amount of voltage per unit current
b) amount of power per unit voltage
c) amount of resistance per unit voltage
d) amount of deflection per unit current
d
Thus sensitivity is defined as the amount of deflection per unit current.
4. Sensitivity is expressed in _________
a) cm/A
b) m/mA
c) mm/µA
d) inch/nA
c
where, deflection is in mm and current is in µA.
So the unit of sensitivity is mm/ µA.
5. What is the relation between the sensitivity and deflection for a galvanometer?
a) directly proportional
b) inversely proportional
c) independant of each other
d) depends on the type of galvanometer used
a
Thus we see that sensitivity is directly proportional to the deflection.
6. The voltage sensitivity of a galvanometer is given by _________
a) Sv = e⁄θ
b) Sv = θ⁄e
c) Sv = 1⁄e
d) Sv = 1⁄θ
b
Voltage sensitivity is defined as the amount of deflection per unit voltage and is given by the relation
Sv = θ⁄e.
7. Unit of voltage sensitivity is _________
a) volts per degrees
b) amps per ohms
c) degrees per volts
d) watts per amps
c
So the unit of voltage sensitivity is degrees per volts as deflection is measured in degrees and voltage is in volts.
8. Bridge sensitivity is defined as _________
a) \(S_B=\frac{\theta}{R}\) 
b) \(S_B=\frac{\theta}{\Delta R}\) 
c) \(S_B=\frac{1}{\frac{\Delta R}{R}}\) 
d) \(S_B=\frac{\theta}{\frac{\Delta R}{R}}\) 
d
\(S_B=\frac{\theta}{\frac{\Delta R}{R}}\) 
Here ∆R/R denotes the fractional change in the unknown resistance.
9. Maximum sensitivity occurs when?
a) R3 ⁄ R4 = 1
b) R2 ⁄ R4 = 1
c) R1 ⁄ R2 = 1
d) R3 ⁄ R2 = 1
a
Here E is the emf of the circuit. For maximum bridge sensitivity, we get R3=R4.
