1. Range of an electrical instrument depends on __________
a) current
b) voltage
c) power
d) resistance
a
2. Moving coil instruments have a current and voltage rating of __________
a) 100 A and 25 V
b) 50 mA and 50 mV
c) 75 nA and 100 μV
d) 25 μA and 75 V
b
3. A shunt is a __________
a) very high resistance
b) medium resistance
c) very low resistance
d) high resistance
c
4. A shunt can be used to measure large currents.
a) True
b) False
a
5. Current terminals have a small current capacity.
a) True
b) False
b
6. Potential terminals have a __________
a) high current capacity
b) low voltage capacity
c) low current capacity
d) high voltage capacity
c
7. In case of AC ammeters, shunts consist of __________
a) impedance
b) capacitance
c) resistance
d) inductance
d
8. What is the effect of the ammeter range on the shunt resistance?
a) no effect
b) varies by a factor of multiplying factor
c) varies by a factor of the resistance
d) varies by a factor of unity
b
N = 1 + Ra⁄Rs
where, N is the multiplying factor
	      Ra is the ammeter resistance
            Rs is the shunt resistance
It is clear from the above equation that in order to increase the ammeter range by N times, the shunt resistance is equivalent to 1⁄N-1.
9. A multiplier is __________
a) non-inductive
b) resistive
c) capacitive
d) non-capacitive
a
10. What is the condition for using a multiplier in A.C. voltmeters?
a) by using ac supply
b) by maintaining a uniform impedance
c) by maintaining a uniform frequency
d) by using a galvanometer
c
