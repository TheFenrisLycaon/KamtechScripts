1. R.M.S value means _________
a) root mean square
b) rate mean second
c) root median second
d) rate mode second
a
2. Meter reading is obtained by ________
a) sensing voltage
b) sensing heat power
c) sensing current
d) sensing resistance
b
3. Measurement of heat power ________
a) uses a heat sink
b) uses a thermometer
c) uses a thermocouple
d) uses a black body
c
4. Sufficient heating of the heater is ensured by ________
a) increasing the temperature
b) making use of induction coil
c) amplifying d.c. input
d) amplifying a.c. input
d
5. Power in a thermocouple is given by ________
a) Power =  E2 rms / Rheater
b) Power = E2 rms
c) Power = Rheater
d) Power = E2 rms × Rheater
a
Power =  E2 rms ⁄ Rheater
where, Erms is the r.m.s value of the a.c. input signal
            Rheater is the resistance of the heater.
6. What is the main disadvantage of a true r.m.s responding voltmeter?
a) presence of transducer
b) presence of thermocouple
c) presence of transformer
d) presence of oscillator
b

a) thermocouple 1 and thermocouple 2
b) input thermocouple and output thermocouple
c) measuring thermocouple and balancing thermocouple
d) internal thermocouple and external thermocouple
c
8. Sensitivity is of the order of ________
a) MV
b) V
c) GV
d) mV
d
9. Response of thermocouples is fast.
a) True
b) False
b
