1.	Find the conductivity of a material with conduction current density 100 units and electric field of 4 units.
a)	25
b)	400
c)	0.04
d)	1600
a
2.	Calculate the displacement current density when the electric flux density is 20sin 0.5t.
a)	10sin 0.5t
b)	10cos 0.5t
c)	20sin 2t
d)	20cos 2t
b
Jd = d(20sin 0.5t)/dt = 20cos 0.5t (0.5) = 10cos 0.5t.
3.	Find the magnitude of the displacement current density in air at a frequency of 18GHz in frequency domain. Take electric field E as 4 units.
a)	18
b)	72
c)	36
d)	4
d
Jd = εωE = ε(2πf)E. On substituting, we get 4 ampere.
4.	Calculate the frequency at which the conduction and displacement currents become equal with unity conductivity in a material of permittivity 2.
a)	18 GHz
b)	9 GHz
c)	36 GHz
d)	24 GHz
b
5.	The ratio of conduction to displacement current density is referred to as
a)	Attenuation constant
b)	Propagation constant

d)	Dielectric constant
c
6.	If the loss tangent is very less, then the material will be a
a)	Conductor
b)	Lossless dielectric
c)	Lossy dielectric
d)	Insulator
b
7.	In good conductors, the electric and magnetic fields will be
a)	45 in phase
b)	45 out of phase
c)	90 in phase
d)	90 out of phase
b
8.	In free space, which of the following will be zero?
a)	Permittivity
b)	Permeability
c)	Conductivity
d)	Resistivity
c
9.	If the intrinsic angle is 20, then find the loss tangent.
a)	tan 20
b)	tan 40
c)	tan 60
d)	tan 80
b
10.	The intrinsic impedance of free space is given by
a)	272 ohm
b)	412 ohm
c)	740 ohm
d)	377 ohm
d
On substituting the values, we get η = 377 ohm.
