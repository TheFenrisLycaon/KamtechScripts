1.	The electric field intensity is defined as
a)	Force per unit charge
b)	Force on a test charge
c)	Force per unit charge on a test charge
d)	Product of force and charge
c
2.	Find the force on a charge 2C in a field 1V/m.
a)	0
b)	1
c)	2
d)	3
c
F = q X E = 2 X 1 = 2 N.
3.	Find the electric field intensity of two charges 2C and -1C separated by a distance 1m in air.
a)	18 X 109
b)	9 X 109
c)	36 X 109
d)	-18 X 109
b
E = F/q = 18 X 109/2 = 9 X 109.
4.	What is the electric field intensity at a distance of 20cm from a charge 2 X 10-6 C in vacuum?
a)	250,000
b)	350,000
c)	450,000
d)	550,000
c
= (2 X 10-6)/(4∏ X εo X 0.22) = 450,000 V/m.

5.	Determine the charge that produces an electric field strength of 40 V/cm at a distance of 30cm in vacuum(in 10-8C)
a)	4
b)	2
c)	8
d)	6
a
Q = (4000 X 0.32)/ (9 X 109) = 4 X 10-8 C.
6.	The field intensity of a charge defines the impact of the charge on a test charge placed at a distance. It is maximum at d = 0cm and minimises as d increases. State True/False
a)	True
b)	False
a
7.	Electric field of an infinitely long conductor of charge density λ, is given by E = λ/(2πεh).aN. State True/False.
a)	True
b)	False
a
For an infinitely long conductor, α = 0. E = λ/(4πεh).(cos 0 + cos 0) = λ/(2πεh).aN.
8.	Electric field intensity due to infinite sheet of charge σ is
a)	Zero
b)	Unity
c)	σ/ε
d)	σ/2ε
d
Here, h is the distance of the sheet from point P and a is the radius of the sheet. For infinite sheet, α = 90. Thus E = σ/2ε.
9.	For a test charge placed at infinity, the electric field will be
a)	Unity
b)	+∞
c)	Zero
d)	-∞
c
When distance d is infinity, the electric field will be zero, E= 0.
10.	In electromagnetic waves, the electric field will be perpendicular to which of the following?
a)	Magnetic field intensity
b)	Wave propagation
c)	Both H and wave direction
d)	It propagates independently
c
