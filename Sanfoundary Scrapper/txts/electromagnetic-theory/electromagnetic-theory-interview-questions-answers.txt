b
4.	Given the potential V = 25 sin θ, in free space, determine whether V satisfies Laplace’s equation.
a)	Yes
b)	No
c)	Data sufficient
d)	Potential is not defined
a
(Del)2V = (Del)2(25 sin θ), which is not equal to zero. Thus the field does not satisfy Laplace equation.

5.	If a potential V is 2V at x = 1mm and is zero at x=0 and volume charge density is -106εo, constant throughout the free space region between x = 0 and x = 1mm. Calculate V at x = 0.5mm.
a)	0.875
b)	0.675
c)	0.475
d)	0.275
d
On integrating twice with respect to x, V = 106. (x2/2) + C1x + C2.
Substitute the boundary conditions, x = 0, V = 0 and x = 1mm, V = 2V in V,
C1 = 1500 and C2 = 0. At x = 0.5mm, we get, V = 0.875V.
6.	Find the Laplace equation value of the following potential field
V = x2 – y2 + z2
a)	0
b)	2
c)	4
d)	6
b
