1.	Find the current when the charge is a time function given by q(t) = 3t + t2 at 2 seconds.
a)	3
b)	5
c)	7
d)	9
c
2.	The continuity equation is a combination of which of the two laws?
a)	Ohm’s law and Gauss law
b)	Ampere law and Gauss law
c)	Ohm’s law and Ampere law
d)	Maxwell law and Ampere law
b
3.	Calculate the charge density for the current density given 20sin x i + ycos z j at the origin.
a)	20t
b)	21t
c)	19t
d)	-20t
b
– dρ/dt. Div(J) = 20cos x + cos z. At origin, we get 20cos 0 + cos 0 = 21. To get ρ, on integrating the Div(J) with respect to t, the charge density will be 21t.
