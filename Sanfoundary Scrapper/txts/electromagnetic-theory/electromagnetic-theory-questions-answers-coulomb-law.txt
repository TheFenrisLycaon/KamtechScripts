a)	Electrostatics
b)	Magnetostatics
c)	Electromagnetics
d)	Maxwell theory
a
3.	Find the force between 2C and -1C separated by a distance 1m in air(in newton).
a)	18 X 106
b)	-18 X 106
c)	18 X 10-6
d)	-18 X 10-6
b
4.	Two charges 1C and -4C exists in air. What is the direction of force?
a)	Away from 1C
b)	Away from -4C
c)	From 1C to -4C
d)	From -4C to 1C
c
5.	Find the force of interaction between 60 stat coulomb and 37.5 stat coulomb spaced 7.5cm apart in transformer oil(εr=2.2) in 10-4 N,
a)	8.15
b)	5.18
c)	1.518
d)	1.815
d
F = (1.998 X 1.2488 X 10-16)/(4∏ X 8.854 X 10-12 X 2.2 X (7.5 X 10-2)2) = 1.815 X 10-4 N.
6.	Find the force between two charges when they are brought in contact and separated by 4cm apart, charges are 2nC and -1nC, in μN.
a)	1.44
b)	2.44
c)	1.404
d)	2.404
c
After charges are brought into contact and then separated, charge on each sphere is, (q1 + q2)/2 = 0.5nC
On calculating the force with q1 = q2 = 0.5nC, F = 1.404μN.
7.	The Coulomb law is an implication of which law?
a)	Ampere law
b)	Gauss law
c)	Biot Savart law
d)	Lenz law
b
8.	Two small diameter 10gm dielectric balls can slide freely on a vertical channel. Each carry a negative charge of 1μC. Find the separation between the balls if the lower ball is restrained from moving.
a)	0.5
b)	0.4
c)	0.3
d)	0.2
c
On calculating r by substituting charges, we get r = 0.3m.
9.	A charge of 2 X 10-7 C is acted upon by a force of 0.1N. Determine the distance to the other charge of 4.5 X 10-7 C, both the charges are in vacuum.
a)	0.03
b)	0.05
c)	0.07
d)	0.09
d
We get r = 0.09m.
10.	 For a charge Q1, the effect of charge Q2 on Q1 will be,
a)	F1 = F2
b)	F1 = -F2
c)	F1 = F2 = 0
d)	F1 and F2 are not equal
