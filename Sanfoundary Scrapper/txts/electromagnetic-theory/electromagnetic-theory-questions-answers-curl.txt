1. Curl is defined as the angular velocity at every point of the vector field. State True/False.
a) True
b) False
a
2. The curl of curl of a vector is given by,
a) Div(Grad V) – (Del)2V
b) Grad(Div V) – (Del)2V
c) (Del)2V – Div(Grad V)
d) (Del)2V – Grad(Div V)
b
3. Which of the following theorem use the curl operation?
a) Green’s theorem
b) Gauss Divergence theorem
c) Stoke’s theorem
d) Maxwell equation
c
4. The curl of a curl of a vector gives a
a) Scalar
b) Vector
c) Zero value
d) Non zero value
b
5. Find the curl of the vector and state its nature at (1,1,-0.2)
F = 30 i + 2xy j + 5xz2 k
a) √4.01
b) √4.02
c) √4.03
d) √4.04
d
6. Is the vector is irrotational. E = yz i + xz j + xy k
a) Yes
b) No
a
i(x – x) – j(y – y) + k(z – z) = 0
Since the curl is zero, the vector is irrotational or curl-free.
7. Find the curl of A = (y cos ax)i + (y + ex)k
a) 2i – ex j – cos ax k
b) i – ex j – cos ax k
c) 2i – ex  j + cos ax k
d) i – ex j + cos ax k
b
= 1.i – j(ex) – k cos ax = i – ex j – cos ax k.
8. Find the curl of the vector A = yz i + 4xy j + y k
a) xi + j + (4y – z)k
b) xi + yj + (z – 4y)k
c) i + j + (4y – z)k
d) i + yj + (4y – z)k
d
i + y j + (4y – z)k, which is option d.
9. Curl cannot be employed in which one of the following?
a) Directional coupler
b) Magic Tee
c) Isolator and Terminator
d) Waveguides
d
10. Which of the following Maxwell equations use curl operation?
a) Maxwell 1st  and 2nd equation
b) Maxwell 3rd and 4th equation
c) All the four equations
d) None of the equations
a
Maxwell 2nd equation, Curl (E) = -D(B)/Dt (Faraday’s law)
Maxwell 3rd equation, Div (D) = Q (Gauss law for electric field)
Maxwell 4th equation, Div (B) = 0(Gauss law for magnetic field)
It is clear that only 1st and 2nd equations use the curl operation.
