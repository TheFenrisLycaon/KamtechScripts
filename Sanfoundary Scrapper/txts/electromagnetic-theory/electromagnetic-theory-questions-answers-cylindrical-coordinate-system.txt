1. The cylindrical coordinate system is also referred to as
a) Cartesian system
b) Circular system
c) Spherical system
d) Space system
b
2. Transform the vector B=yi+(x+z)j located at point (-2,6,3) into cylindrical coordinates.
a) (6.325,-71.57,3)
b) (6.325,71.57,3)
c) (6.325,73.57,3)
d) (6.325,-73.57,3)
a
 Φ = tan-1(y/x) = tan-1(-6/2) = -71.57
z = 3.
3. Cylindrical systems have the following scalar values respectively
a) 1, ρ ,1
b) 1, 1, 1
c) 0,1,0
d) 1,0,0
a
4. A charge located at point p (5,30⁰,2) is said to be in which coordinate system?
a) Cartesian system
b) Cylindrical system
c) Spherical system
d) Space system
b
5. Cylindrical system is employed in waveguides. State True/False.
a) True
b) False
a
6. The pressure inside a piston cylinder is a variable of
a) Radius
b) Plane angle
c) Z plane distance
d) Constant, not a variable
c
7. Charges filled inside a cylindrical will possess flux in which direction?
a) Upwards
b) Downwards
c) Laterally outwards
d) Inwards
c
8. Rectangular waveguides dominate the circular waveguides. Find the reason.
a) Low cut-off frequency
b) Easy to design
c) More wave propagation
d) The statement is false
b
9. Transform the spherical system B = (10/r)i + (10cos θ)j + k into cylindrical form at (5, π/2, -2)
a) 2.467i + j + 1.167k
b) 2.467i – j + 1.167k
c) 2.467i – j – 1.167k
d) 2.467i + j – 1.167k
a
B = (10sin θ/r + rcos2θ)i + j + (10cos θ/r –r sin θ cos θ)k
At (5, π/2, -2), r = √(52+-22) = √29
sin θ = 5/√29 and cos θ = -2/√29
Thus, B = 2.467i + j + 1.167k.
10. Convert the given rectangular coordinates A(2,3,1) into corresponding cylindrical coordinates
a) (3.21,56.31,1)
b) (3.21,57.31,0)
c) (3.61,57.31,0)
d) (3.61,56.31,1)
d
Φ = tan-1(y/x) = 56.31
z = 1
Thus, A = (3.61,56.31,1).
