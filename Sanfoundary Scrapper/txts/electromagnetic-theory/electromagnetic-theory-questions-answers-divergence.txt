5. Given D = e-xsin y i – e-xcos y j
Find divergence of D.
a) 3
b) 2
c) 1
d) 0
d
6. Find the divergence of the vector F= xe-x i + y j – xz k
a) (1 – x)(1 + e-x)
b) (x – 1)(1 + e-x)
c) (1 – x)(1 – e)
d) (x – 1)(1 – e)
a
e-x(1 – x) + (1 – x) = (1 – x)(1 + e-x).
7. Determine the divergence of F = 30 i + 2xy j + 5xz2 k at (1,1,-0.2) and state the nature of the field.
a) 1, solenoidal
b) 0, solenoidal
c) 1, divergent
d) 0, divergent
b
Divergence at (1,1,-0.2) will give zero. As the divergence is zero, field is solenoidal.
Alternate/Shortcut: Without calculation, we can easily choose option b, as by theory when the divergence is zero, the vector is solenoidal. Option b is the only one which is satisfying this condition. 
8. Find whether the vector is solenoidal, E = yz i + xz j + xy k
a) Yes, solenoidal
b) No, non-solenoidal
c) Solenoidal with negative divergence
d) Variable divergence
a
9. Find the divergence of the field, P = x2yz i + xz k
a) xyz + 2x
b) 2xyz + x
c) xyz + 2z
d) 2xyz + z
b
10. Identify the nature of the field, if the divergence is zero and curl is also zero.
a) Solenoidal, irrotational
b) Divergent, rotational
c) Solenoidal, irrotational
d) Divergent, rotational
