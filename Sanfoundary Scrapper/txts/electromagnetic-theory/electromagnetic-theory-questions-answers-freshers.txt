1.	Gauss theorem uses which of the following operations?
a)	Gradient
b)	Curl
c)	Divergence
d)	Laplacian
c
2.	Evaluate the surface integral ∫∫ (3x i + 2y j). dS, where S is the sphere given by x2 + y2 + z2 = 9.
a)	120π
b)	180π
c)	240π
d)	300π
b
Div (3x i + 2y j) = 3 + 2 = 5. Now the volume integral will be ∫∫∫ 5.dV, where dV is the volume of the sphere 4πr3/3 and r = 3units.Thus we get 180π.
3.	The Gauss divergence theorem converts

b)	line to volume integral
c)	surface to line integral
d)	surface to volume integral
d

d)	1
b
6.	The divergence theorem value for the function x2 + y2 + z2 at a distance of one unit from the origin is
a)	0
b)	1
c)	2
d)	3
d
7.	If a function is described by F = (3x + z, y2 − sin x2z, xz + yex5), then the divergence theorem value in the region 0<x<1, 0<y<3 and 0<z<2 will be

b)	0
c)	-1
d)	2
b
9.	For a function given by F = 4x i + 7y j +z k, the divergence theorem evaluates to which of the values given, if the surface considered is a cone of radius 1/2π m and height 4π2 m.
a)	1
b)	2
c)	3
d)	4
b
10.	Divergence theorem computes to zero for a solenoidal function. State True/False.
