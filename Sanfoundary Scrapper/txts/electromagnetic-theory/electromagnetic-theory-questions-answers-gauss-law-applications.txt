1.	Gauss law can be used to compute which of the following?
a)	Permittivity
b)	Permeability
c)	Radius of Gaussian surface
d)	Electric potential
c
2.	Three charged cylindrical sheets are present in three spaces with σ = 5 at R = 2m, σ = -2 at R = 4m and σ = -3 at R = 5m. Find the flux density at R = 1m.
a)	0
b)	1
c)	2
d)	3
a
3.	Three charged cylindrical sheets are present in three spaces with σ = 5 at R = 2m, σ = -2 at R = 4m and σ = -3 at R = 5m. Find the flux density at R = 3m.
a)	3
b)	10/3
c)	11/3
d)	4
b
By Gauss law, ψ = Q
D(2πRL) = σ(2πRL), D(2π X 3) = σ(2π X 2), Thus D = 10/3 units.
4.	Three charged cylindrical sheets are present in three spaces with σ = 5 at R = 2m, σ = -2 at R = 4m and σ =-3 at R = 5m. Find the flux density at R = 4.5m.
a)	4/4.5
b)	3/4.5
c)	2/4.5
d)	1/4.5
c
By Gauss law,  ψ = Q
D(2πRL) = σ(2πRL), D(2π X 4.5) = Q1 + Q2 =  σ1(2π X 2) + σ2(2π X 4), here σ1 = 5 and σ2 = -2. We get D = 2/4.5 units.

5.	Three charged cylindrical sheets are present in three spaces with σ = 5 at R = 2m, σ = -2 at R = 4m and σ = -3 at R = 5m. Find the flux density at R = 6m.
a)	17/6
b)	-17/6
c)	13/6
d)	-13/6
d
By Gauss law,  ψ = Q
D(2πRL) = σ(2πRL), D(2π X 6) = Q1 + Q2 + Q3 =  σ1(2π X 2) + σ2(2π X 4) + σ3(2π X 5), here σ1 = 5, σ2 = -2 and σ3 = -3. We get D = -13/6 units.
