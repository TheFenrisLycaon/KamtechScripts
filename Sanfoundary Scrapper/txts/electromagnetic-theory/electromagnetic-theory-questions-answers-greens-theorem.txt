b)	2
c)	-2
d)	1
c
6.	If two functions A and B are discrete, their Green’s value for a region of circle of radius a in the positive quadrant is
a)	∞
b)	-∞
c)	0
d)	Does not exist
d
7.	Applications of Green’s theorem are meant to be in
a)	One dimensional
b)	Two dimensional
c)	 Three dimensional
d)	Four dimensional
b
8.	The Green’s theorem can be related to which of the following theorems mathematically?
a)	Gauss divergence theorem
b)	Stoke’s theorem
c)	Euler’s theorem
d)	Leibnitz’s theorem
b
9.	The Shoelace formula is a shortcut for the Green’s theorem. State True/False.
a)	True
b)	False
a
10.	 Find the area of a right angled triangle with sides of 90 degree unit and the functions described by L = cos y and M = sin x.
a)	0
b)	45
c)	90
d)	180
d
∫∫(dM/dx – dL/dy)dx dy = ∫∫ (cos x + sin y)dx dy. On integrating with x = 0->90 and y = 0->90, we get area of right angled triangle as -180 units (taken in clockwise direction). Since area cannot be negative, we take 180 units.
