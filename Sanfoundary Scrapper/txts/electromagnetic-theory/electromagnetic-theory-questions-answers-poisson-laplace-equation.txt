1.	The given equation satisfies the Laplace equation.
V = x2 + y2 – z2. State True/False.
a)	True
b)	False
a
2.	In free space, the Poisson equation becomes
a)	Maxwell equation
b)	Ampere equation
c)	Laplace equation
d)	Steady state equation
c
3.	If Laplace equation satisfies, then which of the following statements will be true?
a)	Potential will be zero
b)	Current will be infinite
c)	Resistance will be infinite
d)	Voltage will be same
b
4.	Suppose the potential function is a step function. The equation that gets satisfied is
a)	Laplace equation
b)	Poisson equation
c)	Maxwell equation
d)	Ampere equation
a
5.	Calculate the charge density when a potential function x2 + y2 + z2 is in air(in 10-9 order)
a)	1/6π
b)	6/2π
c)	12/6π
d)	10/8π
a
6.	The function V = exsin y + z does not satisfy Laplace equation. State True/False.
a)	True
b)	False
b
7.	Poisson equation can be derived from which of the following equations?
a)	Point form of Gauss law
b)	Integral form of Gauss law
c)	Point form of Ampere law
d)	Integral form of Ampere law
a
D= ε E and E=- Grad (V) in Gauss law, we get Del2 (V)= -ρ/ε, which is the Poisson equation. 
8.	Find the charge density from the function of flux density given by 12x – 7z.
a)	19
b)	-5
c)	5
d)	-19
c
Div (D) = Div(12x – 7z) = 12-7 = 5, which the charge density ρv. Thus ρv = 5 units.
9.	Find the electric field of a potential function given by 20 log x + y at the point (1,1,0).
a)	-20 i – j
b)	-i -20 j
c)	i + j
d)	(i + j)/20
a
10.	 When a material has zero permittivity, the maximum potential that it can possess is
a)	∞
b)	-∞
c)	Unity
d)	Zero
d
