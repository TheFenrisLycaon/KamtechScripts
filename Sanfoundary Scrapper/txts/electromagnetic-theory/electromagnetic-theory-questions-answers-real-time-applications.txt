5.	Find the current in a conductor with resistance 2 ohm, electric field 2 units and distance 100cm.
a)	1A
b)	10mA
c)	10A
d)	100mA
a
6.	In electric fields, D= ε E. The correct expression which is analogous in magnetic fields will be
a)	H = μ B
b)	B = μ H
c)	A = μ B
d)	H = μ A
b
7.	Find the force on a conductor of length 12m and magnetic flux density 20 units when a current of 0.5A is flowing through it.
a)	60
b)	120
c)	180
d)	200
b
8.	From the formula F = qE, can prove that work done is a product of force and displacement. State True/False
a)	True
b)	False
a
9.	Calculate the power of a material with electric field 100 units at a distance of 10cm with a current of 2A flowing through it.
a)	 10
b)	20
c)	40
d)	80
b
P = V X I, where V = E X d. Thus P = E X d X I = 100 X 0.1 X 2 = 20 units.
10.	 Compute the power consumed by a material with current density 15 units in an area of 100 units. The potential measured across the material is 20V.
a)	100kJ
b)	250kJ
c)	30kJ
d)	15kJ
c
Thus power P = V X J X A = 20 X 15 X 100 = 30,000 joule = 30kJ.
