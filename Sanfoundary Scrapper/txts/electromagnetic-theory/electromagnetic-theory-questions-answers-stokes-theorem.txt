1.	Find the value of Stoke’s theorem for y i + z j + x k.
a)	i + j
b)	j + k
c)	i + j + k
d)	–i – j – k
d
-i –j –k. Since the curl is zero, the value of Stoke’s theorem is zero. The function is said to be irrotational.
2.	The Stoke’s theorem uses which of the following operation?
a)	Divergence
b)	Gradient
c)	Curl
d)	Laplacian
c
3.	Which of the following theorem convert line integral to surface integral?
a)	Gauss divergence and Stoke’s theorem
b)	Stoke’s theorem only
c)	Green’ s theorem only
d)	Stoke’s and Green’s theorem
d
4.	Find the value of Stoke’s theorem for A = x i + y j + z k. The state of the function will be
a)	Solenoidal
b)	Divergent
c)	Rotational
d)	Curl free
.
5.	The Stoke’s theorem can be used to find which of the following?
a)	Area enclosed by a function in the given region
b)	Volume enclosed by a function in the given region
c)	Linear distance
d)	Curl of the function
a
6.	The energy stored in an inductor 2H and current 4A is
a)	4
b)	8
c)	12
d)	16
d
7.	The voltage of a capacitor 12F with a rating of 2J energy is
a)	0.57
b)	5.7
c)	57
d)	570
a
8.	Find the power, given energy E = 2J and current density J = x2 varies from x = 0 and x = 1.
a)	1/3
b)	2/3
c)	1
d)	4/3
b
= 2∫ x2 dx as x = 0->1. We get P = 2/3 units.
9.	The conductivity of a material with current density 1 unit and electric field 200 μV is
