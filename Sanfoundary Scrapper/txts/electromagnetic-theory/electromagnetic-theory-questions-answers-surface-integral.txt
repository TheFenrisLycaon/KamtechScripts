b) Area
c) Volume
d) density
b
3. Coulomb’s law can be derived from Gauss law. State True/ False
a) True
b) False
a
By considering area of a sphere, ds = r2sin θ dθ dφ.
On integrating, we get Q = 4πr2D and D = εE, where E = F/Q.
Thus, we get Coulomb’s law F = Q1 x Q2/4∏εR2.
4. Evaluate Gauss law for D = 5r2/4 i in spherical coordinates with r = 4m and θ = π/2.
a) 600
b) 599.8
c) 588.9
d) 577.8
c
Put r = 4m and substitute θ = 0→ π/4 and φ = 0→ 2π, the integral evaluates to 588.9.
