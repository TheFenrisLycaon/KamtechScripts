1. Which is the common method to relate higher calorific value to lower calorific value?
a) HCV = LCV + HV (nH2O, out / nfuel, in)
b) LCV = HCV + HV (nH2O, out / nfuel, in)
c) HCV = LCV + HV (nfuel, in/ nH2O, out)
d) LCV = HCV + HV (nfuel, in/ nH2O, out)
a
                       nH2O, out  – moles of water vaporized.
                       nfuel, in    – number of moles of fuel combusted.
High calorific value is equal to low calorific value plus, product of heat of vaporization of water and moles of water vaporized by moles of fuel combusted.
2. Based on what basis are fuels compared?
a) Fire point value
b) High calorific value
c) Flash point value
d) Low calorific value
d
3. Which value is determined by bringing all products of combustion back to original pre-combustion temperature?
a) Higher calorific value
b) Low calorific value
c) Flash point value
d) Fire point value
a
4. Which calorific value is same as the thermodynamic heat of combustion?
a) Net calorific value
b) Flash point value
c) Gross calorific value
d) Fire point value
d
5. Which value is determined by subtracting the heat of vaporization of the water from the higher heating value?
a) Gross calorific value
b) Net calorific value
c) Ignition temperature
d) Fire point temperature
b
6. Which formula is used to determine higher calorific value of fuel?
a) Rayleigh’s formula
b) Lamme’s equation
c) Dulongs’s formula
d) Cauchy’s formula
c
                                                     HCV = 1/100 [33900 + 144000(H – (O/8)) + 9295 S] kJ/Kg
 This formula gives gross heating value in terms of the weight fractions of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and sulfur from the ultimate analysis. 
7. Lower calorific value can be determined by equation:
a) LCV = HCV – m*2466
b) LCV = HCV + (m/2466)
c) LCV = HCV – (m/2466)
d) LCV = HCV + (m*2466)
a
                                    m = mass of water vapour formed per kg of fuel burnt. 
8. Which fuel has higher calorific value among given fuels?
a) Natural gas
b) Gasoline
c) Diesel
d) Fuel oil
b
9. What is amount of minimum air required per kg of liquid fuel for complete combustion using carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur?
a) 1/23 [8/3 C + 8(H – (O/8)) + S] 
b) 1/100 [8/3 C + 8(H – (O/8)) + S] 
c) 1/100 [8/3 C + 8(H – (0/8))] 
d) 1/23 [8/3 C + 8(H – (0/8))] 
a
The mass of oxygen required for complete combustion of fuel is given by,
                                         = 1/100 [8/3 C + 8H – O + S] 
                                         = 1/100 [8/3C + 8(H – (0/8)) + S] 
 As air contains 23% of oxygen by mass, minimum air required for burning one kg of liquid fuel completely is given by,
            Min. air required = 1/100 [8/3 C + 8(H – (O/8)) + S] 100/23
                                            = 1/23 [8/3 C + 8 (H – (O/8)) + S].
10. What is minimum amount of air required per m3 of gaseous fuel for complete combustion?
a)  1/21 [(H2/2) + (CO/2) + 2CH4 + 3C2H4] m3/m3 of fuel
b) 1/100 [(H2/2) + (CO/2) + 2CH4 + 3C2H4] m3/m3 of fuel
c) 1/21 [(H2/2) + (CO/2) + 3C2H4] m3/m3 of fuel
d) 1/100 [(H2/2) + (CO/2) + 3C2H4] m3/m3 of fuel
a
               O2 required/m3 of fuel = 1/100[(H2/2) + (CO/2) + 2CH4 + 3C2H4] m3
As atmospheric air contains 21% of O2 by volume, minimum air required t burn one m3 of gaseous fuel is given by,
    Minimum volume of air required (cm3/m3 of fuel):
               = 1/100 [(H2/2) + (CO/2) + 2CH4 + 3C2H4] 100/21
               = 1/21 [(H2/2) + (CO/2) + 2CH4 + 3C2H4] m3/m3 of fuel.
