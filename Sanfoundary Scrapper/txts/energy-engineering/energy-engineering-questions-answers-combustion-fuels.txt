b) Auto ignition
c) Ignition temperature
d) Flash point temperature
c
3. The substance which helps in combustion of fuels is called _________
a) Igniter
b) Flammables
c) Supporter
d) Inflammables
c
4. What is necessary for complete combustion of fuels?
a) There should be no water content in the fuel
b) Sufficient amount of air is required
c) High quantity of fuel
d) Open space to burn easily
b
5. C + O2 →_____
a) CO
b) CO2
c) CO3
d) 2CO
b
              i.e., 12kg of C + 32 kg of O2 => 44kg of CO2
              1kg of C + 8/3kg of O2 => 11/3kg of CO2
              Reaction type: synthesis. 
6. C + O2 => _______
a) CO
b) 2CO2
c) 2CO
d) CO3
c
 Oxygen is left in excess, based on the molecular weight, 24kg of carbon combines with 32kg of oxygen forming 56kg of carbon monoxide
                                24kg of C + 32kg of O2 => 56kg of CO
                                1kg of C + 4/3kg of O2 => 7/3kg of CO. 
7. CO + O2 => _______
a) 2CO2
b) CO2
c) CO
d) CO3
a
                                 Balanced equation: 2CO + O2 => 2CO2
                                 56kg of CO + 32kg of O2 => 88kg of CO2
                                 1kg of CO + 4/7kg of O2 => 11/7kg of CO2.  
8. H2 + O2 => _____
a) H2O
b) OH
c) H3O
d) 2H2O
d
                                 Balanced equation: 2H2 + O2 => 2H2O
                                 4kg of H2 + 32kg of O2 => 36kg of H2O
                                 1kg of H2 + 8kg of O2 => 9kg of H2O.  
9. S + O2 => ______
a) SO3
b) SO2
c) S2-
d) 2SO2
b
                         S + O2 => SO2
                        32 kg of S + 3 2 kg of O2 => 64 kg of SO2
                       1 kg of S + 1 kg of O2 => 2 kg of SO2.
