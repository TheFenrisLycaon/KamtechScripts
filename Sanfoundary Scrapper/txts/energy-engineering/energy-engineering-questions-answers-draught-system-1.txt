1. Why boiler draught is most essential part of the thermal plants?
a) Serves combustion by supplying ample amount of air
b) Helps in maintaining air ventilation
c) Required to maintain constant air flow
d) Stabilizes the boiler system
c
2. Which is the correct formula of total draught loss?
a) Ht = Hv + Hb + Hc + Hcd
b) Ht = Hv + Hb – Hc + Hcd
c) Ht = Hv – Hb + Hc + Hcd
d) Ht = Hv – Hb – Hc – Hcd
a
Total draught loss = Velocity head loss at the chimney exit + fuel bed resistance + head loss in
Equipment’s like economizer, air heater etc. + head loss in chimney and ducts
                            i.e.,     Ht = Hv + Hb + Hc + Hcd 
3. By what is natural draught produced?
a)  Air duct
b)  Chimney
c)  Locomotive exhaust
d)  Air blower
b
4. Which of the following given below as the affect on amount natural draught?
a)  Boiler operation
b)  Size of the furnace
c)  Grade of the fuel

a
5. When is artificial draught preferred?
a) When quick evacuation of flue gases is required
b) When we choose large power plant systems
c) When draught produced by chimney is not sufficient
d) When there are many components inside the boiler
c
6. Artificial draught is also called as _______
a) Force draught
b) Induced draught
c) Balanced draught
d) Mechanical draught
d
7. What is installed to transfer air into furnace in forced draught system?

d) By installing air preheater and economizer along the gas path
d
10. Which is most preferred type of draught system?
a) Chimney draught

c) Force draught
d) Balanced draught
d
11. How pressure in the furnace is maintained below atmospheric pressure in balanced draught system?

a) Natural draught system
b) Balanced draught system
c) Forced draught system
d) Induced Steam draught system
d
13. Which draught system is also known as turbine draught?
a) Forced steam draught
b) Induced steam draught
c) Natural draught
d) Fan draught
a
14. Which draught system is used as conjunction with chimney draught?
a) Forced steam draught
b) Forced draught
c) Induced draught
d) Balanced draught
