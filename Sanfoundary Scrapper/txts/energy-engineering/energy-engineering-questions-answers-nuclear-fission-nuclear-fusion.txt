2. Heavy nuclei must be such that they can be fissioned by neutrons of an energy such substance are called?
a) Fission fragments
b) Fission Neutrons
c) Fission species
d) Fission elements

10. How many number of nuclei of hydrogen fuse in a series of reaction involving other particles that continually appear and disappear?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
d
				41H1 → 2He4 + 2+1e0 (Positrons)
Mass decreases to about 0.0276amu releasing 25.7MeV. The heat liberated during this result in temperature of the order of the million degrees and sustains the succeeding reactions.
