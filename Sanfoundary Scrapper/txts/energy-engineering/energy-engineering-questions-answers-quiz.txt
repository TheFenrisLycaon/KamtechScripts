1. Which is the net pressure equation used to find chimney height?
a) P = H (Wa-Wg)
b) P = H (Wa+Wg)
c) P = H (Wg-Wa)
d) P = H (\(\frac{W_a}{W_g}\))
a
                          P1 = Pa + Wg H
                       Pressure acting on the grate from atmospheric side
                         P2 = Pa + Wa H
                        Where, Pa = Atm pressure
                                      Wa = weight density of air
                                      Wg = Weight density of hot gases
 The net pressure acting on the combustion chamber due to the pressure exerted by gas column and air column is given by
                                 P = P2  – P1  (as Wa  > Wg )
                                 P = (pa + Wa H) – (Pa  + Wa H)
                                 P = H (Wa  – Wg )
This pressure difference is known as static draught and is responsible for causing the flow of air through the chimney.
