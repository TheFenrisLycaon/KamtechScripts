c
7. How many types of Boiling water reactor cycles are there?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
b
	Single cycle internal circulation: This system uses internal recirculation system to generate power ranging from 50- 100 MW.
	Single cycle forced circulation: This type uses a forced circulation system using a circulation system using a circulating pump. The heat in the reactor is used to generate steam.
	Dual cycle forced circulation: this arrangement has two cycles, steam cycle and gas cycle.
