1. How many years of minimum rainfall is required to design hydroelectric projects?
a) 10
b) 20
c) 25
d) 35
d
2. There is requirement for wind shelter to reduce wind effect at rain gauge area.
a) True
b) False
a
3.  What is the primary intention of rain gauging in hydro electric plant?
a) To determine force of storm
b) To determine monthly rainfall
c) To determine annual rainfall
d) To determine monthly and annual rainfall
d
4. How many methods are used to determine the average rainfall depending upon area of basin in rain gauging?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
b
5. In which of the following rain gauging methods are the values of rainfalls of all stations added?
a) Arithmetic mean method
b) Thiesson method
c) Iso-hyetol method
d) Recording type
a

6. Which among the following method is very accurate of rain gauging?
a) Arithmetic mean method
b) Thiesson method
c) Iso-hyetol method
d) Recording type
b
7. Thiesson method is better result than arithmetic mean method because _________
a) It is shorter time consuming
b) Gives better detail about records
c) It is highly accurate
d) Small procedure
c
		ha = \(\frac{h1A1 + h2A2 + h3A3 + h4A4 + h5A5  + h6A6 + h7A7 + h8A8}{A1+A2+A3+A4+A5+A6+A7+A8}\) 
This method gives better result than arithmetic mean method because it is very accurate and each point on a perpendicular bisector of the line joining the two gauging stations will be equidistant from both the stations. If one moves slightly this or that side of the bisector, the position will distinctly fall in the domain of that station of which ones position is now near.
8. In which of the following rain gauging method is contour joining the points of equal rainfall is done?
a) Arithmetic mean method
b) Thiesson method
c) Iso-hyetol method
d) Recording type
c
i) Two different iso-hyetes do not cross each other.
ii) Each iso-hyete closes on itself.
iii) Iso-hyete of higher value indicates the higher rainfall.
9. Two successive Iso-hyetes in the basin drawing of catchment area are measured using _______
a) Planimeter
b) Manometer
c) Mass flow meter
d) Chronometer
a
10. Iso-hyete method is commonly used for the basin area above 500sq.km.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Study of shape and features of earth surface is called __________
a) Vegetation
b) Geography
c) Anatomy
d) Topography
d
12. Vegetation affects the runoff.
a) True
b) False
a
13. Rocky area gives higher runoff than sandy area.
a) True
b) False
a
14. The runoff calculated from the rainfall data available for sufficiently long period by multiplying with a coefficient is known as _________
a) Runoff coefficient
b) Rainfall coefficient
c) Topographic coefficient
d) Geo coefficient
a
15. The maximum rate of flow through the river is calculated by _________
a) Energy curves of flow
b) Force of flow
c) Pressure of flow
d) Head of flow
a
