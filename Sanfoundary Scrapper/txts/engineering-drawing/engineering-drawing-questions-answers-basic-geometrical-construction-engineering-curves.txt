3. Arrange the following stages in a sequence, such that they result in an ogee curve between two parallel lines AB and CD, such that they are the tangents to the arc.
m) Join the adjacent ends B and C with a straight line.
n) Divide the line BC into four parts using the points P1, P2, P3.
o) Draw lines such that they pass through the points P1, P2, P3, and are perpendicular to the line BC.
p) Draw the perpendicular lines through the points B and C such that they cut the lines passing through P1, P3 respectively at E and F.
