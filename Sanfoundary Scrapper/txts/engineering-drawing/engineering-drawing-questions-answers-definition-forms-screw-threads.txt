a
10. A screw thread designation is given by, M12 x 1.3. What does that indicate?
a) A marvelous thread of 12mm nominal diameter with 1.3 pitch
b) A metric thread of 12mm pitch with 1.3mm nominal diameter
c) A marvelous thread of 12mm pitch with 1.3mm nominal diameter
d) A metric thread of 12mm nominal diameter with 1.3 pitch
d
11. Pitch diameter is the diameter of the imaginary circle passing through the points where the thread width is equal to ______
a) Pitch
b) lead
c) space between the threads
d) approximately zero
c
12. B.I.S recommends only fine threads.
a) True
b) False
b
13. What will be the basic triangle height for the screw thread profile of thread angle 60° and pitch 1.25?
a) 2.08
b) 1.08
c) 0.08
d) 3.08
b
From the figure, it is clear tan (30°) = (P/2)/H
Hence H = (√3/2)P.
