6. When two shafts are not coaxial which type of couplings are used?
a) Rigid couplings
b) Flexible couplings
c) Dis-engaging couplings
d) Non-aligned couplings
d
Explanations: When two shafts axes are not coaxial then non-flanged couplings are used. Universal couplings cushion coupling, and Oldham couplings are non-flanged coupling types.
7. ______________ couplings allow the relative rotation or any changes in the alignments of the shafts to a certain limit.
a) Rigid couplings
b) Muff couplings
c) Flexible couplings
d) Flanged couplings
c
8. Find the type of coupling the following diagram is representing.
a) Butt muff coupling
b) Bush pin coupling
c) Split muff coupling
d) Half lap coupling
d
9. In compression couplings, friction between the shafts and sleeves aids in power transmission.
a) True
b) False
a
10. In which of the following couplings, two forks, which are keyed to the shafts, are pin joined to a central block.
a) Rigid coupling
b) Muff coupling
c) Flanged coupling
c) Universal coupling
d
11. Which of the coupling is used to couple the two shafts which are parallel to each other and the axes of shafts are separated by a distance.
a) Muff couplings
b) Cone couplings
c) Claw coupling
d) Oldham coupling
d
12. Application of Oldham couplings should be free from backlash.
a) True
b) False
a
13. The H.P rating for the cushion coupling is ________
a) 0.2 to 1
b) 100 to 450
c) 0.2 to 450
