1. Which of the following statement is incorrect with regard to plain scales?
a) Plain scales represent two units
b) Zero should be placed between the units and its subdivisions
c) The representative factor should be mentioned below the scale

d
2. The relation between main scale division (M.S.D) and Vernier scale division (V.S.D) for backward Vernier scale is _______
a) n*V.S.D = (n-2)*M.S.D
b) n*M.S.D = (n-1)*V.S.D
c) n*M.S.D = (n-2)*V.S.D
d) n*V.S.D = (n+1)*M.S.D
d
3. How do we calculate least count (L.C) for a forward Vernier?
a) L.C = 1V.S.D – 1M.S.D
b) L.C = (V.S.D/n)
c) L.C = M.S.D/(n+1)
d) L.C = V.S.D/(n-1)
d
4. Diagonal scales can only measure the first decimal place of measurement.
a) False
b) True
a
5. Put the statements in an order to divide the line AB into 10 parts using the principle of diagonal scales.
i. Number the division-points as 1, 2, 3, up to 9 starting from C and later join AC.
ii. Divide the line BC into 10 equal parts.
iii. Draw a perpendicular line BC TO the line AB.
iv. Hence 9’9 is 0.9AB and similarly, other 2’2 is 0.2AB.
v. Number the cutting points on AC as 1’, 2’, 3’ and so on up to 9’.
vi. Draw lines parallel to AB through the division-points.
a) i, iv, v, ii, vi, iii
b) i, v, vi, ii, iv, iii
c) iii, ii, i, vi, v, iv
d) i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi
c

c
7. Which of the following is used to measure angles accurately in surveying?
a) Plain scales
b) Diagonal scales
c) Circular Vernier scales
d) Comparative scales
c
8. How can we decide the minimum length of a scale, when Representative factor (R.F) and the maximum length of measurement (L) are known?
a) Length of scale = R.F+L
b) Length of scale = R.F/L
c) Length of scale = R.F-L
d) Length of scale = R.F*L
d
9. When the value of one Vernier scale division is less than one it is called as forward Vernier.
a) True
b) False
a
