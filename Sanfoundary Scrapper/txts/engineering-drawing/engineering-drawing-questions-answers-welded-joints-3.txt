10. What does the letter a indicate in the fillet weld dimensioning?
a) cross-section
b) longitudinal dimension
c) throat thickness
d) leg length
c
11. What does the letter z indicate in the fillet weld dimensioning?
a) cross-section
b) longitudinal dimension
c) throat thickness
d) leg length
d
12. From the given dimension find the throat thickness of the fillet weld?
a) 5
b) 7.07
c) 200
d) 1000
a
13. From the given dimension find the throat leg thickness of the fillet weld?
a) 5
b) 7.07
c) 200
d) 1000
b
calculated, 
From the figure, we know that Z = a*√2, hence z = 5*1.414 which equals to 7.07units.
