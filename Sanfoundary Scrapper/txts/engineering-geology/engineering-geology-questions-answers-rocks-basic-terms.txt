1. The branch of geology which deals with the morphology, classification, mechanism and causes of development of these rock structures is called as ___________
a) Rock geology
b) Structural geology
c) Basic geology
d) Lithology
b
2. Stratification can be seen widely in which of the following rocks?
a) Igneous rocks
b) Metamorphic rocks
c) Sedimentary rocks
d) Fossil rocks
c
3. Outcrop is seen on land everywhere on earth.
a) True
b) False
b
4. Most widespread rock on earth is _____________
a) Igneous rock
b) Sedimentary rock
c) Metamorphic rock
d) All are in equal quantities

6. The maximum angle of inclination of a layer of a rock with the horizontal is _____________
a) Dip
b) Heave angle
c) Strike
d) Depth
a
7. Angle of dip is measured using which instrument?
a) Compass
b) Theodolite
c) Tacheometer
d) Clinometer
d
8. Which among the following is not a type of dip?
a) Widespread dip
b) Primary dip
c) Secondary dip
d) Local and regional dip
a
9. The term “intrusion” is basically associated with which type of rock?
a) Igneous rock
b) Sedimentary rock
c) Metamorphic rock
d) Not associated with any type of rock
a
10. The dip which involves tectonic forces is _____________
a) Primary dip
b) Secondary dip
c) Local and Regional dip
d) No dip involves tectonic forces
b
11. A coal seam is exposed on a horizontal ground. If it is 30° towards West. Its width of outcrop on a level ground is 360 m. What is its true thickness?
a) 120 m
b) 150 m
c) 160 m
d) 180 m
d
True thickness = Width of outcrop * Sin 30°
By substitution and calculation, we get 180 m.
True thickness = 360 * sin (30°) = 180 m 
12. At a dam site, a bed of sandstone is exposed on horizontal ground. If it is 25° towards East. Its width of outcrop on a level ground is 240 m, what is its vertical thickness?
a) 101.9 m
b) 99.9 m
c) 111.9 m
d) 121.9 m
c
Vertical thickness = 240 * tan (25°) = 111.91 m 
13. The study of outcrop dimensions doesn’t involve which of the following aspect?
a) Width
b) Thickness and depth
c) Dip and strike
d) Rock composition and type
d
14. Foliation is a primary structure of which type of rock?
a) Igneous rock
b) Sedimentary rock
c) Metamorphic rock
d) Not associated with any rock
c
15. The dip of a layer measured in the direction that is at the right angle to strike is _____________
a) True dip
b) Apparent dip
c) Straight dip
d) Normal dip
a
