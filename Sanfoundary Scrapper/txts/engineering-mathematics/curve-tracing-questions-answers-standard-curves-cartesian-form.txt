a
Cartesian Equation: \(y^2=\frac{x^3}{(2a-x)} \) 
Polar Equation: r=2a*tanθ*sinθ
3. Which of the following represents the graph of Cissoid of Diocles?
a)
b)
c)
d)
c
4. Which of the following represents the correct cartesian equation for Lemniscate of Bernoulli?
a) (x2+y2)2=2a2 (x2-y2)
b) (x2+y)2=2a2 (x2-y2)
c) (x2+y2)2=2(x2-y2)
d) (x2+y2)2=a2 (x2-y2)
a
Cartesian Equation: (x2+y2)2=2a2 (x2-y2)
Polar Equation: r2=2a2*cos2θ
5. The polar coordinates of strophoid is given by
\(r=f(θ)±\sqrt{(f(θ)cosθ-a)^2+(f(θ)sinθ-b)^2}. \) 
a) False
b) True
b
6. What are the tangents to the curve y2=4ax at the origin?
a) x=0
b) x=0, y=0
c) y=0
d) x=y
a
To find the tangent to the curve at the origin, we need to equate the lowest degree term to 0.
Therefore, 4ax=0, which gives x=0.
7. At the point where \(\frac{dy}{dx}=∞,\) the tangent is parallel to y axis.
a) False
b) True
b
8. Which of the following is not correct regarding Folium of Descartes?
a) The equation is third degree in both x and y
b) Its asymptote is given by x+y+a=0
c) It is symmetrical about y = x
d) It forms a loop in the second quadrant
d
The Folium of Descartes is an algebraic curve defined as, x3+y3-3xy=0.
	It is symmetrical about y = x. 
	It forms a loop in the first quadrant with a double point at the origin and asymptote, x+y+a=0.
9. What is the value of the given limit, \(\lim_{x\to 0}⁡\frac{25}{x}\)?
a) 25
b) 0
c) \(\frac{1}{2}\) 
d) \(\frac{3}{2}\) 
a
Using L’Hospital’s Rule, by differentiating both the numerator and denominator with respect to x,
\(\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{25}{1} = 25.\) 
10. Vertical asymptotes are parallel to both x and y axes.
a) True
b) False
b
