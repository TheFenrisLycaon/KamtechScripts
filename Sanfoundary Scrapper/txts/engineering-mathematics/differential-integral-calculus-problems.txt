a) Centroid
b) Astroid
c) Asteroid
d) Cycloid
b

a) Reciprocal of radius of curvature
b) Radius of Curvature
c) Twice the radius of curvature
d) One
a
3. Involute is also known as ___________
a) Evolute
b) Evolvent
c) Envelope
d) Tangent
b
4. What is the evolute of parabola called?
a) Cycloid
b) Spiral
c) Congruent parabola
d) Semicubical parabola
d
x=t2  and y=at3.
5. Definition of evolute of a curve is ___________
a) locus of centre of the given curve
b) locus of centre of tangential curve
c) locus of circumferential point on the curve
d) locus of tangent to the curve
a
6. What is the curvature of the curve x2 + y2 = 25?
a) 5
b) 25
c) 0.5
d) 0.2
d
7. What is the curvature of straight line?
a) infinity
b) one
c) zero
d) length of the straight line
c
8. Number of possible evolutes for a curve is   ____________
a) Two
b) Equal to radius
c) One
d) Infinity
c
9. The curvature of a plane curve at K is _________
a) one
b)  d ψ/ds
c) zero
d) infinity
b
10. What is the radius of curvature of the curve xy = c2 at (c,c)?
a) c
b) 2
c) 2c
d) √2 c
d
Integrating,
\(y_1 = \frac{-c^2}{x^2} = \frac{-c^2}{c^2} = -1\) 
\(y_2 = \frac{2c^2}{x^3} =  \frac{2c^2}{c^3} = \frac{2}{c}\) 
Radius of curvature = \(\frac{\left(1+y_{1}^{2}\right)^\frac{3}{2}}{y_2} = \frac{\left(1+1\right)^\frac{3}{2}}{\frac{2}{c}} = \frac{c.2^{\frac{3}{2}}}{2} = \sqrt{2}c.\)
