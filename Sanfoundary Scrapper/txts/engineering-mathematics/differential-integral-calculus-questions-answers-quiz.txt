1. Envelope of a family of curves can be defined as __________
a) A curve which touches 50% of the family of curves
b) A curve which is a straight line
c) A curve which touches each member of the family of curves
d) A curve which surrounds the family of curves
c
2. Do concentric circles have an envelope?
a) Yes
b) No
b
3. What is the relation between evolutes and envelopes?
a) Evolutes and envelopes are same
b) Evolute is the envelope of normals to a curve
c) Evolute is the envelope of tangents to a curve
d) Envelope is the evolute of normal to a curve
b
4. Find the envelope of the family of lines \(\frac{x}{t} \) + yt = 2c, t being the parameter.
a) xy = c
b) xy = 2c
c) xy = 2
d) xy = c2
d
The envelope of At2 + Bt + C = 0 is B2 – 4AC = 0 ———> eq(2)
From eq(1), A = y, B= -2c, C = x
Putting the values in eq(2),
(-2c)2 – 4(y)(x) = 0
4c2 – 4xy = 0
xy = c2.

5. What is the envelope of the family of straight lines y = mx +\(\frac{a}{m} \), m is the parameter?
a) y = 4ax
b) y2 = 4ax
c) x = 4ay
d) x2 = 4ay
b
The envelope is given by B2 – 4AC = 0 ——> eq(2)
From eq(1), A = x , B = -y , C = a
Putting the values in eq(2),
(-y)2 – 4(x)(a) = 0
 y2 = 4ax.
6. What is the envelope of straight lines given by x cos b + y sin b = a sec b, where b is the parameter?
a) y2 + 4a(a-x) = 0
b) y + 4ax = 0
c) y + 4a(a-x) = 0
d) y2 = 4a(a-x)
d
x + y tan b = a \(\frac{sec⁡b}{cos⁡b}\) = a sec2 b = a(1 + tan2 b)
The above equation can be written as   a tan2 b – y tan b + (a-x) = 0 which is a quadratic equation in tan b
Hence, A = a, B = -y, C = a-x
The envelope is B2 – 4AC = 0
(-y)2 – 4(a)(a-x) = 0
y2 = 4a(a-x).
