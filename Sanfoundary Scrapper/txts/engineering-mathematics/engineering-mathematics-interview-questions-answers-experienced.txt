1. Mean Value Theorem tells about the
a) Existence of point c in a curve where slope of a tangent to curve is equal to the slope of line joining two points in which curve is continuous and differentiable
b) Existence of point c in a curve where slope of a tangent to curve is equal to zero
c) Existence of point c in a curve where curve meets y axis
d) Existence of point c in a curve where curve meets x axis
a
2. If f(a) is euquals to f(b) in Mean Value Theorem, then it becomes
a) Lebniz Theorem
b) Rolle’s Theorem
c) Taylor Series of a function
d) Leibnit’x Theorem
b
f’(c)= [f(b)-f(a)]/(b-a).
Hence, By putting f(b) = f(a) in the statement of Mean Value Theorem, we get
f’(c) = [f(b)-f(a)]/(b-a) = 0. Which is a statement of Rolle’s Theorem.
3. Mean Value theorem is applicable to the
a) Functions differentiable in closed interval [a, b] and continuous in open interval (a, b)
b) Functions continuous in closed interval [a, b] only and having same value at point ‘a’ and ‘b’
c) Functions continuous in closed interval [a, b] and differentiable in open interval (a, b)
d) Functions differentiable in open interval (a, b) only and having same value at point ‘a’ and ‘b’
c
4. Mean Value theorem is also known as
a) Rolle’s Theorem
b) Lagrange’s Theorem
c) Taylor Expansion
4) Leibnitz’s Theorem
b
It is also known as Lagrange’s Theorem.
5. Find the point c in the curve f(x) = x3 + x2 + x + 1 in the interval [0, 1] where slope of a tangent to a curve is equals to the slope of a line joining (0,1)
a) 0.64
b) 0.54
c) 0.44
d) 0.34
b
f(x) is continuous in given interval [0,1].
f’(x) = 3x2+2x+1
Since, value of f’(x) is always finite in interval (0, 1) it is differentiable in interval (0, 1).
f(0) = 1
f(1) = 4
By mean value theorem,
f’(c) = 3c2 + 2c + 1 = (4-1)/(1-0) = 3
⇒ c = 0.548,-1.215
Since c belongs to (0, 1) c = 0.54.
6. Find the equation of curve whose roots gives the point which lies in the curve f(x) = xSin(x) in the interval [0, π⁄2] where slope of a tangent to a curve is equals to the slope of a line joining (0, π⁄2)
a) c = -Sec(c) – Tan(c)
b) c = -Sec(c) – Tan(c)
c) c = Sec(c) +Tan(c)
d) c = Sec(c) – Tan(c)
d
Since f1(x) = x and f2(x)=Sin(x) both are continuous in interval [0, π⁄2], the curve f(x)=f1(x)f2(x) is also continuous.
f’(x) = xCos(x) + Sin(x)
f’(x) always have finite value in interval [0, π⁄2] hence it is differentiable in interval (0, π⁄2).
f(0) = 0
f(π⁄2) = π⁄2
By mean value theorem,
f’(c) = cCos(c) + Sin(c) = (π⁄2 – 0)/(π⁄2 – 0)=1
Hence, c = Sec(c) – Tan(c) is the required curve.
7. Can Mean Value Theorem be applied in the curve
f(x)=\(\begin{cases}3sin(x)&0<x<\pi/4 \\ sin(x)-cos(x)&\pi/4<x<\pi/2\end{cases}\) 
a) True
b) False
b
\(\lim_{x\rightarrow π/4-}f(x) = 3Sin(\frac{π}{4}) = 3/\sqrt{2}\) 
\(\lim_{x\rightarrow π/4+)}f(x) = Sin(π/4)- Cos(π/4) = 0\) 
Since \(\lim_{x\rightarrowπ/4+} ≠ \lim_{x\rightarrowπ/4-}\) 
Function f(x) is not continuous hence mean value theorem cannot be applied.
8. Find point c between [2,9] where, the slope of tangent to the function f(x)=1+\(\sqrt[3]{x-1}\) at point c is equals to the slope of a line joining point (2,f(2)) and (9,f(9)).
(Providing given function is continuous and differentiable in given interval).
a) -2.54
b) 4.56
c) 4.0
d) 4.9
b
f(2) = 2
f(9) = 3
Applying mean value theorem,
f’(c) = 1/3\(\sqrt[3]{x-1}\)(c-1)2 = [f(9)-f(2)]/(9-2) = 1/7
c = 1 &pm; (7/3)(3/2)
c = 4.56,-2.54
Since c lies in (2,9), c = 4.56.
9. Find point c between [-1,6] where, the slope of tangent to the function f(x) = x2+3x+2 at point c is equals to the slope of a line joining point (-1,f(-1)) and (6,f(6)).
(Providing given function is continuous and differentiable in given interval).
a) 2.5
b) 0.5
c) -0.5
d) -2.5
a
f(-1) = 0
f(6) = 56
Applying mean value theorem,
f’(c) = 2c+3 = [f(6)-f(-1)]/[6-(-1)] = 56/7 = 8
c = 5/2
c = 2.5.
10. If f(x) = Sin(x)Cos(x) is continuous and differentiable in interval (0, x) then
a) 1<\(\frac{Cos(x)Sin(x)}{x}\) <Sin(2x)
b) 1<\(\frac{Cos(x)Sin(x)}{x}\) <Cos(2x)
c) 1<\(\frac{Cos(x)Sin(x)}{x}\) <xCos(2x)
d) 1<\(\frac{Cos(x)Sin(x)}{x}\) <1+Cos(2x)
b
Given f(x) is continuous and differentiable in interval (0, x),
Applying mean value theorem in interval (0, x)
f’(c) = Cos(2c) = [f(x)-f(0)]/[x-0] = \(\frac{Cos(x)Sin(x)}{x}\) ……………………. (1)
Now, Given
0 < c < x
Multiplying by 2 and taking Cos, We get
1 < Cos(2c) < Cos(2x)
1 < \(\frac{Cos(x)Sin(x)}{x}\) < Cos(2x).
