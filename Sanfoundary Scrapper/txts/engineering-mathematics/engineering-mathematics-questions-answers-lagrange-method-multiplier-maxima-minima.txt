1. In a simple one-constraint Lagrange multiplier setup, the constraint has to be always one dimension lesser than the objective function.
a) True
b) False
b
2. Maximize the function x + y – z = 1 with respect to the constraint xy=36.
a) 0
b) -8
c) 8
d) No Maxima exists
d
3. Which one of these is the right formula for the Lagrange multiplier with more than one constraint?
a) ∇f = (μ)2 * ∇g1 + ∇g2
b) Cannot be applied to more than one constraint function.
c) ∇f = μ * ∇g1 + λ * ∇g2
d) ∇f = μ * ∇g1 + ∇g2
c
∇f = Σni=1 μi ∇gi
Where μi, μ2 ……..μn are appropriate constraints(scalar multiples).
4. Maximum value of a 3-d plane is to be found over a circular region. Which of the following happens if we increase the radius of the circular region.
a) Maximum value is invariant
b) Maximum value decreases
c) Maximum value increases and minimum value goes lesser
d) minimum value goes higher
c
5. Find the points on the plane x + y + z = 9 which are closest to origin.
a) (3,3,3)
b) (2,1,3)
c) (2,2,2)
d) (3,4,1)
a
compute gradient ∇f = 2x i + 2y j + 2z k
Now compute gradient of the function x + y + z = 9
which is
= i + j + k
Using Lagrange condition we have
∇f = λ . ∇g
2x i + 2y j + 2z k = λ * (i + j + k)
⇒ x = y =z
Put this back into constraint function we get
3x = 9 ⇒ (x,y,z) = (3,3,3).
6. Consider the points closest to the origin on the planes x + y + z = a.
a) The closest point travels farther as a  is increased
b) The closest point travels nearer as a  is increased
c) The closest point is independent of a as a is not there in the expression of the gradient.
d) Varies as a2, away from the origin.
a
7. The span of a Astroid is increased along both the x and y axes equally. Then the maximum value of: z = x + y along the Astroid is?
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Invariant
d) The scaling of Astroid is irrelevant
a
we can conclude that the maximum value increases.
8. The extreme value of the function f(x1, x2,….. xn)=\(\frac{x_1}{2^0}+\frac{x_2}{2^1}+……+\frac{x_n}{2^{n-1}}\) With respect to the constraint Σmi=1 (xi)2 = 1 where m always stays lesser than n and as m,n tends to infinity is?
a) 1
b) \(\frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}}\) 
c) 2
d) 1 ⁄ 2
b
\(\frac{1}{1}i_1+\frac{1}{2}i_2+\frac{1}{4}i_3+…..\infty=\lambda.(2x_1i_1+2x_2i_2+2x_3i_3+…\infty)\) 
Treating equations individually we get
\(x_1=\frac{1}{2\lambda}\) 
\(x_2=\frac{1}{4\lambda}\) 
and so on.
Putting back in constraint we get
\(1=\frac{1}{(2\lambda)^2}+\frac{1}{(4\lambda)^2}+….\infty\) 
\(1=\frac{1}{(\lambda)^2}+(\frac{1}{2^2}+\frac{1}{4^2}+\frac{1}{8^2}….\infty)\) 
\(\Rightarrow \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\) 
Hence, we get the extreme value (after putting back values of variables in the function) as
extreme value = \(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}+\frac{1}{2\sqrt[3]{3}}+\frac{1}{2\sqrt[5]{3}}+…\infty\) 
extreme value = \(\frac{\frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}}}{1-\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}}\)
