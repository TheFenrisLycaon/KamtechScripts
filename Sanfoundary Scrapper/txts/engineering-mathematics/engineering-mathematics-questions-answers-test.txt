1. Let τa [f (x)] denote the Taylor series of f (x) centered at a then the value of the expression
[ τ199 (τ121 (τ1729 (f (101729)))]3 – [τ342 (f (101729))]3 is equal to _______
a) 101729
b) 0
c) 1
d) -101729
b
τa1(τa2(…….(f(x))….)) = f(x)
Where a1, a2………….an are real numbers
Hence the value of the given expression is
= [τ199(τ121(τ1729(f(101729)))]3 – [τ342(f(101729))]3
= [f(101729)]3 – [f(101729)]3 = 0.
2. Function has the property that f(n) (x) = f(n + 2) (x) : n ≥ 1 : n ∈ N Then which of the following is the expression for f(x) in most general form.
a) x+\(\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}+…..\infty\) 
b) 1+\(\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+….\infty\) 
c) c1 \( \times cosh(x)+c_2\times sinh(x)\) 
d) cosh(x) + sinh(x)
c
f(x)=a0+a1x+a2x2+a3x3+….∞
Then we have
f(0)(0)=f(n+2)(0)
n!an=(n+2)!an+2
an+2=\(\frac{a^n}{(n+1)(n+2)}\) 
a2n=\(\frac{a_0}{(2n)!}\) 
OR
a2n+1=\(\frac{a_1}{(2n+1)!}\) 
One can deduce the general expression for f(x) to be
f(x)=\(a_0 \times (\frac{1}{1} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + …\infty) + a_1 \times (\frac{x}{1!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}+…\infty)\) 
Now writing a0 = c1 and a1 = c2 we have
f(x) = c1 * cosh(x) + c2 * sinh(x).
3. The value of f(1) can be deduced using Taylor series.
a) True
b) False
a
4. To find the value of cosh(23) with good accuracy the Taylor series should be centered at _________
a) 23
b) 22
c) 21
d) Delta (small) interval around 23
d
5. Find the Taylor Series expansion of sinh (x) centered around 5?
a) \(\frac{x}{1!}+\frac{x^3}{3!}+\frac{x^5}{5!}+…..\infty\) 
b) \(\frac{(x-5)}{1!}+\frac{(x-5)^3}{3!}+\frac{(x-5)^5}{5!}+…\infty\) 
c) \(1+\frac{x^2}{2!}+\frac{x^4}{4!}+…\infty\) 
d) \(-(\frac{(x-5)}{1!}+\frac{(x-5)^3}{3!}+\frac{(x-5)^5}{5!}+…\infty)\) 
a
6. Let f(1) (n) = g(n) (0) for some functions f(x) and g(x). Now let the coordinate axes having graph f(x) be rotated by 45 degrees (clockwise). Then the corresponding Mclaurin series of transformed g(x) is?
a) g(x)=g(0)+(ex-1)+f(x)-f(0)
b) τ(f(x+tan(45)))=τ45(g(x))
c) g(x)=g(0)+g(1)(0).\(\frac{x}{1!}+g^{(2)}(0).\frac{x^2}{2!}+…\infty\) 
d) g(x)=\(g(0)-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{x^n \times f^{(1)}(n)}{n!}+(e^x-1)\) 
a
g(x)=g(0)+g(1)(0).\(\frac{x}{1!}+g^{(2)}(0).\frac{x^2}{2!}+…\infty\) 
We know that  f(1) (n) = g(n) (0)
After the graph f(x)  is rotated by 45  degrees we have an additional amount of tan45 gets added to slope of g(x)
f(1) (0) + tan(45) = g(n) (0)
After substituting this we have
 g(x) = g(0) + (f(1) (1) + tan(45)) \(\times \frac{x}{1!}\) +  (f(1) (2) + tan(45)) \(\times \frac{x^2}{2!}+…\infty\) 
g(x) = g(0) + \((f^{(1)}(1).\frac{x}{1!} + f^{(1)}(2).\frac{x^2}{2!} + f^{(1)}(3).\frac{x^3}{3!}+…\infty)+(\frac{x}{1!}+\frac{x^2}{2!}+…\infty)\) 
g(x)=\(g(0)-\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{x^n \times f^{(1)}(n)}{n!}+(e^x-1)\)  
g(x)=g(0)+(ex-1)+f(x)-f(0)
7. Let τa(f(x)) denote the Taylor series of the polynomial f(x) centered at a. Which of the following exactly happens after the Taylor series is formed?
a) τa(f(x)) = f(x)
b) The Taylor series has the effect of scaling GRAPH OF f(x)
c) The Taylor series transforms the origin
d) Scaled up graph obtained by factor of a
a
τa(f(x)) = f(x).
8. Let τ(x) be the taylor Series centered at 0. Let the Taylor series be approximated to fifth degree polynomial only, which is the interval over which f(x) = sin(x) can be accurately calculated.
a) (-∞, ∞)
b) [-2π, 2π] 
c) [-4π, 0] 
d) It is accurate for any interval
b
Hence, the interval where the roots of sine and polynomial approximately coincide is [-2π, 2π].
9. The Taylor polynomial of degree 6 is approximated for cos(x). Then the interval in which the function can be accurately calculated using Taylor series (center = 80π)?
a) [-3π, 3π] 
b) [77.5π, 83.5π] 
c) [-2.5π, 2.5π] 
d) [77π, 83π] 
b
The symmetry point is at the center of the Taylor polynomial (which is 80π).
The cos(x) function has roots at nπ/2
Hence, the interval over which the roots approximately coincide is [77.5π, 83.5π].
