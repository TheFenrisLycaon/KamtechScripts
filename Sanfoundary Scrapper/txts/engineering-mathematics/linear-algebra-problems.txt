1. Which of the following is not a condition for a given real nonsingular quadratic form, Q = XTAX, to be a negative definite quadratic form?
a) The number of positive square terms in the quadratic form is equal to zero
b) The rank of the matrix A is equal to the number of variables in the quadratic form (index)
c) All the eigen values of A are negative
d) The rank and index are equal
d
2. Signature of a quadratic form is the difference between the positive and negative terms in the canonical form.
a) True
b) False
b
3. Determine the nature of the given matrix.
\(\begin{bmatrix}2 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1\end{bmatrix} \)   
a) Indefinite
b) Positive definite
c) Negative definite
d) Positive semi-definite
b
\(\begin{vmatrix}2-λ & 0 & 0 \\1 & 2-λ & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1-λ \end{vmatrix} = 0 \)   
(2- λ) ((2- λ)(1- λ)) = 0
λ = 1, 2, 2
Since all the eigenvalues are positive, the condition for positive definite quadratic form is satisfied.
4. What is the signature of the quadratic form, \(Q = 7x_1^2+ 2x_2^2- 3x_3^2+x_{31}+ x_{23}=0\)?
a) 2
b) -2
c) 1
d) -1
c
5. What is the index of the quadratic form, \(3x_1^2+ x_3^2+8x_{13}+ 9x_{21}+ 2x_{23}=0\)?
a) 2
b) 4
c) 3
d) 1
a
Hence, from the given form, we have index = 2.
6. If A is a matrix, such that, Ak = 0, for positive integer k, then, A is known as Nilpotent matrix.
a) True
b) False
a
Whereas, if A2 = A, i.e. k=1, then it is known as idempotent matrix and if Ak = 0, then it is known as Nilpotent matrix.
7. Reduce the quadratic form to canonical form, \(3x_1^2+ 2x_2^2+8x_{12}+8x_{23}+8x_{31}=0\).
a) \(\begin{bmatrix}3 & 4 & 4 \\4 & 0 & 4 \\ 4 & 4 & 2\end{bmatrix} \)  
b) \(\begin{bmatrix}3 & 4 & 4 \\4 & 2 & 0 \\ 4 & 4 & 0\end{bmatrix} \)  
c) \(\begin{bmatrix}3 & 4 & 4 \\4 & 2 & 4 \\ 4 & 4 & 0\end{bmatrix} \)  
d) \(\begin{bmatrix}3 & 4 & 0 \\4 & 2 & 4 \\ 4 & 4 & 0\end{bmatrix} \)  
c
General form of the matrix can be written as, \(\begin{bmatrix}x_{11} & x_{12} & x_{13} \\ x_{21} & x_{22} & x_{23} \\ x_{31} & x_{32} & x_{33}\end{bmatrix} \)  
Hence, the matrix form can be obtained by,
Placing the square term coefficients in the diagonal of the matrix such that, \(x_{ii}= x_i^2,\) 
\(\begin{bmatrix}3 & x_{12} & x_{13} \\ x_{21} & 2 & x_{23} \\ x_{31} & x_{32} & 0\end{bmatrix} \)  
Dividing the coefficients of terms xij between xij and xji positions, for example, the coefficient of x12 is 8, hence the term x12 =x21= 8/2 = 4.
Therefore, the matrix form of the given quadratic equation is,
\(\begin{bmatrix}3 & 4 & 4 \\ 4 & 2 & 4 \\ 4 & 4 & 0\end{bmatrix} \)  
8. Write the expression for spur of a matrix for a 3×3 matrix whose entries are in the form of aij.
a) a11+ a12+a13
b) a11+ a21+a31
c) a12+ a22+a32
d) a11+ a22+a33
d
9. The Canonical form is also known as ‘sum of squares’ form.
a) False
b) True
b
10. Which among the following is not a type of quadratic form?
a) Positive Semi-definite
b) Negative definite
c) Partial definite
d) Indefinite
c
i. Positive definite
ii. Negative definite
iii. Positive Semi-definite
iv. Negative Semi-definite
v. Indefinite
