1. What is the order of the differential equation given by \(\frac{dy}{dx} + 4y = sin x\)?
a) 0.5
b) 1
c) 2
d) 0
b
It has order 1\(\rightarrow\) differential equation contains only \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) derivative with variables and constants.
2. Given the differential equation \(\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x^4-y^4}{(x^2+y^2)xy}\) the degree of differential equation is _____________
a) 1
b) 4
c) 0
d) 2
a
3. The process of formation of the differential equation is given in the wrong order, select the correct option from below given options.
1) Eliminate the arbitrary constants.
2) Differential equation which involves x,y,\(\frac{dy}{dx}.\) 
3) Differentiating the given equation w.r.t x as many times as the number of arbitrary constants.
a) 1,2,3
b) 3,2,1
c) 3,1,2
d) 2,1,3
c
4. What is the degree of first order differential equation, given by \(\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^{1.5} = \left(\frac{x cos⁡x}{x^2+\sqrt{sin⁡x}}\right)^3\)?
a) 1.5
b) 1
c) 3
d) 0.5

5. A racer accelerates from a stop so that its speed is 10t m/s t second after starting how far will the car go in 4 seconds?
a) 80m
b) 60m
c) 40m
d) 160m
a
\(= y(4)-y(0) = \big[5t^2\big]_0^4….. \) but y(0) = 0 since car is at rest at time t=o
y(4) = 5(16) = 80m.
