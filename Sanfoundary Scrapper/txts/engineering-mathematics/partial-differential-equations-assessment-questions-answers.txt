7. The solution of an ODE contains arbitrary constants, the solution to a PDE contains arbitrary functions.
a) True
b) False
a
An ordinary differential equation is a differential equation in which a dependent variable (say ‘y’) is a function of only one independent variable (say ‘x’).
A partial differential equation is one in which a dependent variable depends on one or more independent variables.

c) x+x2=0
d) x^”+2x=0

a) False
b) True
b
10. The symbol used for partial derivatives, ∂, was first used in mathematics by Marquis de Condorcet.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Which of the following is true with respect to formation of differential equation by elimination of arbitrary constants?
a) The given equation should be differentiated with respect to independent variable
b) Elimination of the arbitrary constant by replacing it using derivative
c) If ‘n’ arbitrary constant is present, the given equation should be differentiated ‘n’ number of times
d) To eliminate the arbitrary constants, the given equation must be integrated with respect to the dependent variable
d
To form a differential equation by elimination of arbitrary constant, the following steps need to be followed:
Differentiate (1) with respect to x
	In case of ‘n’ arbitrary constants, the equation should be differentiated ‘n’ number of times
	Eliminate the arbitrary constant using (1) and the derivatives
12. In the formation of differential equation by elimination of arbitrary constants, after differentiating the equation with respect to independent variable, the arbitrary constant gets eliminated.
a) False
b) True
