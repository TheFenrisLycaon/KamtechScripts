a) Order-5
b) Order-1
c) Order-4
d) Order-2
b
7. The half-interval method in numerical analysis is also known as __________
a) Newton-Raphson method
b) Regula Falsi method
c) Taylor’s method
d) Bisection method
d
8. Wave equation is a linear elliptical partial differential equation.
a) False
b) True
a
9. Which of the following is the condition for a second order partial differential equation to be hyperbolic?
a) b2-ac < 0
b) b2-ac=0
c) b2-ac>0
d) b2-ac= < 0
c
10. Which of the following statements is true?
a) Hyperbolic equations have three families of characteristic curves
b) Hyperbolic equations have one family of characteristic curves
c) Hyperbolic equations have no families of characteristic curves
d) Hyperbolic equations have two families of characteristic curves
d
\(aζ_x+(b+\sqrt{b^2-ac}) ζ_y=0 \, and \, aη_x+(b+\sqrt{b^2-ac}) η_y=0 \) 
The families of curves ξ = constant and η = constant are the characteristic curves. Hence, hyperbolic equations have two families of characteristic curves.
