9. Find the general solution of the linear partial differential equation, yzp+zxq=xy.
a) φ(x2-y2 – z2 )=0
b) φ(x2-y2, y2-z2 )=0
c) φ(x2-y2, y2-x2 )=0
d) φ(x2-z2, z2-x2 )=0
b
Here, the subsidiary equations are, \(\frac{dx}{yz}=\frac{dy}{zx}=\frac{dz}{xy} \) 
From the first two and last two terms, we get, respectively,
\(\frac{dx}{yz}=\frac{dy}{zx’}\)       or       xdx-ydy=0,          and
\(\frac{dx}{zx}=\frac{dy}{xy’}\)      or       ydx-zdy=0,
Integrating these we get two solutions
x2-y2=a ,                        y2-z2=b
Hence, the general solution of the given equation is,
φ(x2-y2, y2-z2 )=0.
