10. A partial differential equation is one in which a dependent variable (say ‘x’) depends on an independent variable (say ’y’).
a) False
b) True
a
A partial differential equation is one in which a dependent variable depends on one or more independent variables.
Example: \(F(x,t,y,\frac{∂y}{∂x},\frac{∂y}{∂t},……)= 0. \) 
11. What is the complete solution of the equation, \(q= e^\frac{-p}{α}\)?
a) \(z=ae^\frac{-a}{α}y\) 
b) \(z=x+e^\frac{-a}{α}y\) 
c) \(z=ax+e^\frac{-a}{α} y+c\) 
d) \(z=e^\frac{-a}{α}y\) 
c
The given equation does not contain x, y and z explicitly.
Setting p = a and q = b in the equation, we get \(b= e^\frac{-a}{α}.\) 
Hence, a complete solution of the given equation is,
\(z=ax+by+c,\,with \, b= e^\frac{-a}{α}\) 
\(z=ax+e^\frac{-a}{α} y+c.\) 
12. A particular solution for an equation is derived by eliminating arbitrary constants.
a) True
b) False
b
