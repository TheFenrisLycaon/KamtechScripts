1. Who was the first person to develop the heat equation?
a) Joseph Fourier
b) Galileo Galilei
c) Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit
d) Robert Boyle
a
2. Which of the following is not a field in which heat equation is used?
a) Probability theory
b) Histology
c) Financial Mathematics
d) Quantum Mechanics
b
Probability theory (to study Brownian motion)
	Financial Mathematics (for solving Black- Scholes PDE)
	Quantum Mechanics (to determine spread of wave function)
3. Under ideal assumptions, what is the two-dimensional heat equation?
a) ut  = c∇2 u = c(uxx  + uyy)
b) ut  = c2 uxx
c) ut  = c2 ∇2 u = c2 (uxx  + uyy)
d) ut  = ∇2 u = (uxx  + uyy)
c
We let u (x, y, t) = temperature of plate at position (x, y) and time t.
For a fixed t, the height of the surface z = u (x, y, t) gives the temperature of the plate at time t and position (x, y).
Under ideal assumptions (e.g. uniform density, uniform specific heat, perfect insulation, no internal heat sources etc.) one can show that u satisfies the two-dimensional heat equation,
ut  = c2 ∇2 u = c2 (uxx  + uyy)        for 0 < x < a, 0 < y < b.

b) True
