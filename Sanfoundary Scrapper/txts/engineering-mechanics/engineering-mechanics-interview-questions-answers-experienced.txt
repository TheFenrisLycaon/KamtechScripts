a) Towards positive z-axis
b) Towards positive y-axis
c) Towards positive x-axis
d) Towards negative z-axis
a
6. If a force applied at any point in its line of action and is still creating the same moment about any fixed point say P, then the force is said to be______________
a) Couple
b) Sliding vector
c) Slider couple
d) Couple slider
b
7. If a force applied at any point in its line of action and is still creating the same moment about any fixed point say P, then the force is said to be a sliding vector. What is the name of this property?
a) Associative property
b) Distributive property
c) Negative associative property
d) Principle transmissibility of the force
d
8. We can express the force in the Cartesian form.

b) False
a
9. M = ∑(rxF) represents what?
a) The total distance of the point of contact of the and the axis of rotation
b) The total moment of the forces

10. If a 12m high tree is being pulled by the tractor, by a rope tied over the top. With the tractor at a linear distance of 12m and 4m away perpendicularly from the tree. If the force applied by the tractor is 2KN then what is the moment caused by the roots of the tree?
a) -16.5i+7.51j KNm
b) -16.5i+5.51j KNm
c) -16.5i+5.51j KNmm
d) -16.5i+7.51j KNm
b
11. If F = F1+F2, then the moment of this force F about a point at a distance r is M=rxF1 + rxF2.
a) True
b) False
a
As M = rx(F) = rx(F1 + F2) = rxF1 + rxF2. This is known as the principle of moments. As the force is a vector quantity thus this is the distributive property which we apply to get the answer.
