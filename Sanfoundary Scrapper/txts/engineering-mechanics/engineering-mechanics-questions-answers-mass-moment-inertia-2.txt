3. We define the moment of inertia of a body as________
a)

5. We define the moment of inertia of a body in terms of volume of the body as______________
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
That is the integration of the total mass as determined by the product of the volume and density and the square of the distance of that mass from the axis of rotation. Thus the moment of inertia.
6. We use the distance of the axis and the particles, and in that we apply parallel axis theorem. The distance in the parallel axis theorem is multiplied by_______
a) Area
b) Volume
c) Linear distance
d) Area/Volume
a
7. One of the use of the centre of mass or centroid is as in the mass moment of inertia is that the net force acts at the ___________ of the loading body.
a) Centroid
b) The centre axis
c) The corner
d) The base
a
8. If the non-Uniform loading is of the type of parabola then for calculating the mass moment of inertia for areas?
a) The net load will not be formed as all the forces will be cancelled
b) The net force will act the centre of the parabola
c) The net force will act on the base of the loading horizontally
d) The net force will act at the centroid of the parabola
d
9. Determine the mass moment of the area of the cylinder given below.
a) Iz= 0.5mR2
b) Iy = 0.5mR2
c) Iz = 0.2mR2
d) Iy = 0.7mR2
a
10. Which of the following is true?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
That is the integration of the total mass as determined by the product of the volume and density and the square of the distance of that mass from the axis of rotation. Thus the moment of inertia.
11. The body is sometimes acted by two or three force members and we need to find the mass moment of inertia for the same. The difference between the two and the three force members is:
a) The former is collinear and the latter is parallel
b) The former is parallel and the latter is perpendicular
c) The former is perpendicular and the latter is collinear
d) The former is acting on two points in the body while the latter is on three points
d
12. If any external force also is applied on the structure and we are determining the mass moment of inertia then what should we consider?
a) The net force will act at the centroid of the structure only
b) The net load will not be formed as all the forces will be cancelled
c) The net force will act on the base of the loading horizontally
d) The net force will not to be considered, there would be a net force of the distribution, rest will be the external forces
d
13. If any external force also is applied on the distributed loading on which the mass moment of inertia is to be determined on the composite body then?
a) The net force will act at the centroid of the structure only
b) The net load will not be formed as all the forces will be cancelled
c) The net force will act on the base of the loading horizontally
d) The net force will not be considered, there would be a net force of the distribution, and rest will be the external forces
d
14. Which of the following is true?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
That is the integration of the total mass and the square of the distance of that mass from the axis of rotation. Thus the moment of inertia.
15. We use sometimes the measures to know the direction of mass moment of inertia. It is done by right handed coordinate system. Which is right about it for the composite bodies (consider the mentioned axis to be positive)?
