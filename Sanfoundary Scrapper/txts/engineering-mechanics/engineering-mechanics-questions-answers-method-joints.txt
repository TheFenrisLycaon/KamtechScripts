b
7. Which of the following conditions are true to make the calculations easy?
First condition: We use the method of a joint to find the forces acting over the joints in the space trusses.
Second condition: In this, we start from the joint having at least one known force and at the most two unknown forces.
a) We only see the first condition and neglect the second condition
b) We neglect the first condition and only see the second condition
c) We neglect both the conditions because calculations are possible without following the first and second conditions
d) First and second conditions are compulsory and can’t be neglected
d
8. We use the method of joint to find the net force acting over the entire structure.
a) True
b) False
b
9. The magnitude of the unknown force can’t be known. But the direction can be founded out.
a) The first part of the statement is false and other part is true
b) The first part of the statement is false and other part is false too

d) The first part of the statement is true and other part is true too
a
10. What is after taking the assumption of the direction of the force, the direction comes opposite?
a) The assumption made was wrong and the question can’t be solved further
b) The assumptions are not to be taken
c) The direction is in the opposite sense, and hence the direction is known to us
d) The direction will be already given to us, no need of assuming
