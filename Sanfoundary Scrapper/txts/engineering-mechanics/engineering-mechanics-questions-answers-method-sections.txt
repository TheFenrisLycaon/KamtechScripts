1. We use the method of joints when the members on which the force to be found are few in number.
a) True
b) False
a
2. The method of section cuts the whole structure of trusses into section and then uses the cut out portion for the calculations.
a) True
b) False
a
3. The method of joints helps us to find out the unknown force in the trusses joint. And the method of section helps us to make the calculation of the direction of the zero members.
a) The first part of the statement is false and other part is true
b) The first part of the statement is false and other part is false too
c) The first part of the statement is true and other part is false
d) The first part of the statement is true and other part is true too
c
4. Method of section cuts the whole structure of trusses into a section and then uses the cut out portion for the calculations of the unknown forces. For this method, at most two forces must be collinear.
a) The first part of the statement is false and other part is true
b) The first part of the statement is false and other part is false too
c) The first part of the statement is true and other part is false
d) The first part of the statement is true and other part is true too
c
5. The determination of the truss’s support reaction is done first and then the section is isolated for the method of the section.
a) The first step is right but the second one is wrong
b) The first step is wrong and the second one is wrong too
c) The first step is right and the second one is right too
d) The first step is wrong but the second one is right
c
6. Why the determination of the support reaction needs to be done before isolating the section?
a) This reduces the calculation and also the labour
b) This makes the isolated section more complicated
c) This results in reduction on the formulas used
d) This procedure is not done at all, it of no need
a
7. The free diagram of the section of the truss is made for the section having the least number of the forces. This is done as to make the calculations easy.
a) The first part of the statement is false and other part is true
b) The first part of the statement is false and other part is false too
c) The first part of the statement is true and other part is false
d) The first part of the statement is true and other part is true too
d
8. We have three method to solve for the unknown force in the trusses. They are method of section, method of joints and rotational vector method.
a) The first part of the statement is false and other part is true
b) The first part of the statement is false and other part is false too
c) The first part of the statement is true and other part is false
d) The first part of the statement is true and other part is true too
b
9. The free body diagram of which part of the section of the truss is made to make use of the method of sections?
a) Joints
b) Truss
c) The whole structure
d) Any section can be used
d
10. Determine the force in members UT.
a) 1980N
b) 800N
c) 2200N
d) 1100N
b
11. Determine the force in members UR.
a) 1980N
b) 800N
c) 2200N
d) 1100N
a
12. Determine the force in members QR.
a) 1980N
b) 800N
c) 2200N
d) 1100N
c
13. The system of the collinear and the parallel force are simplified as:
a) The simplified collinear force system gives us a net force and the parallel force system gives us a simplified force, and then we add it vectorially
b) Such simplification is not possible
c) The simplification is usually done by not considering the directions of the both
d) The simplification is done by considering the rotations only
