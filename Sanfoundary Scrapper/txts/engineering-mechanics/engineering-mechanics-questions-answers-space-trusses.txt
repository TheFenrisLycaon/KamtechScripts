a) Statement is correct
b) Statement is incorrect
c) Statement is incorrect because there are no rules

a
14. What is after taking the assumption of the direction of the force in space trusses, the direction comes opposite?
a) The assumption made was wrong and the question can’t be solved further
b) The assumptions are not to be taken
c) The direction is in the opposite sense, and hence the direction is known to us
d) The direction will be already given to us, no need of assuming
c
