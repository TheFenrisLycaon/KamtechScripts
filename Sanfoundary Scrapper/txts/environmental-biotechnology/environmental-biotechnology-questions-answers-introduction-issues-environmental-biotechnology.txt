8. Calculate the BOD value for the sample below including the minimum depletion and residual requirements.
Sample (ml)-100ml in 300ml bottle
Initial D.O (mg/ml): 9.2
5-days D.O (mg/ml): 5.3
a) 9.1
b) 9.75
c) 11
d) 9
b
Sample (ml) – 100ml in 300ml bottle
Initial D.O (mg/ml): 9.2
5-days D.O (mg/ml): 5.3
BOD (mg/ml) = D.O depletion/volume sample(ml)*300ml=initial D.O-final D.O/volume sample(ml)
=9.2-5.3/100*250=9.75.

a) Bio-methanation
b) Bio-luminescence
c) Bio-leaching
d) Bio-fortification
