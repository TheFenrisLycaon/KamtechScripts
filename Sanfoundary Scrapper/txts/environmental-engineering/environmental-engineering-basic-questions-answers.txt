a) 6.5-9
b) 7-8.5
c) 10-14
d) 0-7
a
9. Given list 1 and list 2, find which of the following pair is correctly matched?
List 1 (Chemical substance)
List 2 (Permissible limit in ppm)
A. Lead
1. 0.05
B. Phenol
2. 0.001
C. Zinc
3. 0.01
D. Chromium
4. 5
5. 0.2
a) A-5
b) B-3
c) C-4
d) D-2
c
10. What is the concentration of H+ ions in moles/L in water if the pOH value is 6?
a) 10-6
b) 10-7
c) 10-8
d) 10-9
c
pOH = 6, so pH = 14-6 = 8
H+ = 10-pH = 10-8moles/L.
