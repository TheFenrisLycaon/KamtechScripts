a) Sand
b) Anthracite
c) Crushed rock
d) Garnet sand
c
2. Which of the following is correct regarding the cheapest filter material used in water treatment?
a) Sand>Anthracite>Garnet sand
b) Sand<Anthracite>Garnet sand
c) Sand<Anthracite<Garnet sand
d) Sand=Anthracite>Garnet sand
a
3. Consider the following statements regarding sand as filter material.
i. It should be free from clay or silt
ii. Organic matter should be present in the sand
iii. It should be nonuniform
Which of the above statement is/are correct?
a) i, ii
b) i only
c) ii, iii
d) i, ii, iii
b
4. The uniformity characteristics of sand expressed in terms of __________
a) Effective size
b) Effective size and uniformity coefficient
c) Uniformity coefficient
d) Mean velocity
b
5. ____ represents the size of sand particle such that 10% of particles are finer than this size.
a) D0.1
b) D1
c) D10
d) D100
c
6. What is CU in the expression  CU= D60/D10  where D60 and D10 are the sizes of particle such that 60% and 10% of the particles are finer than these sizes respectively?
a) Coefficient of compaction
b) Coefficient of consolidation
c) Uniformity coefficient
d) Effective size
c
7. The effective size of sand of the slow sand filter is __________
a) 0.1-0.2mm
b) 0.2-0.3mm
c) 0.4-0.7mm
d) 1-2mm
b
8. What is the value of specific gravity of sand filter?
a) 2
b) 2.6
c) 3.1
d) 3.5
b
9. The value of uniformity coefficient for uniformly graded sand is ______
a) 0
b) 1
c) 10
d) 100
b
For uniformly graded sand,  CU = 1
                 So, D60 = D10.
10. The value of specific gravity for Garnet sand is ____
a) 2.1
b) 3.6
c) 4.2
d) 5.1
c
11. Which of the following statement is correct?
a) Ignition loss of filter should not exceed 3%
b) Wearing loss of filter sand should not exceed 5%
c) The range of CU for the slow sand filter is 3-5
d) The range of CU for the rapid sand filter is 3-5
c
