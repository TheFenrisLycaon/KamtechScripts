1. Which of the following is incorrect regarding circular sewer?
a) It is easily manufactured
b) It offers more opportunities for deposits
c) It is the most economical section
d) It has uniform curvature
b
2. A circular section of sewer gives _______  area for a given perimeter.
a) Small
b) Large
c) Minimum
d) Maximum
d
3. What is the wetted perimeter of a circular section of sewer?
a) (22/7) *D2
b) (22/7) *D
c) (22/7) *D2
d) (22/7)2 *D
b
4. The hydraulic mean depth of a circular section running full is __________
a)`D
b) D/2
c) D2
d) D/4
d
                                  = ((22/7) *D2/4) / (22/7) *D
                                  = D/4.

5. The proportional depth of a circular sewer running partially half is __________
a) (1-cosK/2)
b) (1/2) * (1-sinK/2)
c) (1/2) * (1-cosK/2)
d) (1-cosK/2)2
c
Proportional depth = Depth of flow d / Diameter of section D = (D/2) * (1-cosK/2) / D
                = (1/2) * (1-cosK/2).
6. The proportional perimeter of a circular sewer running partially half where K is the central angle subtended at a circular section of sewer  is __________
a) K/360o
b) K/90o
c) K/270o
d) K/180o
a
(22/7) *D*K/360o / ((22/7) *D) = K/360o.
7. The diameter of the circular sewer is 0.2m. The desired depth of flow is __________
a) 2/3 of the circular section of sewer
b) 1/3 of the circular section of sewer
c) 1/2 of the circular section of sewer
d) 1/4 of the circular section of sewer
c
8. The diameter of a circular sewer is 0.8m. The desired depth of flow is __________
a) 2/3 of the circular section of sewer
b) 1/3 of the circular section of sewer
c) 1/2 of the circular section of sewer
d) 1/4 of the circular section of sewer
a
9. A circular sewer having 0.4m diameter is flowing with velocity 2m/Sec. If the gradient of sewer is 1 in 90. Find the value of Chezy’s coefficient?
a) 10
b) 30
c) 60
d) 40
d
Slope of sewer S = 1/100, velocity V = 1m/Sec
According to Chezy’s formula, V = C (RS) 1/2 = C* (0.1/90) 1/2 = C/30
C = V*30 = 2*30 = 60.
