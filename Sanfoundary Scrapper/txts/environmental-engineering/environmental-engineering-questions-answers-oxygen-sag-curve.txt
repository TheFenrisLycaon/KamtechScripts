Figure: Oxygen sag curve
a) Rate of reaeration decreases
b) Rate of oxygen deficit increases
c) Rate of oxygen deficit decreases
d) Amount of oxygen in wastewater increases
b
7. Rate of aeration is independent of the D.O content of wastewater.

b
8. The reoxygenation constant at temperature ‘T’ is expressed by ___________
a) KRT = KR20 (1.016)T
b) KRT = KR20 (1.047) T-20
c) KRT = KR20 (1.016)T-20
d) KRT = KR20 (1.047)T
c
 KRT = KR20 (1.016)T-20, where  KR20  is the reoxygenation constant at 20oC.
