1. The runoff  in cumec by the Rational method is defined by ______________
a) Q = K*A*I*R
b) Q = (K+A+I) *R
c) Q = (K+A) *R
d) Q = A*I*R
a
2. The value of the factor K in finding the storm water flow by Rational method is ____________
a) 100
b) 160
c) 1
d) 1/360
d
Q = K*A*I*R where, K is a constant and K = 1/360,
So, Q = A*I*R/360.

a) Business area
b) An area closely built up
c) Area with 50% attached and detached houses
d) Extremely suburban area
d
7. If the type of surface is of the most densely populated  portion of the city, what is the value of Kuichling’s impermeability factor?
a) 0.14
b) 0.30
c) 0.80
d) 0.45
c
8. The value of Fruhlings factor for suburban locality is ______
a) 0.10
b) 0.20
c) 0.50
d) 0.80
c
9. The storm frequency for a peripheral residential area is ___ a year.
a) Once
b) Twice
c) Thrice
d) 4 times
b
10. The storm frequency for a peripheral commercial area is ____________
a) Once a year
b) Twice a year
c) Once in 2 years
d) Once in a month
c
11. Shorter the duration of rainfall ____ will be the rainfall intensity.
a) Lesser
b) Constant
c) Slightly lesser
d) Greater
d
12. When the storm occurs once a year, the rainfall intensity R is ____________
a) R = 300/t0.625
b) R = 150/t0.625
c) R = 150/t2
d) R = 300/t2
b
13. The Kuichlings formula when the storm occurs once in 10 years is ____________
a) R = 2667/(t + 50)
b) R = 260/(t + 20)
c) R = 2667/(t + 20)
d) R = 260/t
c
14. ________ is the time required by flood discharge to reach the maximum limit.
a) Storm frequency
b) Run-off time
c) Detention period
d) Time of concentration
d
15. The maximum runoff occurs when the duration of storm equals the time of concentration.
a) True
b) False
a
