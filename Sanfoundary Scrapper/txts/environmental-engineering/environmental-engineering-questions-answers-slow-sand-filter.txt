1. The depth of an enclosed tank of a slow sand filter lies in the range of  ______
a) 1-2m
b) 2.5-4m
c) 2-5m
d) 3-5m
b
2. When the fineness of sand increases __________
a) The bacterial efficiency increases
b) The rate of filtration increases
c) The rate of filtration first decrease, then increase
d) The bacterial efficiency remains constant
a
3. The thickness of the base material on which filter media are supported is __________
a) 10-100cm
b) 20-80cm
c) 30-75cm
d) 10-30cm
c
4. The minimum number of filter beds in the slow sand filter is __________
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 3
b
5. The area of the filter is 1500. What is the number of beds to be provided?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 6
b
6. The slow sand filter is able to remove ______ % of bacteria in water.
a) 90
b) 95
c) 98-99
d) 100
c
7. The slow sand filter is efficient in removing turbidity of water.
a) True
b) False
b
8. The maximum daily demand of a city is 24*105 and the rate of filtration is 100 per litre per hour per m2. What is the area of the filter?
a) 10
b) 100
c) 1000
d) 1500
c
Rate of filtration = 100
Area of filter=Maximum daily demand/Rate of filtration=24*105/(100*24)
                                        =1000m2.

d) Maximum weekly demand
a
10. What is the frequency of cleaning of a slow sand filter?
a) 1 week
b) 1-3 months
c) 2-3 days
d) 2-3 weeks
b
11. What is the maximum filter head up to which slow sand filters are worked upon?
a) 25cm
b) 50cm
c) 75cm
d) 100cm
c
