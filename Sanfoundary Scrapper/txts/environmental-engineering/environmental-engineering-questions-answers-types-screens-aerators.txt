a) 25mm
b) 50mm
c) 75mm
d) 100mm
a
3. The coarse screen is inclined at _____ to facilitate the cleaning or raking.
a) 300
b) 350
c) 450
d) 900
c
4. The head loss through screen depends on _______________
a) Shape of screen elements
b) Open area, block area
c) Approach velocity
d) Nature of their construction, approach velocity
d
5. The shape factor for circular rods in finding the head loss through the screen is _____
a) 1.79
b) 2.42
c) 1.83
d) 1.45
a
6. Micro strainers are used to remove color in water.
a) True
b) False
b
7. Identify the incorrect statement regarding aeration process.
a) It removes taste and odor
b) It increases the dissolved oxygen content of water
c) It increases the carbon dioxide content of water
d) It is used for mixing chemicals with water
c
8. The reduction of carbon dioxide by cascade aerators is in the range of __________
a) 10-20%
b) 20-30%
c) 40-50%
d) 50-60%
d
9. In which type of aerator, the flow of water is divided into fine streams and small droplets?
a) Cascade aerator
b) Inclined apron aerator
c) Spray aerator
d) Gravel bed aerator
a
10. The elapsed time in gravity filter is 1sec. What is the height of fall in a single descent?
a) 4.4m
b) 4.9m
c) 8.8m
d) 9.8m
b
Elapsed time, t = (2h/g) 1/2 in a single descent.
Height of fall, H = t2g/2 = 1*1*9.8/2 = 4.9m.
