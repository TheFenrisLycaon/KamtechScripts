1. How many types of sedimentation tanks are there on the basis of the method of operation?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
a
2. In which type of sedimentation, the flocculent suspension of the intermediate concentration takes place?
a) Type I sedimentation
b) Type II sedimentation
c) Type III sedimentation
d) Type IV sedimentation
c
3. In which type of sedimentation, the flocculent suspension of high concentration takes place?
a) Type I sedimentation
b) Type II sedimentation
c) Type III sedimentation
d) Type IV sedimentation
d
4. When the impurities are separated by the gravitation of settling particles, the operation is called ______
a) Sedimentation with coagulant
b) Plain sedimentation
c) Secondary sedimentation
d) Disinfection
b
5. What is the settling velocity of the particle in the wastewater if its diameter is 2 * 10-3cm. Given G=2.65, viscosity v=8 * 10-3cm2/Sec?
a) 0.01cm/Sec
b) 0.13cm/Sec
c) 0.24cm/Sec
d) 0.36cm/Sec
b
Specific gravity G=1, g=981cm2/Sec, viscosity v=8 * 10-3cm2/Sec
vs = 981 * (2.65-1) * 0.002 * 0.002/(18 * 0.008) = 0.13cm/Sec.

d
8. In a fill and draw type sedimentation tank, a detention period of ____ hours is provided.
a) 6
b) 12
c) 18
d) 24
d
