a) 5663
b) 56630
c) 566300
d) 5663000
b
7. Water lost in theft and waste contributes to how much % of total consumption?
a) 5
b) 10
c) 15
d) 20
c
8. Which is the correct statement regarding per capita demand?
a) Daily water required by an individual
b) Water required for various purposes by a person
c) Water required by an individual in a year
d) Annual average amount of daily water required by one person
d
9. What are the factors affecting per capita demand?
a) Size of city
b) Size of city, habit of people
c) Cost of water, quality of water, size of city
d) Cost of water, quality of water, size of city, habit of people
d
10. Which of the following statement is correct?
a) Rich class consumes less water
b) Intermittent water supplies leads to less water consumption
c) Loss of water is more if the pressure in the distribution system is less
d) Water consumption is less in flush system
b
11. If the annual average hourly demand of the city is 10000m3, what is the maximum hourly consumption?
a) 2700 m3
b) 27000 m3
c) 270000 m3
d) 2700000 m3
a
                                 = 2.7 * 10000
                                 = 27000m3.
12. If in a city, the maximum daily draft is 25MLD, fire draft is 35MLD and maximum hourly draft is 40MLD, what is the coincident draft?
a) 60MLD
b) 40MLD
c) 25MLD
d) 35MLD
a
Maximum hourly draft = 40MLD
Coincident draft is maximum of maximum draft draft + fire draft and maximum hourly draft =60MLD.
