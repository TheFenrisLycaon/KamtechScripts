1. Which of the following factor does not determine the choice of the reactor for a particular process?
a) Cost of a predetermined productivity within the product’s specifications
b) Form of enzyme (free or immobilized)
c) Active site is mainly constituted by non-polar amino acids for catalysis to take place
d) Kinetics of the reaction
c
* Cost of a predetermined productivity within the product’s specifications.
* Form of enzyme (free or immobilized).
* Kinetics of the reaction.
* The chemical and physical properties of an immobilization support.
Active site is mainly constituted by non-polar amino acids for catalysis to take place. This is one of the features of the active site.
2. _______________ are the reactors containing a settled bed of immobilised enzyme particles.
a) Continuous Stirred tank batch reactors
b) Packed bed reactor
c) Stirred tank batch reactors
d) Fluidized bed reactors
b
3. Which kind of reactor is represented in the following diagram?
a) Fluidized bed reactor
b) Packed bed reactor
c) Continuous flow membrane reactor
d) Batch membrane reactor
d
4. What does the diagram below represent?

5. The ratio of time that would be required to convert all the substrate if the enzyme acted at Vmax throughout to that of the actual time for complete conversion is referred to as ___________
a) fractional conversion
b) normalized time
c) specificity constant
d) miachelis Menten constant
b
Fractional conversion is given by X = 1 – S/S0.
Specificity constant is given by Kcat/Km.
Miachelis Menten constant Km is the substrate concentration at which Vmax is reduced to half.
6. The number which relates to inertial force due to flow of solution to the viscous force resisting that flow is referred to as _____________
a) specificity constant
b) turnover number
c) reynolds number
d) miachelis Menten constant
c
7. Le Goff number (Lf) is used in describing and comparing continuous enzyme reactors.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Fluidized bed reactors allow scaling up.
a) True
b) False
b
