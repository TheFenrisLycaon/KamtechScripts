1. Production of DE glucose syrup using glucoamylase has shortcomings as an object of commerce.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Glucose is converted to fructose by _________ enzyme.
a) lactase
b) phosphorylase
c) glucose isomerase
d) raffinase
c
3. What does ‘X’ represent in the following reaction?
Starch (Gn) + orthophosphate \( \underset{x}{\rightleftharpoons}\) Starch (Gn-1) + α – glucose – 1- phosphate
a) Lactase
b) Invertase
c) Phosphorylase
d) Raffinase
c
4. _____________ isomerizes α-D-glucopyranose to α-D –fructofuranose.
a) Xylose isomerase
b) Glucose isomerase
c) Sucrose phosphorylase
d) Invertase
a
5. Which of the following organism is capable of producing raffinase, but not invertase.
a) Yeast
b) Mortierella vinacea
c) Bacillus acidopullulyticus
d) Kluyveromyces lactis
b
6. ____________ is stirred with sugar beet juice in batch stirred tank reactors to remove raffinose.
a) Kluyveromyces lactis
b) Bacillus Licheniformis
c) Mortierella vinacea
d) Bacillus acidopullulyticus
c
7. Immobilized __________ is used to remove the raffinose and stachyose from soybean milk.
a) raffinase
b) xylose isomerase
c) invertase
d) papain
a
8. Which one of the following is not a step in production of glucose syrups using invertase?
a) Yeast cells were autolyzed
b) Filtration through a bed of calcium sulphate
c) Adsorption into bone char
d) Galactose released is destroyed by alkaline conditions
d
• Yeast cells were autolyzed.
• Autolyzate clarified by adjustment to pH 4.7.
• Filtration through a bed of calcium sulphate.
• Adsorption into bone char which helps in decolorizing the syrups.
Galactose released is destroyed by alkaline conditions of the first stages of juice purification and does not cause any further problems while the sucrose is recovered. This is stage in removal of raffinose and not production of glucose syrups.
9. A productivity of 16 tons of inverted syrup may be achieved using one liter of the granular enzyme.
a) True
b) False
a
10. Immobilized ______________ is used in the treatment of whey.
a) raffinase
b) lactase
c) invertase
d) rennet
b
11. Which of the following immobilized organism is not used to produce lactases?
a) Kluyveromyces lactis
b) Mortierella vinacea
c) Aspergillus Niger
d) Aspergillus Oryzae
b
12. Which of the following is not true for immobilized lactases?
a) Product inhibition by galactose
b) Unwanted oligosaccharide formation
c) Microbial contamination
d) Batch variability problems of acid hydrolysis
d
• Product inhibition by galactose and unwanted oligosaccharide
This may be reduced by increasing the effectiveness factor and a reduction in the degree of hydrolysis or initial lactose concentration which may also lead to a reduction in the economic return.
• Microbial contamination
This can be controlled by the use of regular sanitation with basic detergent and a dilute protease solution.
