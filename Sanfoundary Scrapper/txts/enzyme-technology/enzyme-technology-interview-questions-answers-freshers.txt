1. What happens to Vmax and Km in case of uncompetitive inhibition when I = Ki‘?
a) Lowers to 0.5 Vmax and 0.5 Km
b) Vmax is unchanged and Km increases 2Km
c) Lowers to 0.5 Vmax and Km remains unchanged
d) Lowers to 0.67 Vmax and Km increases to 2Km
a
When I = Ki‘ in this equation, the Vmax and Km is reduced to half.
2. If I = Ki = Ki‘, then what will happen to Vmax and Km when inhibitor acts non-competitively?
a) Lowers to 0.5 Vmax and 0.5 Km
b) Vmax is unchanged and Km increases 2Km
c) Lowers to 0.5 Vmax and Km remains unchanged
d) Lowers to 0.67 Vmax and Km increases to 2Km

4.  The following rate equation is given by ___________ inhibition.
\(V=\frac{\left (\frac{V_{max}}{1+\frac{[I]}{K_i’}}\right ) [S]}{\left (\frac{K_m}{1+\frac{[I]}{K_i’}}\right )+[S]}\) 
a) mixed
b) competitive
c) uncompetitive
d) non-competitive
c
\(V=\frac{\left (\frac{V_{max}}{1+\frac{[I]}{K_i’}}\right ) [S]}{\left (\frac{K_m}{1+\frac{[I]}{K_i’}}\right )+[S]}\) 
Where,
Km = Miachelis Menton constant, Ki‘= Dissociation constant for ESI complex, I = Inhibitor concentration and S = Substrate concentration.
