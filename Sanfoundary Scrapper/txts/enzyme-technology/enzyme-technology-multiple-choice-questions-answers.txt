1. Immobilization can greatly affect the stability of the enzyme.
a) True
b) False
a
Immobilization protocol may produce some strain on the enzyme which may lead to inactivation of the enzymes under denaturing condition conditions of pH and temperature.
As there is a substantial multipoint binding between the enzyme and the support, there is good amount of stabilization.
Immobilization also protects the enzyme from microbial attack, thus enhancing stability.
Enzyme and support must be complimentary with the formation of unstrained covalent and non-covalent interactions.
2. The ratio of volume of solution contained within the particle to the total volume of the particle is referred to as ____________
a) tortuosity
b) porosity
c) Km
d) catalytic efficiency
b
3. What does the equation, λ=\(\frac{[C_0^{n+}]}{[C^{n+}]}=\frac{[A^{n-}]}{[A_0^{n-}]}\) represent?
a) Turnover number
b) Catalytic efficiency
c) Electrostatic potential coefficient
d) Porosity
c
\(C_0^{n+}\) and \(A_0^{n-}\) ae concentration of anions and cations in bulk environment
Cn+ and An- are concentration of anions and cations in microenvironment
For positively charged enzyme surface, the value of λ should be greater than 1 and negatively charged the value should be less than 1. The effect of partition on positively and negatively charged particles is equal and opposite. Kcat is referred to as turn over number that denotes the number of catalytic turn over events that happens per unit time. Kcat/ Km is termed as catalytic efficiency. Porosity is referred to as the ratio of volume of solution contained within the particle to the total volume of the particle.
4. Which of the following equation is true for \(K_m^{app}\), when the substrates are negatively charged?
a) Kcat/Km
b) Km/λ
c) Kmλ
d) Vmax/2
b
5. Immobilized enzymes observe diffusional resistance at different levels.
a) True
b) False
a
The nature of support material
Hydro-dynamical conditions surrounding the support material
Distribution of enzyme inside/ on the surface of the support material.
Hence the above statement is true.

6. What does ‘a’ represent in the following graph?
a) Effectiveness factor
b) Catalytic efficiency
c) Kinetic control by the enzyme
d) Damkohler number
b
Kinetic control by enzyme which is extrapolated to show the activity of equivalent amount of free enzyme.
Mixed intermediate control.
Control by the rate of external transport of substrate.
The point ‘a’ in the graph represents kinetic control by enzymes. Damkohler number is the ratio of maximum rate of reaction to the maximum rate of diffusion. Effectiveness factor is given the ratio of rate of reaction catalyzed by immobilized enzymes to rate of the reaction catalyzed by free enzymes. Catalytic efficiency is given by Kcat/Km.
7. In case of immobilized enzymes, what type of inhibition is represented by the following equation?
\(V=\frac{V_{max} S}{K_m+\frac{K_m [S_0]K_L^s}{K_p K_l^p}}\) 
a) Substrate
b) Product
c) Uncompetitive
d) Competitive
b
Vmax = max rate of reaction, S = Substrate concentration, S0 = initial substrate concentration, Km = Miachelis Menten constant, \(K_L^s\) = Substrate mass transfer co-efficient, \(K_l^p\) = Product mass transfer co-efficient and Kp = Product inhibitory constant.
The effect of product inhibition depends on the bulk substrate concentration. The ratio \(\frac{K_m [S_0]K_L^s}{K_p K_l^p}\) expresses the competition between the substrate and the product at surface of the enzyme. This ratio increases with increase in the product, causing reduction in rate of the reaction and effectiveness factor.
8. The plot in the following diagram are referred to as _______________
a) concentration profile
b) pH profile
c) arrhenius plot
d) hanes plot
c
Point ‘a’ representing enzyme kinetic control.
Point ‘b’ representing control of the reaction rate by the internal diffusion of the substrate.
Point ‘c’ representing the control of the reaction rate by the diffusion of the substrate to the surface.
In the plot,
………………. low enzyme loading
____________  intermediate enzyme loading
__ __ __ __ __  high enzyme loading
An Arrhenius plot using real data for an immobilized enzyme would show pronounced curvature between the three phases. The transition between the linear sections would not be readily discernible, over the range of temperatures normally encountered for the use of immobilized enzymes, unless the standard free energy of activation for the reaction was unusually high.
9. What does the graph predict?
a) Effect of pH on activity of enzyme
b) Effect of substrate inhibition
c) Effect of temperature on activity on enzyme
d) Arrhenius plot
b
10. What does the diagram represent?
a) The effect of facilitated transport of hydrogen ions
b) Effect of substrate inhibition
c) The effect of diffusional control on pH activity profile of an immobilized enzyme
d) The effect of diffusional control on the local pH
