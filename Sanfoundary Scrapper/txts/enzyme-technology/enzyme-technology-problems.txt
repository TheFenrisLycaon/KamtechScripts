1. Use of glycosidases in synthetic reactions is a comparatively neglected topic.
a) True
b) False
a
• Polysaccharides can be obtained readily from plant or microbial sources.
• Polysaccharide function is not so specifically related to its structure.
• The theory describing the functional significance of oligosaccharides is still being developed.
• As there is an abundance of knowledge about glycosidases and their specificities, there is no fundamental reason why they should not be used to synthesize oligosaccharides.
Hence the above statement is true.
2. Which of the following enzyme is not used to construct oligosaccharides?
a) Dextransucrase
b) Levansucrase
c) Papain
d) Cyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase
c
3. Which of the following compounds are synthesized by fructosyltransferases?
a) Sucrose-6-acetate
b) Xylosucrose
c) L-aspartate
d) Neosugar
c
4. ____________ is a low cariogenic sweetener, which consists of a mixture of glucose, sucrose and β-2,1 linked fructans with terminal non-reducing glucose residues.
a) Neosugar
b) Xylosucrose
