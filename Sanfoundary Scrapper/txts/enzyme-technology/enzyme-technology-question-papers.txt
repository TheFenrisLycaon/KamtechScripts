1. One major factor that must be addressed for the use of biphasic systems in many enzyme-catalyzed reactions is ____________
a) solvent polarity
b) inactivation of the enzyme
c) stability of the enzyme
d) partition coefficient
c
2. In biphasic systems, the limited amount of water available considerably reduces the rate of thermoinactivation.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Due to organic phase in biphasic system, the most important factor in the balance between stabilization and inactivation is ______________
a) solvent polarity
b) inactivation of the enzyme
c) stability of the enzyme
d) partition coefficient
a
4. What does the following equation represent?
\(Log \,P=Log_{10} (\frac{[Material_{octanol}]}{[Material_{water}]})\) 
a) Solvent polarity
b) Km
c) pH
d) Ionic strength
a
\(Log \,P=Log_{10} (\frac{[Material_{octanol}]}{[Material_{water}]})\) 
The higher the Log P, the more hydrophobic is the solvent.

5. What is represented in the following diagram?
a) Effect of pH on activity of free enzyme
b) Dependence of the activity of immobilized enzymes in biphasic systems
c) Miachelis Menten plot
d) Bacterial growth curve
b
6. Which of the following factor is not important for making the choice of organic solvents in biphasic system?
a) Solvent polarity
b) Ease of recovery
c) Reproducible and linear
d) Specific inhibitory effects
c
* Solvent polarity
* Cost
* ease of recovery
* fire and fume hazards
* specific inhibitory effects
The response should be accurate, precise, reproducible and linear over the useful analytical range, without dilution or concentration. It should also be free from electrical noise. This is a feature that a biosensor should possess.
7. Biphasic systems may be stabilized by the use of __________
a) deuterated water
b) sugar
c) co-factors
d) co-enzymes
a
8. S-shaped curve may be shifted to the left by immobilizing the enzyme within highly hydrophilic support.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Which of the following is not an advantage of impregnated wet beads?
a) Protection of the contained enzyme
b) More facile recovery of the biocatalyst
c) Solvent polarity
d) Allowing efficient and continuous use of biphasic PBRs
c
* Protection of the contained enzyme at higher rates of stirring.
* Enabling more facile recovery of the biocatalyst.
* Allows to be used with low molecular weight hydrophilic coenzymes with the assistance of a coenzyme regenerating process.
* Allowing efficient and continuous use of biphasic PBRs as long as the moving organic phase is saturated with water.
Solvent polarity is one of the factors for the choice of the organic phase.
