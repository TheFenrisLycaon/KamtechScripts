b) Enzymes having other site
c) Regulatory metabolites are called effector or modulator or modifier
d) Each of two or more enzymes with identical function but different structure
d
• Greek word ‘allo’ means other and ‘steros’ means site.
• Enzymes having other sites.
• Regulatory metabolites are called effector or modulator or modifier.
2. The enzymes having allosteric sites, other than catalytic site which is used for binding for regulatory metabolites is referred to as _________
a) isoenzyme
b) biosensor
c) allosteric enzymes
d) effectors
c
3. Effectors that inhibit enzyme activity are termed as ____________
a) positive effectors
b) modulators
c) negative effectors
d) inhibitor
c
4. ________ is referred to as effectors which increase the enzyme activity.
a) Positive effectors
b) Modifier
c) Negative effectors
d) Inhibitor
a
5. What is represented in the following diagram?
a) Induced fit model
b) Mechanism of allosteric enzymes by modulators
c) Biosensor
d) Fluidized bed reactor
b
6. What is represented in the diagram?
a) Effect of temperature versus activity of enzyme
b) Effect of pH versus activity of immobilized enzyme
c) Effect of substrate concentration on reaction velocity for an allosteric enzyme
d) Effect of temperature versus activity of allosteric enzyme
c
7. Which of the following is not an inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase in conversion pyruvate to acetyl CoA?
a) Citrate
b) ATP
c) NADH
d) Acetyl CoA
a
8. Which of the enzyme ATP does not act as an inhibitor?
a) Isocitrate dehydrogenase
b) Phosphofructokinase-1
c) Glycogen phosphorylase
d) Fructose-1,6- bisphosphatase
d
• Isocitrate dehydrogenase in the TCA cycle.
• Phosphofructokinase-1 in glycolysis cycle.
• Glycogen phosphorylase in glycogenolysis.
9. Which of the following is not true of feedback allosteric inhibition in multienzyme system?
a) First enzyme of the sequence is regulatory allosteric enzyme
b) The enzyme is inhibited by the end product of the multienzyme system
c) Allosteric enzymes obey Miachelis-Menten kinetics
d) The whole enzyme system slows down to bring the rate of production of its end product back into balance when the cell needs it
c
• First enzyme of the sequence is regulatory allosteric enzyme.
• The enzyme is inhibited by the end product of the multienzyme system. Thus, the end product of the sequence acts as a specific inhibitor of the first regulatory enzyme in the sequence.
• The whole enzyme system slows down to bring the rate of production of its end product back into balance when the cell needs it. This type of regulation is called feedback allosteric inhibition.
10. What is represented in the following diagram?
a) Mechanism of allosteric enzymes by modulators
b) Allosteric feedback inhibition
c) Induced fit model
d) Biosensor
b
