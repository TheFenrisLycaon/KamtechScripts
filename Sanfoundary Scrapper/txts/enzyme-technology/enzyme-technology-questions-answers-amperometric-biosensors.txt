7. Use of mediators in amperometric biosensor is required.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Which of these properties is not true for mediators?
a) Mediators must react rapidly with a reduced form of enzyme
b) Mediators must be sufficiently soluble in oxidized and reduced forms
c) The reduced form of the mediator should not readily react with oxygen
d) Increasing the heat output
d
• Mediators must react rapidly with reduced form of enzyme.
• Mediators must be sufficiently soluble in oxidized and reduced forms.
• The reduced form of the mediator should not readily react with oxygen.
• The over potential for the regeneration of the oxidized mediator should be low and independent of pH.
Increasing the heat output is true for thermistors used in calorimetric biosensor.
9. Which of the following represents a commonly used family of mediators?
a) Pyruvate kinase
b) Hexokinase
c) Ferrocenes
d) Lactate oxidase
c
10. Amperometric biosensors for flavo-oxidase enzymes illustrates three generations in the development of a biosensor.
a) True
b) False
a
• 1st generation electrode: utilizes H2O2 produced by the reaction.
• 2nd generation electrode: utilizes a mediator to transfer the electrons, produced by the reaction, to the electrode.
• 3rd generation electrode: utilizes the electrons produced by the reaction.
Hence the above statement is true.
11. What is represented by the following equation?
I = nFAvA
a) Frequency
b) Current
c) Electrical resistance
d) Electrical potential
b
I = nFAvA where,
n = the number of electrons transferred, A = electrode area, vA = rate of reaction, and F = Faraday.
