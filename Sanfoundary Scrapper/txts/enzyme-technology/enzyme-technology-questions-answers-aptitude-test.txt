1. In the preparation of fruit juices and wines, enzymic hydrolysis becomes necessary.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Which of these is not an additional benefit produced by enzymic hydrolysis in preparation of fruit juices and wines?
a) Solution viscosity
b) Volume increase
c) Scoopability improvement
d) Shorter fermentation times
c
•	Solution viscosity
•	Volume increase
•	Beneficial changes in flavor
•	Shorter fermentation times in wineries
Scoopability improvement is required in ice-creams and skimmed milk powder, and is done by lactases.
3. Which of the following is not a part of enzyme preparation produced from Aspergillus Niger?
a) Polygalacturonase
b) Pectinesterase
c) Cellulase
d) Hemicellulase
c
•	Polygalacturonase hydrolyzes 1,4-a-D-galactosiduronic linkages randomly.
•	Pectinesterase releases methanol from the pectyl-methyl esters.
•	Pectin lyase which cleaves pectin without the necessity of pectin methyl esterase action.
•	Hemicellulase which is a mixture of hydrolytic enzymes.

6. Which of the following enzymes are not a part of hemicellulase?
a) xylan endo-1,3-b-xylosidase
b) xylan 1,4-b-xylosidase
c) Pectinesterase
d) L- rabinofuranosidase
c
7. Which of the enzyme acts on elimination reaction which releases oligosaccharides with non-reducing terminal 4-deoxymethyl-a-D-galact-4-enuronosyl residues?
a) Pectin lyase
b) Cellulase
c) Hemicellulase
d) Pectinesterase
a
8. Which of the following enzyme is not used in the brewing industry?
a) Fungal α-amylase
b) β-glucanase
c) Papain
d) Pectinesterase
d
•	Bacterial and fungal α-amylase are used in Saccharification of starch.
•	β-glucanase is used in the breakdown of barley β-1,4- and b-1,3- linked glucan.
•	Neutral proteases are used in hydrolysis of protein to increase the fermentation rate in the production of high gravity beer.
•	Cellulases help in breakdown the barley β-glucans.
•	Papain is used to prevent the occurrence of protein- and tannin-containing ‘chill-haze’ otherwise formed on cooling the beer.
Pectinesterase and not used in the brewery industry and releases methanol from the pectyl methyl esters.
9. Rum is prepared from __________
a) grapes
b) barley malt
c) molasses
d) corn

10. Light beers of low calorific value have become popular in recent times.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Whiskey cannot be prepared from ___________
a) barley malt
b) grapes
c) corn
d) rye
b
