6. What is represented in the following diagram?
a) Piezo-electric biosensor
b) Calorimetric biosensor
c) ELISA
d) Immunosensor
c
• Antibody is immobilised on the surface of a tube and a mixture of a known amount of antigen-enzyme conjugate plus unknown concentration of sample antigen is placed in the tube and allowed to equilibrate.
• After a suitable period, the antigen and antigen-enzyme conjugate will be distributed between the bound and free states dependent upon their relative concentrations.
• Unbound material is washed off and discarded. The amount of antigen-enzyme conjugate that is bound may be determined by the rate of the subsequent enzymic reaction.
7. What is represented in the following diagram?
a) Optical biosensor
b) Amperometric biosensor
c) ELISA
d) Immunosensor
d
• A transducer is coated with immobilized antibody. The transducer is immersed in a solution containing a mixture of a known amount of antigen-enzyme conjugate plus the unknown concentration of sample antigen.
• After a suitable period, the antigen and antigen-enzyme conjugate will be distributed between the bound and free states dependent upon their relative concentrations.
• Unbound material is washed off and discarded. The amount of antigen-enzyme conjugate bound is determined directly from the transduced signal.
