1. Calorimetric biosensors represent the most generally applicable type of biosensor.
a) True
b) False
a
2. In calorimetric biosensor, the temperature changes are measured by means of _________
a) Ion-selective electrodes
b) Clark oxygen electrode
c) Thermistors
d) Colorimetric test strips
c
3. Cholesterol: Cholesterol oxidase:: Esters: ______________
a) Glucose oxidase
b) Catalase
c) Chymotrypsin
d) Penicillinase
c
4. Trypsin: Peptides:: Amylase: ____________
a) Starch
b) Sucrose
c) Urea
d) Uric acid
a
5. Which of the following enzyme catalyzes uric acid?
a) Penicillinase
b) Uricase
c) Invertase
d) Urease
b
6. Which biosensor is represented in the following diagram?
a) Piezo-electric biosensor
b) Optical biosensor
c) Calorimetric biosensor
d) Amperometric biosensor
c
7. The relative decrease in the electrical resistance of the thermistor is proportional to the increase in temperature.
a) True
b) False
a
\(\frac{∆R}{R} = -(\frac{B}{T^2})∆T\) 
According to this equation, the relative decrease in the electrical resistance (ΔR/R) of the thermistor is proportional to the increase in temperature (ΔT). A typical proportionality constant (-B/T2) is -4% /˚C. The resistance change is converted to a proportional voltage change before amplification. The expected result is a linear correlation between the response and the enzyme activity.  Hence the above statement is true.
8. Which of these is not true for thermistors?
a) Low sensitivity
b) Low range
c) Increasing the heat output
d) generation or absorption hydrogen ions
d
* Low sensitivity (10-4 M) and low range (10-4 – 10-2 M) of thermistor can be used with greater sensitivity with reaction involving exothermicity.
* The low sensitivity of the system can be increased substantially by increasing the heat output by the reaction.
9. For measuring using calorimetric biosensors, the sensitivity of the glucose analysis using glucose oxidase may be doubled by the co-immobilization of _____________
a) penicillinase
b) uricase
c) catalase
d) urease
c
10. An extreme case of amplifying sensitivity for the determination of ADP does not involve co-immobilization which of the following enzyme?
a) Hexokinase
b) Lactate dehydrogenase
c) Pyruvate kinase
d) Catalase
d
