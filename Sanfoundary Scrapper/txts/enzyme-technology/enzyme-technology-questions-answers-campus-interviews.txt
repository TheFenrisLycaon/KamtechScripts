d) Angiotensin converting enzyme
d
2. Which of the following is not a clinical application of angiotensin converting enzyme?
a) Regulates blood pressure
b) Regulates blood volume
c) Gout
d) Prevents acidosis
c
• It regulates the sodium and potassium ions and helps adjusts blood pressure and blood volume.
