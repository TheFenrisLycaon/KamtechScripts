b) Inosine 5I – phosphate to inosine
c) Guanosine monophosphate to guanine
d) Creatine phosphate to creatine
d
• Adenosine monophosphate to adenosine.
• Inosine 5I – phosphate to inosine.
• Guanosine monophosphate to guanine.
These 3 pathways final product is uric acid.
2. Most of the dietary purines are converted to ________ in the intestinal cells.
a) chymotrypsin
b) creatine
c) uric acid
d) maltase
c
3. Excess of uric acid causes ________
a) duodenal ulcer
b) macroamylsemia
c) gout
d) sphincter of oddi
c
4. Which of the following statements are not true for gout disease?
a) Blocking secretion of pancreatic juice
b) Disease of joints
c) Joints become inflamed, painful and arthritic
d) Kidneys are also affected
a
• Disease of joints caused by elevated concentration of uric acid in blood.
• Joints become inflamed, painful and arthritic due to the abnormal deposition of uric acid crystals.
• Kidneys are also affected as excess uric acid is deposited in the kidney tubules.
5. Allopurinol is administered to treat gout.
a) True
b) False
a
6. Acetylcholinesterase is found in ________
a) saliva juice
b) pancreatic juice
c) matrix of synaptic cleft
d) tears
c
7. Which enzyme converts acetylcholine to choline and acetate?
a) Acetylcholine esterase
b) Creatine kinase
c) 5I – nucleotidase
d) Transaminase
a
8. Which of the following is not a step of action of nerve impulse?
a) Release of acetylcholine
b) Production of the muscle action potential
c) Termination of acetylcholine
d) Guanosine monophosphate to guanine
d
• Release of acetylcholine during exocytosis into the synaptic cleft.
• Activation of acetylcholine receptor by binding of 2 molecules of released acetylcholine which opens the channels of small cations such as Na+.
• Production of muscle action potential due to inflow positively charged sodium ions.
• Termination of acetylcholine by acetylcholine esterase which is attached to collagen fiber in extracellular matrix of synaptic cleft.

d) Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
b
• Severe diabetic ketoacidosis.
• Salivary gland disorders such as mumps, salivary calculi.
• Ruptured ectopic pregnancy.
