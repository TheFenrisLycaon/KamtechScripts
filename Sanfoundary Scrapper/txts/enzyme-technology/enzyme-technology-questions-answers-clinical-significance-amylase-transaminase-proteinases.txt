1. Enzymes that perform physiological function are termed as _______
a) allosteric enzymes
b) isoenzymes
c) non-functional enzymes
d) functional enzymes
d
2. Enzymes that do not perform physiological functions are called as _________
a) biosensor
b) isoenzymes
c) non-functional enzymes
d) functional enzymes
c
3. Which of the following enzyme hydrolyzes α-1,4 linkages in starch and glycogen to yield maltase?
a) Transaminase
b) Proteinases
c) α-amylase
d) Chymotrypsin
c
4. Amylase is found in ________ at higher concentration.
a) pancreatic juice
b) milk
c) tears
d) urine
a
5. Which of the following clinical condition does not show increase of amylase concentration?
a) Diabetic ketoacidosis
b) Cardiac arrest
c) Salivary gland disorders
d) Ruptured ectopic pregnancy
b
• Severe diabetic ketoacidosis.
• Salivary gland disorders such as mumps, salivary calculi.
• Ruptured ectopic pregnancy.
During cardiac arrest, the activities of transaminases are increased.
6. Which of the following is not a clinical condition associated with amylase?
a) Acute oliguric renal failure
b) Acute pancreatitis
c) Myocardial infarction
d) Duodenal ulcer
c
• Acute oliguric renal failure.
• Acute pancreatitis.
• Duodenal ulcer: The ampulla is involved in the inflammatory process thus blocking secretion of pancreatic juice into the duodenum.
7. Which of the following is not a clinical condition associated with amylase?
a) Liver disease
b) Sphincter of oddi
c) Macroamylsemia
d) Pneumonia
a
• Sphincter of oddi: results due to contraction of pancreatic duct sphincter.
• Macroamylsemia: results due to increase in plasma amylase with decrease in urinary excretion.
• Due to increased plasma amylase activity, cerebral trauma, shock and pneumonia may occur.
Transaminases are sensitive markers of hepatocellular injury. The value of transaminases reaches a peak when the illness is maximum.
8. Which of the following is a transaminase?
a) α-amylase
b) Chymotrypsin
c) Proteinases
d) Alanine transaminase
d
9. Which of the following do not have high concentration of aspartate transaminase?
a) Heart
b) Liver
c) Saliva juice
d) Kidney
c
10. Alanine transaminase is present in _________
a) pancreatic juice
b) liver
c) saliva juice
d) colostrum
b
11. Which of the following is not a clinical condition associated with transaminases?
a) Cardiac arrest
b) Macroamylsemia
c) Myocardial infarction
d) Liver disease
b
a) Cardiac arrest: During cardiac arrest, the activities of transaminases (ALT and AST) are increased.
c) Myocardial infarction: Plasma AST levels increases following myocardial infarction. The activity is more at 6-8hrs after onset, reaches its peak between 24-48hrs and attains normal level by 4-6-days.
d) Liver disease: AST and ALT are sensitive markers of hepatocellular injury in which ALT is a more specific indicator. The values are higher when illness is maximum. In case of inflammation, ALT activities are higher than AST.
12. ___________ exists as inactive precursor in neutrophils.
a) Alanine transaminase
b) Proteinases
c) α-amylase
d) Chymotrypsin
b
13. Genetic deficiency of __________ digests the pulmonary tissue.
a) α – amylase
b) α – 1 antitrypsin
c) Transaminase
d) α – 2 macroproteinase
b
14. Pick odd one out.
a) α – amylase
b) α – 1 macroproteinase
c) Transaminase
d) Proteinase
b
