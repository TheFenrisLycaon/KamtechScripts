d
2. Which of the following is not a step involved in discontinuous assay?
a) Taking sample from the reaction mixture at known time
b) Stopping the reaction by inactivating the enzyme
c) Measure the convenient change in absorbance
d) Measuring the amount of product formed
c
• Taking sample from the reaction mixture at known time after addition of enzyme.
• Stopping the reaction by addition of acid to inactivate the enzyme.
• Measuring the amount of product formed.

a) Continuous assay
b) Coupled assay
c) Enzymatic assay technique
d) Discontinuous assay
a
4. Which of the following assays, there is a convenient change is absorbance?

a
5. The reaction catalyzed by ornithine decarboxylase is an example of which assay?
a) Continuous assay
b) Coupled assay
c) Enzymatic assay technique
d) Discontinuous assay
b
6. Which of the following precautions must not be followed while performing assays?
a) The substrates, buffers etc., should be of high purity
b) Enzyme preparation should as pure as possible
c) The probe must be tiny and biocompatible
d) Stability of the enzyme during the time taken by assay
c
• The substrates, buffers etc., should be of high purity as the contaminants may affect the activity of the enzyme. For example: Certain NAD+ preparations contain inhibitor of dehydrogenases.
• Enzyme preparation should as pure as possible so that any other compounds or enzyme will not interfere with assay
• Stability of the enzyme during the time taken by assay to complete the reaction.
• pH, temperature etc., affects the activity of the enzyme, and hence has to be maintained by use of buffers, thermostable bath etc.
• It should be ensured that once steady state is reached, the rate of reaction is constant over a period of interest and proportional to the amount of enzyme added.
7. Which of the following is a precaution which must be followed while performing assays?
a) It should be ensured that once steady state is reached, the rate of reaction is constant over a period of interest and proportional to the amount of enzyme added
b) The response should be accurate, reproducible, precise, linear and free from electrical noise
c) The probe must be tiny and biocompatible
d) It should be cheap, small portable and capable of being used by semi-skilled operators
a
• The response should be accurate, reproducible, precise, linear and free from electrical noise.
• The probe must be tiny and biocompatible.
• It should be cheap, small portable and capable of being used by semi-skilled operators.
8. Use of thermostable baths, buffers are necessary while performing assays.
a) True
b) False
a
