9. Which of the following is not true for macroamylase?
a) Presence of macroamylase in the serum is referred to as macroamylsemia
b) Macroamylase is formed by binding of ordinary S type amylase with IgG, IgA or other normal –abnormal high molecular weight proteins
c) Macroamylsemia is not symptomless
d) Macroamylase causes a harmless condition which may be confused with other causes of hyperamylasemia
c
• Presence of macroamylase in the serum is referred to as macroamylsemia.
• Macroamylase is formed by binding of ordinary S type amylase with IgG, IgA or other normal –abnormal high molecular weight proteins.
• Macroamylase causes a harmless condition which may be confused with other causes of hyperamylasemia.
10. Which of the following is not a clinical significance of aldolase?
a) Progressive muscular dystrophy
b) Insecticide poisoning
c) Viral hepatitis
d) Prostate cancer
b
• Progressive muscular dystrophy is detected when high aldolase is seen in the serum.
• Viral hepatitis at early stage can diagnosed by slight increase in aldose levels.
• Prostate cancer at advanced stages may be diagnosed by slight increase in aldose levels.

b
• Detection of abnormal cholinesterase variants.
• Liver function test measures the synthetic capacity of liver. Decrease levels are observed in cases of acute chronic hepatitis and in advance cirrhosis and liver cancer.
• Measurement of exposure of organophosphorus compounds because of decreased activity of acetylcholinesterase.
