d) Enzymes having other site
d
• Many enzymes occur in several molecular forms called isoenzymes.

• Isoenzymes are coded by different gene.
2. Which of the following is not true for isoenzymes?
a) Regulation specific to distinct tissue and development stages
b) Distinctive properties and patterns of metabolism to particular organ
c) Regulatory metabolites are called effector or modulator or modifier
d) Fine tuning of metabolism
c
• It provides a means of regulation specific to distinct tissue and development stages.
• Its distribution in tissues gives out distinctive properties and patterns of metabolism to particular organ.
• Its existence provides fine tuning of metabolism in order to meet the need of given tissue or development stage.
“Regulatory metabolites are called effector or modulator or modifier.” This statement in true in case of allosteric enzymes, and not isoenzymes.

b) It catalyzes reversible phosphorylation of creatinine to creatinine phosphate by ATP
c) It has five isoenzymes
d) It is made up of two polypeptides
b
• It is a tetrameric enzyme.
• It has five isoenzymes: LDH1, LDH2, LDH3, LDH4, LDH5.
• It is made up of two polypeptides: M-type (muscle) and H-type (heart).
6. An increase in serum level of LDH1 relative to LDH2 is an indication of ___________
a) muscular dystrophy
b) leukemia
c) myocardial infarction
d) hepatitis with jaundice
c
7. Which of the following is not associated with increase of LDH activity in urine?
a) Megaloblastic anemia
b) Chronic glomerulonephritis
c) Diabetic nephrosclerosis
d) Kidney malignancies
a
8. LDH4 and LDH5: Bacterial meningitis:: LDH1 and LDH3: ___________
a) Kidney malignancies
b) Myocardial infarction
c) Intracranial hemorrhage
d) Viral meningitis
d
9. Which of the following is not an isoenzyme of acid phosphatase?
a) Prostate
b) Liver
c) Salivary
d) Spleen
c
10. Which of the following is not isoenzyme form of alkaline phosphatase?
a) Bone
b) Muscle
c) Placenta
d) Intestine
b
11. Which of the following is not true for creatine kinase?
a) Its activity is greatest in striated muscle, brain and heart tissue
b) It catalyzes L-lactate to pyruvate
c) It is a dimer
d) It has three isoenzymes
b
• Its activity is greatest in striated muscle, brain and heart tissue
• It is a dimer which is made up of 2 polypeptide chains: muscle (M) type or brain (B) type.
• It has three isoenzymes: CK1, CK2, CK3.
It does not catalyze L-lactate to pyruvate, but creatinine to creatinine phosphate by ATP which a reversible phosphorylation reaction.
12. CK1: brain:: CK3: _________________
a) Kidney
b) Spleen
c) Skeletal muscle
d) Cardiac tissue
d
13. Which is the only tissue which has mixed MB (CK2) isoenzyme?
a) Prostate
b) Liver
c) Cardiac tissue
d) Spleen
c
14. Which of the following is not a clinical application of creatine kinase isoenzyme?
a) Hypothyroidism
b) Damage of heart tissue
c) Myopathy
d) Leukemia
b
• Hypothyroidism shows an elevation CK activity, majorly CK3.
• Damage of heart tissue from myocardial infraction may detected my increased level of CK2 in blood.
• Myopathy and dystrophy has elevated levels of CK3 in serum.
15. Head injures can be detected by _______
a) increase of CK2 in blood
b) increase of CK1 in CSF
c) elevated levels of CK3 in serum
d) LDH2 and LDH3 increase
b
