a
3. Which of this is not true while selecting a solid matrix or column during affinity chromatography?
a) The matrix should interact weakly with enzymes
b) The matrix should be based on inorganic compounds
c) The matrix should exhibit good flow property
d) The matrix should be highly porous
b
• The matrix should interact weakly with enzymes in order to minimize non-specific adsorption of other enzymes.
• The matrix should exhibit good flow property.
• The matrix should be highly porous when there is relatively weak affinity between the ligand and protein.
• The matrix should be chemically and mechanically stable.
• The matrix must possess certain chemical groups.
