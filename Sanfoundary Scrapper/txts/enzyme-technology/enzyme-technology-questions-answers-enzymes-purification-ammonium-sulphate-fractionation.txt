a) True
b) False
a
2. Which of these is not a basic amino-acid?
a) Arginine
b) Histidine
c) Aspartate
d) Lysine
c
3. __________ is an acidic amino acid.
a) Lysine
b) Glutamate
c) Glutamine
d) Serine
b
4. Pick odd one out.
a) Histidine
b) Cysteine
c) Threonine
d) Tyrosine
a
5. When the enzyme solubility is reduced by reducing the water availability, the enzyme-enzyme interaction start to take place and they will aggregate to form precipitates. This phenomenon is called ______________
a) salting in
b) salting out
c) precipitation
d) chromatography
b
6. Ammonium sulphate is convenient and effective chemical for fractionation by salting out method.
a) True
b) False
c
7. Which one of the following cannot be used as alternative to ammonium sulphate?
a) Lysozyme
b) Methanol
c) Acetone
d) Propan-2-ol
a
8. What does the equation, log⁡S=Kintercept-Ksalt T represent?
a) Michalis Menton equation
b) Arrhenius equation
c) Lineweaver Burk equation
d) Solubility of an enzyme
d
S = Enzyme solubility
Kintercept = Intercept constant
Ksalt = Salting out constant
T = Ionic strength which is proportional to concentration of precipitating salt
The above equation may also provide with the minimum salt concentration necessary before the enzymes start precipitating.
