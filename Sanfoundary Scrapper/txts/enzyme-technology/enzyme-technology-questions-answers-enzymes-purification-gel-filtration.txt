1. _______________ is a liquid column chromatographic method of separating solute molecules according to differences in molecular size.
a) Thin layer chromatography (TLC)
b) Ion exchange chromatography
c) Gel filtration
d) Affinity chromatography
c
2. Which of the following technique separates the sample by percolating it through a bed of porous, uncharged particles?
a) Gel filtration
b) Filtration
c) Dialysis
d) Ultrafiltration
a
3. Which of the following is not a step involved in gel filtration?
a) Gel preparation
b) Precipitation
c) Sample application
d) Elution of the sample
b
(i) Gel preparation by using sponge like porous material which is equilibrated an applied in the column.
(ii) Sample application to the column which consists of different molecules.
(iii) To elute the sample, same solvent is applied to the column. Large molecules which cannot penetrate the gel, pass the column faster and get eluted first and smaller molecules they get penetrate the gel and take a longer time elute and thus, separating the sample of interest.
4. Which of the following is not a gel filtration media used in gel filtration?
a) Agarose gel
b) Polyacrylamide gels
c) Sephadex
d) Silica gel
d
5. Which gel filtration media is used to purify alpha amylase by gel filtration?
a) Biogel – P
b) Sephacryl S-300
c) Biogel – A
d) Sephadex
b
6. Alkaline protease is purified by gel filtration using __________ as gel filtration media.
a) Sephacryl S-300
b) Biogel – P
c) Sephadex G-100
d) Agarose gel
c
7. What does the schematic diagram below represent?
a) Gel filtration
b) Affinity chromatography
c) Dialysis
d) Filtration
a
8. Smaller molecules elute faster than larger molecules during gel filtration.
a) True
b) False
b
9. Pick the odd one out.
a) Gel filtration
b) Gel permeation chromatography
c) Ion-exchange chromatography
d) Restricted-diffusion chromatography
c
