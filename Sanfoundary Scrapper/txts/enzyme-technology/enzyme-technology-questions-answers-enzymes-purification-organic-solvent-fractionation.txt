1. Which of the following is not a step involved in purification?
a) Precipitation
b) Dialysis or ultrafiltration
c) Chromatographic techniques
d) Freezing technique
d
2. Insulin is purified under ___________ purifications.
a) analytical
b) chromatography
c) preparative
d) ultrafiltration
c
3. Purifications of purified proteins involved in small scale lab productions meant mainly for research purposes are referred to as _____________
a) preparative purifications
b) chromatographic techniques
c) analytical purifications
d) dialysis techniques
c
4. His-Tag allows the purification to be done in fewer steps.
a) True
b) False
a
5. Which of the following is a disadvantage of organic solvent fractionation?
a) Faster than column techniques
b) Denaturation of proteins
c) Low density than salt solutions
d) Short centrifugation times
b
6. A preferable technique to perform fractionation is to cool the enzyme solution.
a) True
b) False
a
7. What is the next step after organic solvent fractionation with dry ice – ethanol – water mixture?
a) Refrigerated centrifugation at 3000 g for 15 mins
b) Drying in freezer
c) Supernatant fractionation with ethanol
d) Precipitated protein dissolved in 0.01 to 0.05 M cold buffer
a
8. In the below diagram of organic solvent fractionation, what does Y represent?
a) Stirring motor
b) Thermometer
c) Protein solution
d) Dry-ice-ethanol water mixture
d
Hence Y represents dry-ice-ethanol-water mixture.
9. What does Z represent in the following diagram?
a) Parafilm
b) Glass rod
c) Protein solution
d) Ethanol-dry ice mixture
c
Z in the diagram represents the protein or enzyme solution which is to be purified. Parafilm is placed on the top of the beaker containing protein solution to avoid splashing of the cooling bath contents into the beaker. Glass rod along with motor is added to the beaker containing protein solution for proper mixing. Ethanol-dry ice mixture is used to maintain the temperature of the solvent.
10. Ethanol can be removed from protein precipitate by __________
a) lyophilization
b) ultrasonication
c) homogenization
d) dialysis
a
