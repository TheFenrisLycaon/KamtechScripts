1. The presence of enzyme in the sample can be detected by _________________
a) gel exclusion chromatography
b) affinity chromatography
c) ion exchange chromatography
d) thin layer chromatography (TLC)
d
2. The method which relies on differences in partitioning behavior between a flowing mobile phase and a stationary phase to separate the components in a mixture is referred to as _________________
a) homogenization
b) dialysis
c) chromatography
d) ultrafiltration
c
3. Which chromatography technique consist of a stationary phase immobilized on a glass plate and an organic solvent acting as a mobile phase?
a) Ion exchange chromatography
b) Affinity chromatography
c) Thin layer chromatography (TLC)
d) Gel exclusion chromatography
c
4. If the solvent phase in TLC was 80:20 mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate, the polar compounds will not move as much as non-polar compounds.
a) True
b) False
a
5. When the solvent phase in TLC is 20:80 mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate, the polar compounds will not move as much as non-polar compounds.

6. Pick odd one out.
a) Silica gel
b) Alumina
c) Cellophane
d) Cellulose
c
7. What is the coloring agent used to detect laccase?
a) ABTS
b) Acetylated cellulose
c) Kieselghur
d) Hexane and Ethyl acetate mixture
a
8. On spraying the coloring agent, the enzyme is detected as a __________
a) square
b) triangle
c) line
d) spot
d
9. The ratio of distance travelled by the sample over the total distance covered by the solvent is referred to as ___________
a) solubility
b) miachelis menton constant
c) retention factor
d) volumetric throughput
c
Miachelis Menton constant deals with enzyme kinetics is given by Km which is nothing but the substrate concentration when Vmax is reduced to half.
10. The below diagram shows the final result of a TLC. Given the distance travelled is 1.5 cm for component 3. Calculate the retention factor (Rf) of component 1.
a) 0.34
b) 0.79
c) 0.50
d) 0.39
a
=\(\frac{distance \,travelled \,by \,component \,3}{distance \,travelled \,by \,the \,solvent}\) 
Rf = 1.5/4.4 = 0.34.
