1. Enzymes are amphoteric molecules.
a) True
b) False
a
2. The pH at which the net charge on the enzyme molecule is zero is called __________
a) pKa
b) Half-life
c) Isoelectric point
d) Km
c
3. Calculate the ionic strength of 0.2 M solution of Calcium chloride?
a) 0.9 M
b) 0.06 M
c) 0.6 M
d) 6.0 M
c
Where ci = concentration of every ionic species, zi = Charge of every ionic species.
Charge of chlorine and calcium is -1 and +2 respectively.
Concentration of calcium = 0.2 * 1 = 0.2
Concentration of chlorine = 0.2 * 2 = 4
I = 0.5 (0.2[2]2 + 0.4 [-1]2)
I = 0.5(0.8 + 0.4)
I = 0.6 M.
4. The rate of enzyme catalyzed reaction decreases with an increase in ionic strength if the charges are identical.
a) True
b) False
b
Where, k = rate constant, k0 = rate constant at zero ionic strength, ZA and ZB = electrostatic charges on reacting species, I = ionic strength of the solution.
If the charges are opposite, there is a decrease in rate of reaction with increasing ionic strength. When the charges are opposite, there is an increase in rate of reaction with increasing ionic strength.
5. What does the following graph represent?
a) Effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme catalyzed reaction
b) Effect of pH on the rate of enzyme catalyzed reaction
c) Effect on ionic strength on the rate of enzyme catalyzed reaction
d) Effect of temperature on stability of an enzyme catalyzed reaction

6. The following graph represents the effect of ____________ on activity of an enzyme catalyzed reaction.
a) pH
b) Incubation period
c) Temperature
d) Productivity
c
7. What does the equation, k = \(Ae^{\frac{-∆G}{RT}}\) represent?
a) Arrhenius equation
b) Miachelis Menton equation
c) Lineweaver Burk equation
d) Half-life
a
Where k = kinetic rate constant, A = Arrhenius constant, ΔG = standard free energy of activation (kJ M-1), R = universal gas constant and T = absolute temperature.
Rate of all the enzyme catalyzed reaction with an increase in temperature is given by the Arrhenius equation. Miachelis Menton equation and Lineweaver Burk equation represents enzyme activity whereas Half-life represents the time at enzyme activity is reduced to half. 
8. For every, 1000 fold increase in pressure, the Km is _____________
a) reduced to half
b) doubled
c) reduced to zero
d) increased by 10 folds
a
9. The equation \(t_{1/2}=\frac{0.693}{k_d}\) represents ___________
a) Arrhenius equation
b) Lineweaver Burk equation
c) Half-life
d) Gibbs-Helmholtz equation
c
10. If the rate of denaturation of enzyme Y is 1.5*10-4/min, then the half-life of enzyme Y is ______ mins.
a) 0.462*103
b) 4.62*103
c) 46.2*103
d) 0.0462*103
b
Where t1/2 = half-life, kd = rate of denaturation
kd = 1.5*10-4
t1/2 = 0.693/(1.5*10-4) = 0.462*104 = 4.62*103 mins.
11. What is the rate of denaturation kd, if the half-life of an enzyme catalyzed reaction is 15.6 mins?
a) 4.4*10-2/sec
b) 0.4*102/min
c) 4.4*10-2/min
d) 0.4*102/sec
c
kd = \(\frac{0.693}{t_{1/2}}\) 
kd =\(\frac{0.693}{15.6}\) = .044 = 4.4*10-2/min.
12. The pH at which half the groups of a compound are ionized is referred to as _________
a) pKa
b) pI
c) I
d) Km
a
13. If Ka for acetic acid is 1.78*10-5, the pKa of acetic acid is _________
a) 0.475
b) 4.75
c) 2.5
d) 0.25
b
pKa = -log10[1.78*10-5] = – [-4.75] = 4.75.
