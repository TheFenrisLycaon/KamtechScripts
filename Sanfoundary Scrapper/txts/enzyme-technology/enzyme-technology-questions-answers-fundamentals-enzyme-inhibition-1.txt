c) products
d) inhibitors
d
2. In the following diagram, which kind of inhibition is represented?
a) Uncompetitive inhibition
b) Competitive inhibition
c) Non-competitive inhibition
d) Mixed inhibition
b
3. The following rate equation represents _____________ inhibition.
\(V=\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m (1+\frac{I}{K_i})+[S]}\) 
a) competitive
b) mixed
c) non-competitive
d) uncompetitive
a
Where,
Km = Miachelis Menton constant, Ki = inhibitor constant, I = Inhibitor concentration and S = Substrate concentration.
4. Uncompetitive inhibition is most noticeable at low substrate concentration and can be overcome at high substrate concentration.
a) True
b) False
b
5. Inhibition of invertase by sucrose falls into which category of inhibition?
a) Substrate inhibition
b) Non-competitive inhibition
c) Product inhibition
d) Competitive inhibition
a
6. ______________ inhibition represent the following rate equation.
\(V=\frac{\left (\frac{V_{max}}{1+\frac{[I]}{K_i}}\right )[S]}{K_m+[S]}\) 
a) Substrate inhibition
b) Competitive inhibition
c) Product inhibition
d) Non-competitive inhibition
d
\(V=\frac{\left (\frac{V_{max}}{1+\frac{[I]}{K_i}}\right )[S]}{K_m+[S]}\)  
Where,
Km = Miachelis Menton constant, Ki = inhibitor constant, I = Inhibitor concentration and S = Substrate concentration.
7. The __________ inhibition gives the following rate equation.
\(V=\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m+[S](1+\frac{[S]}{K_s})}\) 
a) Substrate
b) Mixed
c) Non-competitive
d) Competitive
a
Where,
Km = Miachelis Menton constant, Ks = Dissociation constant for substrate and S = Substrate concentration.
8. In competitive inhibition, what happens to Vmax and Km if [I] = Ki?
a) Lowers to 0.5 Vmax and 0.5 Km
b) Vmax is unchanged and Km increases 2Km
c) Lowers to 0.5 Vmax and Km remains unchanged
d) Lowers to 0.67 Vmax and Km increases to 2Km
b
9. Which of these is correct for mixed inhibition?
a) Lowers to 0.5 Vmax and 0.5 Km
b) Vmax is unchanged and Km increases 2Km
c) Lowers to 0.5 Vmax and Km remains unchanged
d) Lowers to 0.67 Vmax and Km increases to 2Km
d
Where
Km = Miachelis Menton constant, Ki = Dissociation constant for EI complex, [I] = Inhibitor concentration, S = Substrate concentration and Ki‘ = Dissociation constant for ESI complex
Now, if Ki = [I] = 0.5 Ki‘, then Vmax lowers to 0.67 and Km increases to 2Km.
