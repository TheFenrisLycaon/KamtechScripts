1. The development of genetically improved enzymes and of novel enzyme-like catalysts is undertaken by molecular biologists and organic chemists respectively.
a) True
b) False
a
• New enzymes are either sorted in the natural environment or by strain selection.
• Established industrial enzymes are being used in as wide a variety of ways as can be conceived.
• With the help of genetic engineering, novel enzymes are being designed.
• Also with the knowledge of enzymology, new organic catalysts are being designed and synthesized.
• More complex enzyme systems are being utilized.
Each of these areas has an extensive and rapidly expanding literature. Some advances possibly belong more properly to other areas of science. Thus, the above statement is true.
2. Many enzymes are not totally specific for their natural substrates.
a) True
b) False
a
