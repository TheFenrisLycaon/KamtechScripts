5. What does the following equation represent?
\(\frac{V_{max}}{Vol_s} t=[S]_0 X-K_m ln⁡(1-X)\) 
a) Miachelis Menten kinetics equation for enzymes
b) Miachelis Menten kinetics equation for immobilized enzymes
c) Miachelis Menten kinetics equation for stirred tank batch reactors
d) Miachelis Menten kinetics equation for non-competitive inhibition
c
\(\frac{V_{max}}{Vol_s} t=[S]_0 X-K_m ln⁡(1-X)\) where,
Vmax = Maximum rate of reaction, Vols = Volume of substrate solution, t = Time, Km = Miachelis Menten constant, S0 = Initial substrate concentration and X = Fractional conversation = 1 – S/S0.
6. Which of these is a disadvantage of membrane reactors?
a) Membranes need to be replaced at regular intervals
b) These may be used in either batch or continuous mode
c) These reactors allow easy removal of enzyme from the product
d) These reactors avoid the costs and problems associated with other methods of immobilization
a
* These may be used in either batch or continuous mode.
* These reactors allow easy removal of enzyme from the product.
* These reactors avoid the costs and problems associated with other methods of immobilization.
Membrane reactor system may be established. Hence, they may be used for production of enzymes on small scale, especially where multienzyme pathway is involved or regeneration of co-enzyme is needed.  The cost of the membranes and their replacement at regular intervals are the major disadvantages of membrane reactor.
7. ____________ is one which expresses the efficiency with which the energy dissipated in producing the fluid flow is used to transport material (and heat) to the catalytic surface.
a) Normalized time
b) Le Goff number
c) Reynolds number
d) Fractional conversion
b
8. Packed bed reactor is not referred to as plug flow reactor.
a) True
b) False
a
