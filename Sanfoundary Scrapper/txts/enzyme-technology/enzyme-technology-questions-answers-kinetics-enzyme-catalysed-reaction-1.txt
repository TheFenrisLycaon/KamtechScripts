a) Flexible nature of enzymes
b) [S] >> [E] 
c) [E]+[S]\(\rightleftharpoons\)[ES] 
d) It is the initial substrate concentration [So] that determines efficacy of an enzyme to mediate a reaction
a
* The substrate concentration will always be higher than enzyme concentration. [E] >> [S] 
* An equilibrium state is assumed between reactants and products. [E]+[S]\(\rightleftharpoons\)[ES] 
* It is the initial substrate concentration [So] that determines the efficacy of an enzyme to mediate a reaction.
2. Which of these is referred to as Kcat?
a) Miachelis Menten constant
b) Catalytic efficiency
c) Substrate concentration
d) Turn over number
d
3. What does the following equation represent?
\(\frac{1}{V_0} = \frac{K_m}{V_{max}} \frac{1}{[S]}+\frac{1}{V_{max}}\) 
a) Eadie-Hofstee plot equation
b) Lineweaver Burk equation
c) Miachelis Menten equation
d) Hanes plot equation
b
The graph proposed is not following a proper mathematical model.
The graph is following a tangent model and hence it is difficult to calculate an exact Km and Vmax.
Hence Lineweaver and Burk came up with a suitable solution to solve this problem. The equation
\(\frac{1}{V_0} = \frac{K_m}{V_{max}} \frac{1}{[S]}+\frac{1}{V_{max}}\) represents Lineweaver Burk equation where,
V0 = initial velocity, Vmax = maximum rate, Km = Miachelis Menten constant and [S] = substrate concentration.
4. Which of the following is based on rearrangement of Lineweaver Burk plot equation by multiplication of [So] factor?
a) Hanes plot equation
b) Eadie-Hofstee plot equation
c) Miachelis Menten equation
d) Eisenthal and Cornish and Bowden plot equation
a
V0 = initial velocity, Vmax = maximum rate, Km = Miachelis Menten constant and [S] = substrate concentration.
The graphical representation of [S0]/V0 versus [S0] is called the Hanes plot. One of the drawbacks of this approach is that neither the ordinate nor the abscissa represents independent variable, both are dependent on substrate concentration.
5. Miachelis Menten model is also referred to as “rapid equilibrium model”.
a) True
b) False
a
6. What does the following plot represent?
a) Miachelis Menten plot
b) Hanes plot
c) Lineweaver Burk plot
d) Eadie-Hofstee plot
a
V0 = initial velocity, Vmax = maximum rate, Km = Miachelis Menten constant and [S] = substrate concentration.
According to this equation, Vo versus [S] plot giving a hyperbolic curve is referred to as Miachelis Menten plot. The tangent to the curve at the origin goes through the point (V0 = Vmax), ([S] = Km). The substrate concentration, which gives a rate of half the maximum reaction velocity, is equal to the Km.
7. What does the following graph represent?
a) Miachelis Menten plot
b) Lineweaver Burk plot
c) Eadie-Hofstee plot
d) Hanes plot
d
V0 = initial velocity, Vmax = maximum rate, Km = Miachelis Menten constant and [S] = substrate concentration.
This plot yields a straight line of slope 1/Vmax, a y-intercept of Km/Vmax and an x-intercept of -Km.
8. ___________ is defined as the enzyme’s binding efficiency with its appropriate substrate through optimized multiple non-covalent interactions.
a) Km
b) Kcat
c) Catalytic efficiency
d) Vmax
a
9. 4*107: Catalase :: 25: ___________
a) Protease
b) Amylase
c) Glucose isomerase
d) Creatinine kinase
c
10. What is the ratio of V0/Vmax when [S] = 10Km?
a) 1/2
b) 10/11
c) 4/5
d) 5/6
b
Rearranging, \(\frac{V_0}{V_{max}} = \frac{[S]}{[S]+K_m}\) 
\(\frac{V_0}{V_{max}} = \frac{10K_m}{10K_m+K_m}\) 
\(\frac{V_0}{V_{max}} = \frac{10 K_m}{11 K_m}\) 
\(\frac{V_0}{V_{max}} = \frac{10}{11}\)
