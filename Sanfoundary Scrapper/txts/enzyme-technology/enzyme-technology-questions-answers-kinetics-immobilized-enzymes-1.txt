1. The kinetic behavior of a bound enzyme is similar to that of free enzyme.
a) True
b) False
b
Property of the enzymes may get modified by the immobilization protocols.
Different protocols may different effects on enzyme due to conformational alteration in enzyme or due to nature of support.
2. What does the following diagram represent?
a) Adsorption
b) Entrapment
c) Microenvironment and Macroenvironment
d) Covalent binding
c
The triangle represents the enzyme molecules. The internal solution with part of the surrounding solution is referred to as microenvironment. This is influenced by the surface characteristics of the immobilized enzyme. Partitioning of substances will occur between these two environments. Substrate molecules (S) must diffuse through the surrounding layer (external transport) as well as the pores (internal transport) in order to utilize all of the enzyme available.
3. What does the following diagram represent?
a) Effect of substrate inhibition on the rate of enzyme catalyzed reaction
b) Effect of multipoint interaction for stabilization of enzyme
c) Miachelis Menten plot
d) Effect of temperature on activity of enzyme
b
4. For positively charged substrates, \(K_m^{app}\) is given by which of the following?
a) Kmλ
b) Km/λ
c) Vmax/2
d) Vmax
a
\(K_m^{app}\) is apparent Km and given \(K_m^{app}\) = Kmλ for positively charged substrates. This can be calculated when the concentration of positively charged substrates in the bulk solution is known. For negatively charged substrates, the \(K_m^{app}\) = Km/λ. Km is the substrate concentration at which Vmax is reduced to half. Vmax is the maximum rate equation.
5. What does the following diagram represent?
a) Effect of temperature on activity of enzymes
b) pH activity profile of immobilized enzymes
c) Effect of hydrophobic support on pH activity profile of immobilized enzymes
d) Effect of multipoint interaction for stabilization of enzymes
c
6. Effectiveness factor is given by __________
a) ƞ=\(\frac{V}{V_free}\) 
b) \(D_a=\frac{V_{max}}{K_L [S_b]}\) 
c) \(K_m^{app}\) = Kmλ
d) λ=\(\frac{[C_0^{n+}]}{[C^{n+}]} = \frac{[A^{n-}]}{[A_0^{n-}]}\) 
a
7. Which concentration profile of substrate molecules approaching the curved surface of immobilized enzymes is shown in the graph below?
a) Enzymes attached to spherical particles
b) Enzymes attached to the outside of the cylindrical fiber
c) Enzyme attached to the inside of the cylindrical fiber
d) Free enzymes
c
8. What does the following graph represent?
a) Effect of co-immobilization
b) Arrhenius plots
c) Effect pf pH
d) Concentration profile
a
9. What does the following graph predict?
a) Arrhenius plot
b) Activity versus pH
c) Substrate concentration versus effectiveness factor
d) Miachelis Menten plot
c
10. What does the following graph predicts?
a) The effect of diffusional control on the local pH
b) The effect of diffusional control on pH activity profile of an immobilized enzyme
c) Effect of substrate inhibition
d) Arrhenius plot
b
