• Presence of lactose intolerance in new-born which may be noticed at birth. By feeding such kids lactose containing milk may result severe tissue dehydration, diarrhea and even death.
• Lactose low solubility which result in crystallization at 4˚C which prevents its use in concentrated whey syrups as they have unpleasant sandy texture and are prone to microbial spoilage.
• Disposal of whey containing lactose is expensive due to its high biological oxygen demand.
