1. ____________ involves the dissolution of nanogram-sized starch granules to form viscous suspension.
a) Proteolysis
b) Saccharification
c) Liquefaction
d) Gelatinization
d
2. What does the following equation represent?
\(DE=100*\frac{Number \,of \,glycosydic \,bond \,cleaved}{Initial \,number \,of \,glycosidic \,bonds \,present}\) 
a) Dextrose equivalent
b) Degree of hydrolysis
c) Km
d) Kcat
a
\(DE=100*\frac{Reducing \,sugar, expressed \,as \,glucose}{Total \,carbohydrate}\) 
Thus, DE represents the hydrolysis of the glycosidic linkages present in terms of percentage. Pure glucose has a DE of 100, pure maltose has a DE of about 50 and starch has a DE of effectively zero.
3. Which of the following enzyme is not used in starch hydrolysis?
a) α – amylase
b) Glucoamylases
c) Papain
d) Pullulanase
c
4. _________________ is not used in starch hydrolysis.
a) Rennet
b) Sachharifying α – amylase
c) β – amylase
d) Glucoamylase
a
5. Hydrolyzed starch is not used in which of the following processes?
a) Production of glucose syrups
b) Dehairing
c) Production of maltose syrups
d) Production of baby food
b
* Production of glucose syrups
* Production of maltose syrups
* Production of bulking agents in the food industry
* Production of baby food
* Baking industry
In dehairing, hydrolyzed starch is not used. The process of removal hair from hides is called dehairing. This is done by alkaline proteases which is a far more pleasant and safer than traditionally applied sodium sulfide.
6. Fungal amylase finds its use in the baking industry.
a) True
b) False
a
