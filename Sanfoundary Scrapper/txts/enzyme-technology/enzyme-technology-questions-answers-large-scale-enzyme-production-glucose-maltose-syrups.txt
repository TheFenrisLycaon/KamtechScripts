1. Which of the following is not a part of composition of glucose syrup?
a) 95-97% glucose
b) 1-2% maltose
c) 0.5-2% isomaltose
d) glucan 1,4-a-glucosidase
d
* 95-97% glucose
* 1-2% maltose
* 0.5-2% isomaltose
Glucan 1,4-a-glucosidase is an exoamylase which are used in the production of glucose syrups. Upon hydrolysis, this enzyme releases b-D-glucose from 1,4- α -, 1,6- α – and 1,3- α -linked glucans. This enzyme is obtained from Aspergillus Niger strains.
