1. Which of the following is a disadvantage of immobilized enzymes over free enzymes?
a) Repeated use of enzymes
b) Minimal downstream processing
c) Enzyme may become inactive
d) Thermal stability of the enzyme increases
c
• Repeated use of enzymes as it can be easily separated from the mixture.
• Enzyme immobilization prevents the enzyme from contaminating the product and in turn minimizing downstream processing cost.
• Thermal stability of the enzyme increases.
2. The surface of the matrix on which an enzyme is immobilized is called __________
a) enzyme immobilization
b) adsorption
c) biosensor
d) carrier matrix
d
3. Pick the odd one out.
a) Inertness of the carrier matrix
b) Matrix should be cheap
c) Repeated use of enzymes
d) Matrix should not allow microbial contamination
c
• Inertness of the matrix.
• Matrix should be cheap.
• Matrix should not allow microbial contamination.
• Matrix should render enzyme immobile.
• Matrix stability.
• Matrix physical strength.
• Matrix should be easily available.
Repeated use of enzymes is an advantage of immobilized enzymes. Enzyme immobilization means confining an enzyme to a confined space.
4. Which of the following is not an example of adsorbent?
a) Clay
b) Sepharose
c) Porous carbon
d) Ion-exchange matrices
b
5. The immobilization method in which the enzyme is linked to the carrier matrix by covalent bond between them is referred to as __________
a) adsorption
b) covalent binding
c) entrapment
d) membrane confinement
b
6. In which type of immobilization, the enzyme will be in a molecular cage?
a) Adsorption
b) Covalent binding
c) Entrapment
d) Membrane confinement
c
7. In which of the following method, entrapment can be achieved?
a) Adsorption
b) Membrane confinement
c) Covalent binding
d) Microencapsulation
d
8. In ________ method, the enzyme molecule in aqueous solution is confined within a semipermeable membrane.
a) adsorption
b) covalent binding
c) entrapment
d) membrane confinement
b
9. What does the following diagram represent?
a) Covalent binding
b) Adsorption
c) Entrapment
d) Membrane confinement
b
10. What does the following diagram represent?
a) Covalent binding
