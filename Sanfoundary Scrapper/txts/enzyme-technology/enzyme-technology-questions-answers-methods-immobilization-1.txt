1. The restriction of enzyme mobility in a fixed space is known as ___________
a) enzyme immobilization
b) enzyme inhibition
c) enzyme kinetics
d) biosensor
a
2. Which of the following is a disadvantage of an immobilized enzyme?
a) Immobilization process allows continuous process
b) Immobilization mean additional cost
c) Increase productivity
d) Immobilization prevents loss of activity
b
• Immobilization allows continuous process to be practicable, with a considerable saving in enzyme, labor and overhead cost.
• Productivity increased as it may be used fully at higher concentration and for a longer time.
• Immobilization prevents loss of activity as immobilized enzymes cannot be denatured.
3. Which of the following is not a property of carrier matrices?
a) Thermal stability
b) Stability of the material
c) Physical strength
d) Easily available
a
• Stability, physical strength and easily available.
Thermal stability of the enzyme increases is an advantage of immobilized enzymes over free enzymes.

a) Adsorption
b) Covalent binding
c) Entrapment
d) Membrane confinement
a
5. Which was the 1st enzyme to be immobilized by adsorption method?
a) Protease
b) Glucose isomerase
c) Invertase
d) Amylase
c
6. Which of the following matrix is not used while immobilizing the enzyme by covalent binding?
a) Agarose
b) Cellulose
c) Calcium alginate
d) Glutaraldehyde
c
7. Entrapment can be achieved by using which of the following ways?
a) Adsorption
b) Polymerized gel entrapment
c) Membrane confinement
d) Covalent binding
b
8. Which of the following is not a matrix used for entrapment?
a) Agar
b) Collagen
c) Glutaraldehyde
d) Diatomaceous earth
b
9. Entrapment of calcium alginate is not used in case of which of the following?
a) Enzyme immobilization of microbial preparations
b) Enzyme immobilization of plant preparations
c) Immobilization of invertase enzyme
d) Enzyme immobilization of animal preparations
c
10. Which of the following method can be applied when substrates molecules are much smaller than enzyme?
a) Covalent binding
b) Adsorption
c) Hollow fiber
d) Entrapment
c
11. What does the following diagram represents?
a) Covalent binding

d) Membrane confinement
a
The diagram of entrapment is represented by,
The diagram of membrane confinement is represented by,
12. The following diagram represents ____________ method of immobilization.
a) covalent binding
b) adsorption
c) entrapment
d) membrane confinement
c
