\(M_r=\frac{RTS}{D(1-Vρ)}\) 
a) Svedberg equation
b) Miachelis Menten equation
c) Arrhenius equation
d) Turn over number
a
Mr = Molecular weight, R = Universal gas constant, S = Svedberg constant, D = Diffusion constant, V = partial specific volume of the molecule, ƍ = density.
5. Which of this is not a part of a mass spectrometer?
a) Ion source
b) Biocatalyst
c) Mass analyzer
d) Detector
b
• Ion source: The sample is vaporized into a gas and then ionized by the ion source, usually by losing an electron to become a cation.
• Mass analyzer: The ions are then accelerated through a potential difference and focused into a beam to give all species the same kinetic energy.
• Deflection: The ion beam passes through a magnetic field which bends the charged stream.
• Detector: The number of ions at different deflections are counted by the detector.
6. Which of the following method to determine molecular weight uses SDS?
a) Mass spectrometry
b) Ultracentrifugation
c) Gel filtration
d) SDS-gel electrophoresis
d
7. In which of the following technique, the system is calibrated by using markers of known molecular weight to determine the unknown molecular weight?
a) Mass spectrometry
b) Ultracentrifugation
c) Gel filtration
d) SDS-gel electrophoresis
d
