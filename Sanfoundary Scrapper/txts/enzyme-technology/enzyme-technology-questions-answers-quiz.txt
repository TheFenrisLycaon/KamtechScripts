3. Which of the following equation is Eadie-Hofstee plot equation?
a) \(\frac{1}{V_0} = \frac{K_m}{V_{max}} \frac{1}{[S]}+\frac{1}{V_{max}}\)

c) \(V_0=K_m \frac{V_0}{S_0}+V_{max}\)

The extrapolation of graph to determine the -1/Km reaches the edge of the paper such that, the accurate value is unable to calculate.
The -1/Km value calculated for low substrate concentrations are seemed to be inaccurate for most times.
The linearity of the graph for calculating the -1/Km value is not clear.
To overcome these, Eadie-Hofstee plot equation was designed. The equation is
\(V_0=K_m \frac{V_0}{S_0} + V_{max}\) where,
V0 = initial velocity, Vmax = maximum rate, Km = Miachelis Menten constant and [S] = substrate concentration.
4. The equation which is based on reciprocal form of Miachelis Menten equation at constant [Et] level is referred to as ______________
a) Eadie-Hofstee plot equation
b) Eisenthal and Cornish and Bowden plot equation
c) Lineweaver Burk equation
d) Hanes plot equation
b
V0 = initial velocity, Vmax = maximum rate, Km = Miachelis Menten constant and [S] = substrate concentration.
At constant V0 and S0, a plot of Vmax against Km will be linear.
5. ______________ is defined as an enzyme molecule’s efficiency to convert maximum substrate molecules into product per unit time.
a) Catalytic efficiency
b) Miachelis Menten constant
c) Turn over number
d) Vmax
c
6. In the following plot, what does X represent?
a) Vmax
b) Km/Vmax
c) –1/Km
d) Smax
c
V0 = initial velocity, Vmax = maximum rate, Km = Miachelis Menten constant and [S] = substrate concentration.
According to this plot, the slope gives Km/Vmax, the y intercept gives 1/Vmax and the X on the x-intercept gives -1/Km.
7. What does the following plot represents?
a) Miachelis Menten plot
b) Lineweaver Burk plot
c) Eadie-Hofstee plot
d) Hanes plot
c
V0 = initial velocity, Vmax = maximum rate, Km = Miachelis Menten constant and [S] = substrate concentration.
The above plot yields a straight line of slope –Km, a x-intercept Vmax/Km and an y-intercept Vmax.
8. A low Km value points out a low affinity of an enzyme towards its substrate.
a) True
b) False
b
9. Given an enzyme with Km of 0.25mM, at what substrate concentration will the velocity of the enzyme reach 1/2 of the Vmax? (Vmax = 100 mmol/s)
a) 0.5 mM
b) 0.25 mM
c) 0.75 mM
d) 25 mM
b
\(V_0 = \frac{1}{2}*100\) 
V0 = 50 mmol/s
\(V_0 = \frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m+[S]}\) 
50 = \(\frac{100 [S]}{0.25+[S]}\) 
\(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{[S]}{0.25+[S]}\) 
0.25+[S]=2[S] 
[S]=0.25 mM.
10. An enzyme with a Km of 5mM has a reaction rate of 100 mmol/min at substrate concentration of 0.25 mmol. What is the maximum reaction rate that this enzyme can achieve when its saturated with substrate?
a) 2100
b) 1500
c) 1900
d) 9000
a
\(V_{max} = \frac{V_0 (K_m+[S])}{[S]}\) 
\(V_{max} = \frac{100 (5+0.25)}{0.25}\) 
\(V_{max} = \frac{525}{0.25}\) 
\(V_{max}\) = 2100 mmol/min.
