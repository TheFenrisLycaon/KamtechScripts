c) dextran-polyethylene glycol
d) sodium carbonate-polyethylene glycol
c
3. Aqueous-two phase systems are of considerable value to biotechnology.
a) True
b) False
a
* Aqueous-two phase systems provide rapid separation of biological materials with little probability of denaturation.
* Aqueous-two phase systems provide efficient mixing under very gentle stirring and rapid partition.
* Aqueous-two phase systems separate compounds in a few minutes, minimizing the harmful action of endogenous proteases.
4. Which of the following is not a use of aqueous-two phase system?
a) Enzyme kinetics
b) Separation of different types of cell membranes
c) Purification of enzymes
d) Extractive bioconversions
a
* Separation of different types of cell membranes.
* Separation of different types of organelles.
* Separation and purification of enzymes.
* Extractive bioconversions.
Enzyme kinetics study cannot be done by using aqueous-two phase system.
5. Which of the following methodologies is not used to extract an enzyme from the upper phase of aqueous 2 phase system?
a) Addition of salts
b) Desalting
c) Addition of a polymer
d) Generating a new biphasic system
b
* Addition of salts
* Addition of a polymer
* Generating a new biphasic system
Desalting cannot be used to extract an enzyme from the upper phase.
6. Which of the following is an extractive bioconversion?
a) Aspargine to aspartate
b) Plasminogen to plasmin
c) Starch to glucose
d) Penicillin to penicilloate
c
7. Which of this is a disadvantage of aqueous 2 phase system?
a) The enzymes which enter the upper phase are gradually lost
b) The enzymes are largely retained in homogeneous solution
c) The enzymes are stabilized by the presence of the polymers in homogeneous solution
d) No diffusion limitations to mass transfer exist
a
* The enzymes are largely retained in homogeneous solution.
* The enzymes are stabilized by the presence of the polymers in homogeneous solution.
* No diffusion limitations to mass transfer exist.
Disadvantages of aqueous 2 phase system are as follows:
* The need to separate the product from the upper phase polymers.
* The enzymes which enter the upper phase are gradually lost.
8. Which of the following is not related exponentially to partition co-efficient?
a) Surface area
b) Surface charge of the particles
c) Hydrophobicity of the phases
d) pH
d
\(P=\frac{C_t}{C_b}\) where Ct and Cb represent the concentrations in the top and bottom phases respectively. The partition coefficient is exponentially related to each of the following:
* Surface area.
* Surface charge of the particles.
* Difference in the electrical potential.
* hydrophobicity of the phases.
The influence of pH on protein partition is complex. A given protein distributes differently between the phases at different pH’s and ionic strength. But the presence of phosphate ions affects the partition coefficient in such way that the ions distribute themselves unequally resulting in electrostatic potential (and pH) differences. This means that systems may be ‘tuned’ to enrich an enzyme in one phase, ideally the upper phase with cell debris and unwanted enzymes in the lower phase.
