1. It would be useful if enzyme catalyzed reactions where performed in organic solvents, other than water.
a) True
b) False
a
• Water is not the ideal medium for the majority of organic reactions.
• Many reactants such as molecular oxygen, steroids and lipids are more soluble in organic solvents than in water.
• For accomplishing reactions with reactants quite labile in an aqueous environment, non-aqueous media may be used which allows a much increased volumetric activity to be achieved.
• Microbial contamination is a lesser of a problem in organic solvents. As a result of this, microbial proteases are absent which leads to an apparent stabilization in the biocatalyst.
2. Under normal physiological conditions, which of the following enzymes catalyze the degradation of polymers?
a) Transferases
b) Isomerases

a) Anhydrous enzyme suspended in the organic solvent
b) Enzyme dissolved in a reversed micellar medium
c) Immobilization by entrapment
d) Immobilization by adsorption
