6. Cleavage site for pepsin is _______________
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
7. What kind of process is represented in the following equation?
a) Hydrogenation
b) Substitution
c) Decomposition
d) Addition and elimination
a
8. Which of the following factor does not favor peptide synthesis?
a) Use of liquid/liquid biphasic systems
b) Selection of protecting residues for amino and carboxyl groups
c) Choice of pH
d) Location of proteases
d
• Choice of pH.
• Selection of protecting residues for amino and carboxyl groups which favor product precipitation.
• Use of liquid/liquid biphasic systems.
Location of proteases is important for its choice of raw material to obtain it. Hence it is not a factor which favors peptide synthesis.
9. An alternative strategy to produce aspartame is kinetically controlled synthesis.
a) True
b) False
a
10. What does the following reaction represent?
a) Hydrogenation
b) Kinetically controlled synthesis
c) Substitution
d) Decomposition
b
11. The conversion of porcine insulin to human insulin is catalyzed by ________ enzyme.
a) thermolysin
b) trypsin
c) streptokinase
d) asparginase
b
12. The conversion of porcine insulin to human insulin is achieved by ____________ reaction.
a) hydrogenation
b) transpeptidation
c) kinetically controlled synthesis
d) decomposition
b
13. The conversion of porcine insulin to human insulin is achieved by ____________ reaction.
a) hydrogenation
b) transpeptidation
c) kinetically controlled synthesis
d) decomposition
b
14. What is represented in the following diagram?
a) Production of aspartame
