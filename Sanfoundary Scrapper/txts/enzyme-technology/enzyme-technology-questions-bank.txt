b) False
b
2. __________ is the average ratio of path length between any points within the particle to their absolute distance apart.
a) Porosity
b) Kcat
c) Tortuosity
d) Catalytic efficiency
c
3. What does the following equation represent?
V=\(\frac{V_{max}}{1+\frac{K_m^{app}}{[S_0]}}\) 
a) Lineweaver Burk equation
b) Electrostatic potential coefficient
c) Miachelis Menten equation for enzymes
d) Miachelis Menten equation for immobilized enzymes
d
For immobilized enzymes, the substrate concentration is the concentration within the microenvironment(S0) and the equation is given by, V=\(\frac{V_{max}}{1+\frac{K_m^{app}}{[S_0]}}\)
Where, \(K_m^{app}\) = apparent Km, Vmax = maximum rate of reaction, V = rate of a reaction and Km = Miachelis Menten constant. Electrostatic potential coefficient is given by Ʌ =\(\frac{[C_0^{n+}]}{[C^{n+}]}=  \frac{[A^{n-}]}{[A_0^{n-}]}\) where,
\(C_0^{n+}\) and \(A_0^{n-}\) are concentration of anions and cations in bulk environment
Cn+ and An- are concentration of anions and cations in microenvironment
Lineweaver Burk equation is derived by reciprocating the Miachelis Menten equation.
4. What does the following diagram represent?
a) Activity profile of immobilized enzymes against pH
b) Lineweaver Burk plot
c) Effect of multipoint interaction for stabilization of enzymes
d) Effect of temperature on activity of enzymes
a
5. What does the equation, \(D_a = \frac{V_{max}}{K_L [S_b]}\) represent?
a) Porosity
b) Turnover number
c) Damkohler number
d) Tortuosity
c
Da=(maximum rate of reaction)/(maximum rate of diffusion)=\(\frac{V_{max}}{K_L [S_b]}\), where
Vmax = Maximum rate of reaction
KL = Mass transfer coefficient (cm/s)
Sb = Substrate concentration in bulk liquid (g/cm3)
Damkohler number has a significant effect on diffusional resistance. If the Da >> 1, the diffusion rate is limiting. Whereas if the Da ≪ 1, the reaction rate is limiting. For a = 1, the diffusion and the reaction resistances are comparable.
6. What does ‘X’ represent in the following graph?
a) Turnover number
b) Damkohler number
c) Vmax
d) Effectiveness factor
d
V = rate of reaction catalyzed by immobilized enzymes
Vfree = rate of reaction catalyzed by free enzymes
The red dotted line and blue non-dotted line represents the effect of particle diameter on the effectiveness factor at high surface concentration of the enzyme and at small surface concentration of the enzyme. According to the graph, as particle diameter decreases the effectiveness factor also decreases for high surface concentration and for small surface concentration, initially it is maintained and then decreases gradually. The ‘X’ in the plot represents effectiveness factor.
7. In case of immobilized enzymes, the equation \(V=K_L ([S_0]-[S])=\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m+S+\frac{S^2}{K_S}}\) represents ______________ inhibition.
a) substrate
b) product
c) uncompetitive
d) competitive
a
Vmax = max rate of reaction, S = Substrate concertation, S0 = initial substrate concentration, Km = Miachelis Menten constant, KL = Substrate mass transfer co-efficient, and Kp = Product inhibitory constant.
This equation is third order with respect to the micro-environmental substrate concentration.
8. What does the following graph represent?
a) Concentration profile
b) Variation in rate of reaction with surface concentration of the substrate
c) Arrhenius plot
d) Lineweaver Burk plot
b
9. The graph in the following diagram represents ____________________
a) The effect of diffusional control on the local pH
b) The effect of diffusional control on pH activity profile of an immobilized enzyme
c) The effect of pH on activity of a free enzyme
d) Arrhenius plot
a
10. Within the micro-environment, the same bulk concentration may give two different stable concentrations.
a) True
b) False
a
A low concentration which gives faster rate of reaction, with no substrate inhibition and equally fast rate of inward diffusion sue to steep concentration gradient.
A high concentration which gives slower rate of reaction due to substrate inhibition and equally slow rate of inward diffusion due to concentration gradient going downward.
There is a possibility of an existence of a third intermediate concentration depicting an unstable state which is not naturally established and is of no practical consequence.
