1. 1 kg of air is compressed from 40 m3 volume under 100 kPa pressure to 1 m3 volume.  What will be the pressure at constant temperature?
a) 5000 kPa
b) 6170 kPa
c) 3215 kPa
d) 4000 kPa
d
P1V1 = P2V2
P2 = \(\frac{P_1*V_1}{V_2} = \frac{100*40}{1} \) 
P2 = 4000 kPa.
2. A tractor tyre contains 28 litre of air at 184 kPa pressure and 27°C temperature. How much air does the tyre contain?
a) 0.0599 kg
b) 0.599 kg
c) 55.059 kg
d) 5.99 kg
a
PV=nRT
n=\(\frac{PV}{RT}=\frac{184*10^3*28*10^{-3}}{8.314*300}\)=2.06
Air in tyre = 2.06*\(\frac{29}{1000}\) = 0.0599 kg.
3. What will be the temperature, at which 28g nitrogen occupies a volume of 10 litres at 2.46 atmospheric pressure?
a) 319.48 K
b) 456.23 K
c) 299.64 K
d) 123.45 K
c
PV=\(\frac{W}{M}\)*R*T
T=\(\frac{P*V*M}{W*R}=\frac{2.46*10*28}{28*0.082}\) = 299.64 K.
4. 7 gram of gas occupies a volume of 4.1 litre at 300°K temperature and 1 atmospheric pressure. What will be the molecular mass of gas?
a) 78.19
b) 42.05
c) 35.65
d) 18.19
b
PV=\(\frac{W}{M}\)*R*T
M=\(\frac{WRT}{PV}=\frac{7*0.082*300}{1*4.1}\)=42.05.
5. A cylinder can withstand the L.P.G. at 16.7 atmospheric pressure, if at any time instant the inside pressure of L.P.G. becomes 13 atmosphere pressures at 27°C. Then what will be the temperature at which it will explode?
a) 116.7°C
b) 114.1°C
c) 112.1°C
d) 111.6°C
c
\(\frac{P1}{T1}=\frac{P2}{T2}\) 
\(\frac{16.7}{T1}=\frac{13}{300} \) 
T1 = 385.3K
T1 = 112.1°C.
6. The first I.C. engine was invented by _______
a) Nikolaus Otto
b) James Watt
c) Hudson
d) Norman
a
7. The function of piston pin is to _________
a) Absorb the cylinder heat
b) Join the connecting rod to the piston
c) Increase the speed
d) Joint wheel and connecting rod
b
8. Where are manifolds fitted?
a) The lower part of cylinder
b) The intake valves
c) The exhaust valves
d) The side of the cylinder
d
9. What is the clearance between rocker arm and valve stem is known as _______
a) Valve clearance
b) Sleeve
c) Tappet clearance
d) Buffer space
c
10. What is the detachable portion of engine, which covers the upper end of the cylinder known as ______
a) Cylinder head
b) Ignition cell
c) Combustion cell
d) Manifold
a
