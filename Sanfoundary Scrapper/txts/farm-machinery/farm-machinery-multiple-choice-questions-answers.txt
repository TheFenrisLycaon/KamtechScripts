1. What percentages of carbon are present in share of a mouldboard?
a) 0.70%-0.80%
b) 0.50%-0.60%
c) 0.30%-0.40%
d) 0.10%-0.20%
a
2. A bullock drawn desi plough is working at 2.4 KMPH and cutting soil 20 cm deep and 20 cm wide furrow at top. Calculate the volume of soil cut in 5h.
a) 248 m3
b) 219 m3
c) 240 m3
d) 200 m3
c
Distance covered in 5 h = 2.4 * 5 = 12 km = 12000 m
Therefore, volume of soil cut in 5 h = 12000 * 0.02 = 240 m3
3. A pair of bullocks exert 100 kg pull at 30° to the horizontal while making a V-shape furrow 15 cm wide and 5 cm deep. The speed of ploughing is 3 KMPH. What is the unit draft on the implement and horsepower developed by the bullocks?
a) 2.31 kg/cm2; 0.96 HP
b) 2.11 kg/cm2; 0.86 HP
c) 2.56 kg/cm2; 0.98 HP
d) 3.11 kg/cm2; 0.76 HP
a
Cross sectional area = \(\frac{1}{2}\)*b*h = \(\frac{1}{2}*15*5\) = 37.5cm2
Unit draft (Du) = \(\frac{P cosθ}{A} = \frac{100*cos30°}{37.5}\) = 2.31kg/cm2
Power = \(\frac{[Draft (kg)*S (\frac{m}{s})]}{75}\) hp = \(\frac{[P cos30°*3*1000]}{75*60*60}\)=0.96 HP.
4. A two-wheel drive tractor pulls an implement which requires a draft of 12.5 KN. The motion resistance of the tractor is 4.5 KN and the slip of the driver wheel is 20%. The transmission efficiency is 0.8. the percentage of power lost in converting engine power into drawbar power is ______
a) 26.47%
b) 36%
c) 41.18%
d) 52.94%
d
According to figure
0.64x = 17; x=26.56
D=12.5 KN, R+4.5 KN, s=20%
P=12.5 + 4.5=17 KN; But useful pull is only 12.5 KN
Percent Loss = \(\frac{26.56-12.5}{26.56}\) *100 = 52.94%.
5. What percentage of manganese are present in the share of a mouldboard?
a) 0.50%-0.80%
b) 0.90%-1%
c) 0.20%-0.40%
d) 0.10%-0.30%
a
6. Which share has a detachable piece?
a) Slip share
b) Slipnose share
c) Shin share
d) Bar point share
b
7. Which mouldboard has gentle curvature which lifts and inverts the unbroken furrow slice?
a) Slat type
b) General purpose type
c) Sod or breaker type
d) Stubble type
c
8. Gunnel is which face of the share that slides along the furrow wall?
a) Vertical
b) Horizontal
c) Centre
d) Parallel
a
9. Which share has the disadvantage of replacing the entire share if it gets worn out?
a) Bar point share
b) Shin share
c) Slipnose share
d) Slip share
d
10. Horizontal suction varies according to ______
a) Line of pull
b) Size of plough
c) Draft
d) Centre of power
b
