a
2. How is traction and the direction of travel related?
a) Traction is the slip in the direction of travel
b) Traction is the force in the direction of travel
c) Traction is equal to the direction of travel
d) Traction is inversely proportional to the direction of travel
b
3. What is co-efficient of traction?
a) C.O.T = (Total force output of the traction device in the direction of travel) + (Dynamic weight on traction device)
b) C.O.T = (Total force output of the traction device in the direction of travel) – (Dynamic weight on traction device)
c) C.O.T = (Total force output of the traction device in the direction of travel) * (Dynamic weight on traction device)
d) C.O.T = \(\frac{Total \, force \, output \, of \, the \, traction \, device \, in \, the \, direction \, of \, travel}{(Dynamic \, weight \, on \, traction \, device)} \)
