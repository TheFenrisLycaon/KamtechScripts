2. A chain is used for speed reduction from 240 rpm to 110 rpm. The number of teeth on driving sprocket is 22. The centre to centre distance between 2 sprockets is 540 mm and pitch circle diameter of driven sprockets is 480 mm. determine number of teeth on driven sprockets.
a) 48
b) 50
c) 52
d) 54
a
T2 = \(\frac{240*2}{110}\) = 48.
3. The pitch of a chain is 200 mm. An 8 sprocket is operating at 250 rpm and driving a 25 teeth sprocket through the drain. The tension in the chain is 15 KN. Determine the maximum power.
a) 100 kw
b) 200 kw
c) 300 kw
d) 400 kw
a
Power = 15000*\(\frac{8*0.2*250}{60}\) = 100 kw.
4. The centre to centre distance between two sprockets of chain drives is 600 mm. The chain drive is used to reduce the speed from 160 rpm to 90 rpm. The driving sprocket has 18 teeth and pitch circle diameter of 480 mm. Determine the pitch of the chain and teeth on driven sprocket.
a) 0.10 m, 46
b) 0.083 m, 36
c) 1 m, 26
d) 1.083 m, 16
b
\(\frac{N1}{N2} = \frac{T2}{T1} \) 
T2=\(\frac{180*18}{90}\) = 36 teeth.
5. Determine the length of the chain having 200 mm pitch and is used for speed reduction from 340 rpm to 120 rpm. The numbers of teeth on driving and driven sprockets are 20 and 40 respectively. The centre to centre distance between 2 sprockets is 540 mm and diameter of driven sprocket is 450 mm.
a) 5.145 m
b) 4.145 m
c) 3.145 m
d) 2.145 m
d
D1=\(\frac{120*0.48}{340} \) 
D1= 0.169 m
L=2*0.54*\(\frac{π}{2}\) (0.169+0.48)+\(\frac{[(0.48-0.169)^2]}{4*0.54} \) 
L = 2.145 m.

d) Power is to transmit radially
a
7. Which of the following rollers are used for external drive?
a) Roller chain
b) Hook link chain
c) Pintle chain
d) Plate chain
b
8. In chain drives the component with a cast throttled wheel is known as _______
a) Sprocket
b) Idler
c) Speed cone
d) Skirt
a
9. In chain drives, for higher speed and loads, suitable chains to be used are ______
a) Pintle chain
b) Sprocket chain
c) Roller chain
d) Hook-link chain
c
10. Pintle chains are made of ________
a) Roller links
b) Sprockets
c) Pintle
d) Malleable links
d
11. Pitch length of standard chain number 40 is ________
a) 1.3 cm
b) 2.3 cm
c) 3.3 cm
d) 4.3 cm
a
35-1 cm
40-1.3 cm
50-1.6 cm
60-1.8 cm
80-2.5 cm.
12. Chain and sprocket drive is preferred, when two parallel shafts are placed at a distance of _______
a) 5 m
b) 2 m
c) 10 m
d) 4 m
b
13. Perfect velocity ratio is obtained in ________
a) Gear drives
b) V-belts
c) Belts
d) Chain drive
d
14. A 20 teeth sprocket is operating at 150 rpm and driving a 43 teeth sprocket through a chain. The pitch of the chain is 250 mm and alternate strength is 10 KN. Determine the average torque applied to driven shaft at maximum power transmission.
a) 10000 N
b) 17105 N
c) 15984 N
d) 16156 N
b
D=\(\frac{0.25*43}{π}\) = 3.421 m
T=F*\(\frac{D}{2}\)=10*1000*\(\frac{3.421}{2}\) = 17105 N.
15. The chain drive is used to reduce the speed from 180 rpm to 90 rpm, the driving sprocket has 20 teeth and pitch circle diameter of 500 mm. The centre to centre distance between the sprockets of chain drive is 550 mm. Determine total number of links.
a) 65
b) 100
c) 45
d) 115
c
T2=\(\frac{180*20}{90}\) = 40 teeth
Pitch = \(\frac{πD}{T} = \frac{π*0.5}{20}\) = 0.078m
L = 2*0.55+\(\frac{0.078}{2}\)(20+40)+\(\frac{[(0.078)^2 (20-40)^2]}{4*π^2*0.55} \) 
L = 3.55 m
Number of links Ln = \(\frac{L}{P}=\frac{3.55}{0.078}\) = 45.
