1. Which part operates the tractor drawn semi-mounted or mounted type mowers?
a) PTO shaft
b) Cutter
c) Pitman
d) Grass board
a
2. Which clutch is used in the driving unit of a mower?
a) Fluid coupling
b) Dog clutch
c) Friction clutch
d) Single plate
b
3. What is the difference between each knife clips?
a) 5-15 cm
b) 40-50 cm
c) 35-45 cm
d) 20-30 cm
d
4. When the knife section stops in the centre of its guard on every stroke, it is known as?
a) Re-embankment
b) Reinforcement
c) Registration
d) Rescue
c
5. Calculate the total time required to harvest 2.5 hectares of grass by means of a 2 metre mower being operated at 4 km/hr. (Field efficiency=80%)
a) 2.5 hrs
b) 1.2 hrs
c) 3.9 hrs
d) 7 hrs
c
Actual area covered/hr = \(\frac{2*4*1000*80}{100}\)m2 = \(\frac{(2*4*1000*80)}{100*1000}\) ha
Time required for 2.5 ha = 2.5/0.64 = 3.9 hrs
6. What power is required to pull 1.2 mete mower working at a speed of 4.8 km/hr, if there is a load of 50 kg per metre length of mower and mechanical efficiency is 80%?
a) 1 KW
b) 0.98 KW
c) 0.23 KW
d) 2 KW
b
= 60*9.8 N
Power = \(\frac{N.\frac{m}{s}}{1000} \) 
Total power = \(\frac{60*9.8*4.8*1000}{60*60*1000}\) = 0.784 KW
Power required to pull the mower = 0.784/0.80 = 0.98 KW
7. How many hectares per day of 10 hours can be cut by a combine with 4 metre cutter bar, when it is running at 4 k/hr?
a) 16ha
b) 20 ha
c) 28 ha
d) 8 ha
a
Speed of combine = 4km/hr = 4*1000 m/hr
Area covered per hour = 4*4*1000 m2 = 1.6 ha
Area covered in 10 hrs = 1.6*10 = 16 ha
8. A mower has drive wheel of 60 cm diameter. The crank of the mower makes 600 rev/min when it is driven by a tractor, moving at a speed of 2.3 km/hr. If the speed ratio between the crank wheel and land wheel is changed to 27:1, calculate the increase in speed of mower to maintain same speed of crank.
a) 0.19 km/hr
b) 0.67 km/hr
c) 0.11 km/hr
d) 0.21 km/hr
d
Linear speed of mower = π * \(\frac{60}{100}*\frac{60}{27}\)*60 m = 2.51 km/hr
Increase in speed of mower = 2.51-2.30 = 0.21 km/hr
9. Which part of mower is used to regulate the height of cut above the ground?
a) Ledger plate
b) Wearing plate
c) Shoe
d) Grass board
c
