1. Which law states that the rate of heat radiated by a body is directly proportional to the excess of temperature, provided that the excess temperature is less as compared to the surrounding temperature?
a) Pascal’s law
b) Newton’s law of cooling
c) Einstein’s equation
d) Henry’s law
b
\(\frac{∂θ}{∂t}\) = KA(θ-θ0)
2. What output do the engines reject running at a speed of 2000 rpm and at full load condition using gasoline?
a) 0.75 KW
b) 0.89 KW
c) 0.23 KW
d) 0.44 KW
a
3. What would be the quantity of water to be circulated through the radiator, if diesel tractor developed 40 KW with a coolant temperature difference of 5.5°C?
a) 4.26 lps
b) 4.19 lps
c) 2.86 lps
d) 3.72 lps
d
In tractors, the required flow rate of water is 0.16 l/s per kw to drop the radiator temperature from 5.5 to 8.5°C
Q = 40*0.58*0.16 l/s = 3.72 lps
4. A body cools from 70°C to 40°C in 5 minutes at surrounding temperature of 10°C. How long will it take for the body to cool from 49°C to 25°C?
a) 4.3 minutes
b) 6.5 minutes
c) 3.3 minutes
d) 1.8 minutes
b
According to Newton’s Law of cooling
\(\frac{Q1-Qs}{Q2-Qs}\)αt
\(\frac{49-10}{25-10}=\frac{5}{t} \) 
T = 6.5 minutes
5. A diesel tractor develops 60 KW with a coolant temperature difference 5.5°C. What will be the quantity of water to be circulated through the radiator?
a) 3.72 l/s
b) 5.56 l/s
c) 9.88 l/s
d) 11.10 l/s
b
In tractors, the required flow rate of water is 0.16 l/s per kw to drop the radiator temperature from 5.5 to 8.5°C
Q = 60*0.58*0.16 l/s = 5.56 lps
6. What is the temperature of burning gases in the engine?
a) 3000-4000°C
b) 1500-2000°C
c) 11000-12000°C
d) 9000-10000°C
b
7. What is the melting point of Platinum?
a) 1750°C
b) 2050°C
c) 850°C
d) 750°C
a
8. What is the temperature of water in a closed radiator under high pressure?
a) 319°F
b) 123°F
c) 264°F
d) 243°F
d
9. At what temperature does the thermostats fully open?
a) 36°C
b) 98°C
c) 82°C
d) 42°C
c
10. Who invented the automobile water radiator?
a) Wilhelm Maybach
b) Karl Benz
c) Elon Musk
d) Alfred Noble
b
