c
3. Which of the following is not a method of water cooling?
a) Open jacket or hopper method
b) Open flame method
c) Thermosiphon method
d) Forced circulation method
b

a) \(\frac{dθ}{dt}\) = KA (θ-θ0)
b) \(\frac{dθ}{dt}\) = KA (θ+θ0)
c) \(\frac{dθ}{dt}\) = KA (θ*θ0)

5. What amount of washing soda and kerosene oil should be added in water to make a solution to clean the cooling system?
a) 2 kg water and 0.5 kg kerosene oil
b) 2.5 kg water and 1.5 kg kerosene oil
c) 1 kg water and 0.5 kg kerosene oil
d) 1.5 kg water and 2.5 kg kerosene oil
c
6. What is the maximum permissible V-belt sag?
a) 15 mm

7. A capillary tube has a diameter of 3 mm and 100 mm length. A head of 10 cm of oil above the inlet of the capillary maintains a pressure difference across the capillary. The specific gravity of oil is 0.92. A volume of 300 cm3 of oil passes through the in 10s. What will be the viscosity of oil?
a) 5.68 * 10-4 poise
b) 5.98 * 10-4 poise
c) 5.68 * 10-5 poise
d) 5.98 * 10-5 poise
b
P = 0.92 * 981 * 1
P = 902.52 dyne/cm2
Now,
η = \(\frac{π p r^4 t}{8Vl} = \frac{[π*902.52*(0.15)^4*10]}{8*300*10}\) = 5.98 * 10-4poise.

a) 8.5°C to 5.5 °C
b) 11°C to 10 °C
c) 20°C to 15 °C
d) 12.75 °C to 9.79°C
