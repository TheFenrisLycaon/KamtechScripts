1. Which of the following is not a type of a cultivator?
a) Disc
b) Rotary
c) Tine
d) Off-set
d
2. A five-tine cultivator having tine spacing 8cm, working depth of 5cm and speed is 3km/hr. Turning loss is 10%. Soil resistance is 0.6 kg/cm2. Width of furrow is 5 cm. What will be the maximum draft?
a) 106 kg
b) 120 kg
c) 186 kg
d) 116 kg
b
Speed of travel = 3 km/hr = 3000 m/hr
Area covered/hr = \(\frac{0.40*3000}{10000}*\frac{90}{100}\) = 0.108 ha
Time required = 1/0.108 = 9.25 hr
Cross section of 5 furrows = 5*8*5 = 200 cm2
Maximum draft= 200 * 0.6 = 120 kg.
3. A tractor is attached with a 9-tine cultivator. While field testing, drawbar dynamometer shows an average pull of 14000 N. the speed of tractor is 6 km per hour. Find the power of the tractor.
a) 24 KW
b) 25 KW
c) 21.67 KW
d) 23.33 KW
d
Pull = 14000 N
Power = Pull * Speed
= 14000 * 10/6 N.m/s
= 23333.33 N.m/s
= 23333.33 Watts
= 23.33 KW.
4. What is the cutting angle range of a shovel?
a) 15°-20°
b) 34°-39°
c) 45°-49°
d) 50°-60°
a
5. What is the angle made by the three openings at the bottom of the funnel?
a) 110°
b) 100°
c) 106°
d) 120°
d
6. What are the dimensions of a duck foot cultivator?
a) 225 cm long; 60 cm wide; 7 sweeps
b) 106 cm long; 90 cm wide; 7 sweeps
c) 120 cm long; 60 cm wide; 6 sweeps
d) 215 cm long; 50 cm wide; 10 sweeps
a
7. Which cultivators are operated by the tractors which are fitted with hydraulic lift?
a) Trailed cultivator
b) Mounted cultivator
c) Cultivator with spring loaded tines
d) Cultivator with rigid tines
b
8. In which cultivator, the spacing of the tines are changed by slackening and sliding of bolts?
a) Cultivator with rigid tines
b) Cultivator with spring loaded tines
c) Duck foot cultivator
d) Mounted cultivator
a
9. A three-tine cultivator having tine spacing 6 cm, working depth of 3 cm and speed is 2 km/hr. Turning loss is 10%. Soil resistance is 0.6 kg/cm2. Width of furrow is 6 cm. What will be the required power?
a) 0.54 KW
b) 0.23 KW
c) 0.17 KW
d) 1 KW
b
Speed of travel = 2 km/hr = 2000 m/hr
Area covered/hr = \(\frac{0.18*2000}{10000}*\frac{90}{100}\) = 0.0324 ha
Time required = 1/0.0324 = 30.86 hr
Cross section of 3 furrows = 3*8*3 = 72 cm2
Maximum draft = 72 * 0.6 = 43.2 kg
Required power = \(\frac{Draft*Speed}{1000} = \frac{43.2*9.8*2*1000}{60*60*1000}\) = 0.23 KW.
