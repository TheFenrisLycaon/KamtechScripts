1. Which engine is designed to convert chemical energy of heavier fuel oil into mechanical energy?
a) Diesel engine
b) Petrol engine
c) Injector
d) Tappet clearance
a
2. The process of removal of burnt or exhaust gases from the engine cylinder is known as ___________
a) Tappet
b) Skirt
c) Scavenging
d) Suction
c
3. The device in which air-fuel mixture is prepared away from the cylinder of an engine is known as __________
a) Lubricant
b) Delivery valve
c) Nozzle holder
d) Carburettor
d
4. The correct way of representing the compression ratio is __________
a) C.R.=\(\frac{Total \, cylinder \, volume}{Clearance \, Volume} \) 
b) C.R.=\(\frac{Clearance \, Volume}{Total \, Clearance \, Volume} \) 
c) C.R.=\(\frac{Total \, clearance \, volume}{Cylinder \, Volume} \) 
d) C.R.=\(\frac{Clearance \, volume}{Total \, cylinder \, volume} \) 
a
5. Which of the following is not an example of drawbar dynamometer?
a) Spring dynamometer
b) Hydraulic dynamometer
c) Electrical dynamometer
d) Strain gauge dynamometer
c
6. A high-speed diesel engine operating at 2000 rev/min has a single cylinder. During the compression stroke, the fuel injection starts 20° before TDC and ends at TDC. Determine the duration the fuel injection takes place.
a) 1/600 seconds
b) 2/248 seconds
c) 1/60 seconds
d) 2/319 seconds
a
Crankshaft angle/sec = \(\frac{100}{3}*\frac{360}{1}\) 
Injection time for 20° rotation = 1*\(\frac{20}{12000}\) 
= 1/600 seconds.
7. A six-cylinder 4-stroke engine has bore diameter 11 cm and stroke length 12.2 cm running at 2800 rev/min consumes 455m2 of air per hour. What would be the volumetric efficiency of the engine?
a) 75%
b) 78.7%
c) 77.8%
d) 76%
c
= \(\frac{π}{4}\)[11/100]2*[12.2/100]*2800/2*60*6
= 584.33 m2
Volumetric efficiency = \(\frac{Actual \,volume \,of \,air \,taken}{Swept \,Volume}\)*100
= \(\frac{455}{584.33}\)*100
= 77.8%.
8. A diesel engine transmits 25 KW at the end of the crankshaft, moving at 1650 rev/min, find the torque exerted by the piston.
a) 148.90 Newton-metre
b) 144.75 Newton-metre
c) 150.75 Newton-metre
d) 120.10 Newton-metre
b
25*1000=\(\frac{2π*1650*T}{60}\) 
T=144.75 Newton-metre.
9. Which of the following is not a function of a flywheel?
a) It stores energy during power stroke and returns back the same energy during the idle strokes, providing a rotary motion
b) It carries ring gear that meshes with the pinion of starting motor
c) It is used to join the connecting rod to piston
d) It serves the purpose of a pulley for transmitting power
c
10. The minimum temperature required for a liquid fuel to form a spontaneously combustible mixture is known as ____________
a) Flash point
b) Fluid coupling
c) Differential
d) Disc brake
a
