b) Ignition quality of fuel
c) Fuel supply system
d) Fuel delivery
b
8. The knock characteristics of fuel is indicated by ____________
a) Cetane number
b) Octane number
c) Calorific value
d) Fuel consumption
b
9. Diesel fuel are rated by ____________
a) Octane number
b) Cetane number

11. The formula of API degree is _______
a) \(\frac{141.5}{specific\, gravity \,of \,oil\, at\, 60℉}\) – 13.15
b) Specific gravity of oil-13.5
c) \(\frac{141.5}{specific\, gravity \,of\, oil}\)+131.5
d) \(\frac{specifc gravity of oil+41.31}{141.5} \) 
a
12. A four-stroke diesel engine operating at 800 rpm uses 0.10 kg of fuel in 4 minutes while developing a torque of 70 Nm. Calculate brake specific fuel consumption
a) 0.262 kg/kwh
b) 0.256 kg/kwh
c) 0.242 kg/kwh
d) 0.236 kg/kwh
b
Brake specific fuel consumption = \(\frac{0.10*60}{4*5.86}\) = 0.256 kg/kwh.
13. Find the weight of air for complete combustion of 10 l of petrol, assuming air contains 22.7%
a) 113.66 kg
b) 171 kg
c) 450.12 kg
d) 650 kg
a
2*86 g of petrol requires = 19*32 kg of oxygen
7300 g of petrol requires = \(\frac{19*32*7300}{2*86}\) = 25.80 kg
Amount of air required = 25.80 * 100/22.7 = 113.66.
14. An IC engine consumes high speed diesel oil at the rate of 0.5 kg/h. Calculate the power of the engine.
a) 10 KW
b) 15.45 KW
c) 6.15 KW
d) 22.15 KW
c
5275 kcal/h = 5275*4.2 k joules/hr = \(\frac{5275*4.2*1000}{6154.167} \) 
Power of engine = 6.15 KW.
