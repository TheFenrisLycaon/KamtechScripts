1. The measure of knock characteristics of a fuel is known as ______
a) Cetane number
b) Octane number
c) Calorific value
d) Volatility
b
2. What is the formula for A.P.I. degrees used in gravity tests for fuels?
a) A.P.I. degrees = \(\frac{141.5}{specific \, gravity \, of \, oil \, at \, 60°F} \)-131.5
b) A.P.I. degrees = \(\frac{131.5}{specific \, gravity \, of \, oil \, at \, 60°F} \)-141.5
c) A.P.I. degrees = \(\frac{Specific \, gravity \, of \, oil \, at \, 60°F}{141.5} \)-131.5
d) A.P.I. degrees = \(\frac{Specific \, gravity \, of \, oil \, at \, 60°F}{131.5} \)-141.5
a
3. Which component of the carburettor is used to produce low pressure in the throat of the carburettor?
a) Throttle
b) Main jet
c) Choke
d) Venturi tube
d
4. What is the range of pressure created at fuel injection pump?
a) 120 kg/cm2-300 kg/cm2
b) 106 kg/cm2-120 kg/cm2
c) 106 kg/cm2-300 kg/cm2
d) 120 kg/cm2-248 kg/cm2
a
5. Which component of the carburettor is used to maintain a constant level of fuel in the carburettor?
a) Main jet
b) Compensating jet
c) Float chamber
d) Economiser
c
6. Which component is used to supply air under pressure to the cylinders of the engine?
a) Turbocharger
b) Fuel filter
c) Fuel injector
d) Combustion chamber
a
7. An I.C. engine consumes high speed diesel oil at the rate of 0.5 kg/h. What is the power of the engine?
a) 6.51 KW
b) 6.48 KW
c) 6.10 KW
d) 6.15 KW
d
= 0.5 * 10550 (calorific value of high speed diesel = 10550 kcal/kg)
1 calorie = 4.2 joules
1 joule/sec = 1 watt
5275 kcal/h = 5275 * 4.2 k joules/h
= \(\frac{5275*4.2*1000}{60*60}\) joules/sec = \(\frac{5275*4.2*1000}{60*60} \)watts
= \(\frac{5275*4.2*1000}{60*60*1000} \) KW
Power of engine = 6.15 KW
8. A four-stroke diesel engine operating at 1200 rpm uses 0.1 kg of fuel in 5 minutes and develops a torque of 7.5 kg-m. What is the brake specific fuel consumption.
a) 0.2810 kg/BHP/h
b) 0.1910 kg/BHP/h
c) 0.1886 kg/BHP/h
d) 1.1010 kg/BHP/h
b
BHP = 6.28 hp
Brake specific fuel consumption = \(\frac{0.1}{6.28}*\frac{60}{5}\) = 0.1910 kg/BHP/h
