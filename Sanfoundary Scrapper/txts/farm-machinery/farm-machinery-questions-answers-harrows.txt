1. The flanged tube, mounted on the gang axle between every two discs to retain them at fixed position laterally on the shaft is called ______
a) Spool
b) Gang
c) Bearing
d) Scraper
a
2. Which disc harrow has two gangs in tandem and two fitted one behind the other?
a) Tractor drawn
b) Off set
c) Tandem
d) Double action
b
3. What is the size of the discs in tractor drawn disc harrows?
a) 20-30 cm diameter
b) 10-30 cm diameter
c) 90-110 cm diameter
d) 35-70 cm diameter
d
4. What is the weight of the disc harrow?
a) 80 to 100 kg
b) 30 to 50 kg
c) 10 to 40 kg
d) 23 to 56 kg
a
5. What is the range of the gang angle?
a) 29°-39°
b) 34°-56°
c) 0°-27°
d) 89°-100°
c
6. Which harrow is known as knife harrow?

d) Acme harrow
d
7. How many acres can be covered by a harrow of 1.5 m width in a day of 8 hours with bullock power. If each spike of the harrow is giving 1 kg resistance when there are 50 spikes. What power would be necessary for the bullocks to pull the harrow?
a) 0.544 KW
b) 0.987 KW
c) 0.123 KW
d) 0.333 KW
a
Area per 8 hours = 6000*8 m2 = 4.8 ha
Total draft = 50 kg
Power, KW = \(\frac{Draft*speed}{1000}=\frac{50*9.8*4*1000}{60*60*1000}\) = 0.544.
8. What power is necessary for pulling a harrow with 50 times, each giving a resistance of 1 kg, when the speed of harrow is 5km/hr.
a) 0.980 KW
b) 0.223 KW
c) 0.680 KW
d) 1.902 KW
c
Power = \(\frac{soil \, resistance*speed}{1000}=\frac{50*9.8*5*1000}{1000*60*60}\) = 0.680 KW.
