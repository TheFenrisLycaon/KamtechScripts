1. Calculate the total time required to harvest 4 hectares of grass by means of a 2mm mower being operated at the speed of 4 km/h. Assume field efficiency of mower as 75%?
a) 4.67 hr
b) 5.67 hr
c) 6.67 hr
d) 7.67 hr
c
2. What horsepower will be required to pull 1.2 m mower working at the speed of 5 km/m length of the mower ad mechanical efficiency is 85%?
a) 1.56
b) 2.56
c) 3.56
d) 4.56
a
P=\(\frac{72*5*1000}{75*3600}\) = 1.33 HP
Actual power = 1.33/0.85 = 1.56 HP.
3. How many hectares of grass per day of 15 hours can be cut by a mower being operated at the speed of 4.5 km/h and with 4 m cutter bar.
a) 20
b) 22
c) 27
d) 16
c
Fc=\(\frac{4.5*4}{10}\) = 1.8 ha/hr
Area covered in 15 hours = 1.8*15 = 27 ha.
4. A mower has driven wheel of 60 cm diameter. The crank of mower makes 550 rpm, when it is driven by a tractor at a speed of 2 km/h. If speed ratio between the crank wheel and land wheel is changed to 27:1, calculate the increase in speed of mower to maintain the same speed of crank.
a) 0.20 km/h
b) 0.304 km/h
c) 1.402 km/h
d) 1.36 km/h
b
\(\frac{Nc}{Nl}=\frac{27}{1} \) 
Nl=\(\frac{Nc}{27}=\frac{550}{27}\) = 20.38 rpm
Linear speed of mower, V = \(\frac{πDNc}{60} = \frac{π*0.6*20.38}{60}\) = 0.640 = \(\frac{0.640*3600}{1000}\) = 2.304 km/h
Increase in speed = V2 – V1 = 2.304-2 = 0.304 km/h.
5. A 2m mower is operating at 3.5 km/h with an overall efficiency of 75%. Calculate the area covered by it in ha/h.
a) 0.525
b) 0.625
c) 0.725
d) 0.825
a
6. How many revolutions will each spindle of cotton picker make in the picking zone for a chain belt arrangement in which the speed of spindle is 1400 rpm and remains in the picking zone during 100 cm of forward travel.
a) 50
b) 21
c) 45
d) 11
b
Time required to move 100 cm = \(\frac{100*60}{4.5*10^3*100}\) = 0.015 m
Number of revolutions in 0.015 min duration = 1400*0.015 = 21 revolutions.
7. A disc type mower is operated by PTO with 6 discs with a shaft of 0.4 m/disc. The specific energy required for cutting is 2.1 KJ/m2 and specific power losses due to air come stubble and gear train friction is 2 kw/m of cutting width. If the mower with tractor requires a propelling force of 2 KN the total power requirement for carrying out moving in Kw at forward speed of 3 km/h is ____
a) 10.67
b) 20.67
c) 30.67
d) 40.67
a
Ppropelling = \(\frac{2*1000*3*1000}{3600}\) = 1.67 KW
Ptotal = 4.8+4.2+1.67 = 10.67 KW.
8. The most common mower, amongst the following is ___________
a) Reciprocating mower
b) Lawn mower
c) Cylindrical mower
d) Horizontal mower
a
9. A gang mower is the group of ___________
a) 2 or more cylindrical mowers
b) 5 mowers
c) 2 mowers
d) 10 mowers
a
10. In flail mower, the cutting section contains ___________
a) Cutter bar
b) Swinging knives
c) Fixed knives
d) Reciprocating fingers only
b
11. In cutter bar of mower, the knife head is attached to the ___________
a) Knife back
b) Cutter end
c) Starting point of cutting edge
d) Reciprocating fingers
a
12. In mower, the grass board is provided at the ___________
a) Cutter end
b) Knife end
c) Knife back
d) Reciprocating fingers
a
13. In cutter bar of mower, the knife sections are revitted to the ___________
a) Knife back
b) Reciprocating fingers
c) Stationary bar
d) Cylindrical drum
a
14. In mower, the pitman transmits the motion to the ___________
a) Knife head
b) Knife middle
c) Knife back
d) Knife end
a
15. Who invented the first lawn mower?
a) Albert Einstein
b) Buzz Aldrin
c) Edwin Budding
d) Yuri Gagarin
c
