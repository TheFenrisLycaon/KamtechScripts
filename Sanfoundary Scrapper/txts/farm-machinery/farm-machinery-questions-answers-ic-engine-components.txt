1. Rapid explosion of air-fuel mixture within the cylinder, when ignited by a spark is known as _______
a) constant heat combustion
b) constant pressure combustion
c) constant volume combustion
d) cut off ratio
c
2. Which is largest piston driven aircraft having 36 cylinders?
a) DKW
b) Lycoming R-7755
c) Saab 92
d) Pratt and Whitney R-4360
b
3. Which of the following is an indicator of the combustion speed of diesel fuel and compression needed for ignition?
a) Cetane Number
b) Octane Number
c) Calorific Value
d) Pre-Ignition
a
4. A four-stroke diesel engine operating at 1200 rpm uses 0.1 kg of fuel in 5 minutes and has the brake specific fuel consumption equals to 0.1910 kg\BHP\h. Calculate the torque developed.
a) 6.5 kg-m
b) 8 kg-m
c) 7.5 kg-m
d) 5 kg-m
c
BHP = 2πpT/4500
= 0.837T
Break Sp. Fuel Consumption = 0.1*60/0.837T*5
0.1910 = 0.1/0.837T*5
T=7.5 kg-m.
5. In which of the following condition the engine is known as over-square engine?
a) d < L
b) d > L
c) d=0
d) L=0
b
6. Find the weight of air for complete combustion of 10 litres of petrol assuming air contains 22.7% oxygen.
a) 106.10 kg
b) 120kg
c) 113.67 kg
d) 115.79 kg
c
Density of petrol = 0.77 g/cc
Mass = 10*1000*0.73
7300 g petrol = 19*32*7300/2*86
= 25.80 kg
Amount of air required = 25.80*100/22.7
= 113.67 kg.
7. The pipe which connects the intake system to the inlet valve of the engine and through which air or air-fuel mixture is drawn into the cylinder is known as _______
a) Spark Plug
b) Connecting Rod
c) Camshaft
d) Inlet Manifold
d
8. Who invented two-stroke engine in 1878?
a) Dugald Clark
b) Nikola Tesla
c) Carl Sagan
d) William Henry Bragg
a
9. The mechanical efficiency of a single cylinder four-stroke engine is 80%. The frictional power is estimated to be 25. Calculate the indicated and brake power developed by the engine.
a) 106 kW;120 kW
b) 125 kW;100 kW
c) 120 kW;106 kW
d) 100 kW;125 kW
b
Indicated power-brake power = 25
Indicated power-0.8*indicated power
Indicated power = 125 kW
Brake power=100 Kw.
10. If L is the stroke and N is the rpm, mean piston speed of two stroke engine is _______
a) LN
b) LN/2
c) 2LN
d) 2LN/3
c
