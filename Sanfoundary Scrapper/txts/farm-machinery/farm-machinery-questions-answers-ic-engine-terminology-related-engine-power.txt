c
6. A four cylinder two- stroke cycle engine with a swept volume of 750 cm3 per cylinder gives a specific fuel consumption of 0.25 kg KW-1 h-1. When developing a brake mean effective mean pressure 650 kPa at 1500 rpm. What is the brake thermal efficiency, if the calorific value is 40 MJ kg-1?
a) 9%
b) 18%
c) 32%
d) 36%
d
Brake power = \(\frac{pLAN*n}{60000} \) 
B.P. = \(\frac{650∗750∗10^{−6}∗1500∗ 4∗10^3}{60000} \) 
B.P. = 48.75 KW
Brake thermal efficiency = \(\frac{B.P.*60}{Wf*Cf} \) 
B.T.E. = \(\frac{48.75∗60}{0.203∗40∗10^3} \) 
B.T.E. = 36%.

Where, W is the dead load
S is the spring balanced
D is the diameter of the wheel
‘d’ is the diameter of the rope.
