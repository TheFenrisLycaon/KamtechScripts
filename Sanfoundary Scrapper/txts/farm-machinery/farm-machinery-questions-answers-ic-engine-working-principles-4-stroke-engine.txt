1. What is the degree of crank rotation during the completion of a four-stroke cycle?
a) 90°
b) 279°
c) 180°
d) 360°
c
2. What is the compression ratio in SI engine?
a) 6 – 10
b) 3 – 5
c) 1 – 2
d) 11 – 15
a
3. What is the firing order of a four cylinder engines?
a) 1-3-4-2
b) 1-4-3-2
c) 1-2-3-4
d) 4-3-2-1
a
4. Which of the following describes the firing interval in a four-stroke engine?
a) F.I. = 720°/Number of cylinders
b) F.I. = 360°/Number of cylinders
c) F.I. = 270°/Number of cylinders
d) F.I. = 180°/Number of cylinders
a
5. What is the efficiency of compressed charge engine?
a) 40%
b) 20%
c) 30%
d) 10%
c
6. Diameter and stroke length of the piston of a 4 stroke-4-cylinder diesel engine are 10 cm and 12 cm respectively and speed of crank shaft is 2000 rpm. Calculate brake power.
a) 18.90 KW
b) 12.89 KW
c) 12.98 KW
d) 18.98 KW
d
= \(\frac{7*105*0.12*\frac{π}{4}*(0.1)2*2000*4}{60000*2}\) 
= 43.98 KW
Brake power = Integrated power – Frictional power
= 43.98-25
= 18.98 KW.
7. A six-cylinder engine has 130 mm stroke and 109.4 mm bore. The displacement of the engine at a compression ratio is 17:1 is equal to _________
a) 5.4 litres
b) 7.32 litres
c) 8.27 litres
d) 6.96 litres
b
=\(\frac{π}{4}\)*(109.4)2*130*6
=7.32 litres.
8. What per cent of supplied energy is converted into mechanical work by an IC engine?
a) 10%-20%
b) 30%-40%
c) 50%-60%
d) 70%-80%
b
