1. Mysto hand is a type of which sprayer?
a) Stirrup pump type
b) Hand atomiser type
c) Bucket sprayer
d) Boom type field sprayer
b
2. Which sprayer is carried on the back of the operator?
a) Knapsack type
b) Stirrup pump type
c) Rocket sprayer
d) Bucket sprayer
a
3. Vane type or Propeller type are which type of pump?
a) Piston pump
b) Centrifugal pump
c) High volume pump
d) Rotary pump
d
4. What will be the water power which is required to discharge liquid at the rate of 30 litres/min at 30 kg/cm2 pressure?
a) 2.39 KW
b) 9.86 KW
c) 1.47 KW
d) 2.08 KW
c
Water power = \(\frac{30*9.8}{60}*\frac{30*10}{1000} \) = 1.47 KW
5. Find the suction capacity of a power sprayer if diameter is 25 m, speed is 1100 rev/min length of stroke is 22 mm, number of plunger is 3.
a) 35.61 l/min
b) 23.90 l/min
c) 56.89 l/min
d) 35.47 l/min
a
Total suction capacity = 11.87 * 3
= 35.61 l/min
6. Hand atomizer is used for spraying in _______
a) orchard
b) field crop
c) nursery
d) forests
c
7. At where is the pressure lower when the chemical travels through the rubber hose?
a) At the discharge part of the power sprayer
b) At the end of the hose
c) At the swirl plate
d) At the spray gun
b
8. What is pump efficiency?
a) P.E. = Water Horse Power * Shaft Horse Power
b) P.E. = Water Horse Power – Shaft Horse Power
c) P.E. = Water Horse Power + Shaft Horse Power
d) P.E. = \(\frac{Water \, Horse \, Power}{Shaft \, Horse \, Power} \) 
d
9. The distance from the source water surface to the output of the pump is known as _________
a) total head
b) crank handle
c) nozzle
d) flow rate
a
10. In a pump, suction volume is 25 litres/min and the pump efficiency is 85%. Calculate the shaft power at a pressure of 35kg/cm2
a) 2.65 KW
b) 3.45 KW
c) 1.67 KW
d) 1.10 KW
c
Shaft Power = \(\frac{1.42}{0.85} \) = 1.67 KW
