1. The comparative strength of tyre is indicated by ___________
a) Ply rating
b) Thickness
c) Materials of construction
d) Size and tyre width
a
2. In tyre size of 12-38’’, the number 38’’ represents _____
a) Sectional diameter of rim on which tyre is to be mounted
b) Ply rating
c) Sectional diameter
d) Strength of tyre
a
This could be understood by an example, 215/60R15 where, 215 is the width of the tyre in millimetres. 60 is the tyre profile. Radial construction is denoted by R. Diameter of the wheel rim in inches is 15.
3. Inflation pressure in rear wheel of tractor varies between ___________
a) 0.8-1.5 kg/cm2
b) 1.5-2.0 kg/cm2
c) 2.0-2.5 kg/cm2
d) 2.5-3.0 kg/cm2
a
4. The useful life of pneumatic tyres under normal operating condition for drawbar works is about ___________
a) 10000 hrs
b) 6000 hrs
c) 2000 hrs
d) 1500 hrs
b
5. In traction, the front wheel acts as ___________
a) Drive wheel
b) Caster wheel
c) Steered wheel
d) Track wheel
c
6. The term toe-in is associated to ___________
a) Front axle of tractor
b) Rear axle of tractor
c) Carburettor
d) Ignition chamber
a
7. Ground clearance of tractor is measured under ___________
a) Maximum permissible load condition
b) Without loading condition
c) Normal loading condition
d) Medium loading condition
a
8. During tractor running the tyre slippage can be controlled by ___________
a) Increase tractor speed
b) Decreasing load of tractor
c) Increasing co-efficient of traction
d) Decreasing pressure of tyre
c
Usable traction = coefficient of traction x normal force.
9. The angle between centre line of tyre and vertical line is called ___________
a) Caster angle
b) Camber angle
c) Tilt angle
d) Bearings
b
10. The wheel type tractor is not suitable for ___________
a) Low ground pressure
b) High ground pressure
c) Undulate land
d) Road transport
a
11. Excessive vibration of tyre is ___________
a) Swinging
b) Wobbling
c) Repositioning
d) Slipping
b
12. Range 2° to 4° is of _______
a) Caster angle
b) Camber angle
c) King pin inclination
d) Slipping
b
13. If the inner and outer steering angles in a tractor are 9° and 9.8° respectively then for correct steering condition the value of the ratio of pivot axis spacing to travel length is equal to ____
a) 0.256
b) 0.525
c) 0.756
d) 0.990
b
Cot 9 – cot 9.8 = c/b
c/b = 0.525.
14. A motor has a wheel base of 2.73 m and pivot centre of 1.065 m. the rear and front wheel track is 1.217 m. calculate turning circle radius of the outer front and inner rear wheels when the angle of inside lock is 40° and outside lock is 32°.
a) 7.25 m:4.18 m
b) 6.25 m: 2.18 m
c) 5.25 m: 3.18 m
d) 4.25 m: 1.18 m
c
Rf = \(\frac{b}{sin⁡φ}+\frac{a-c}{2}=\frac{2.743}{sin⁡32}+\frac{1.217-1.065}{2}\) = 5.25 m
Turning radius of inner radius wheel Rr = b cot φ – (a-c)/2 = 3.18 m.
15. When did tractors started using rubber tyres?
a) 1857
b) 1933
c) 1989
d) 2003
b
