1. If a diesel engine has a compression ratio of 24 and the cut-off takes place at 5% of stroke, the air standard efficiency will be ___________
a) 60.66%
b) 64.50%
c) 66.60%
d) 65.40%
c
V1 = 24 V2
V3 = V2 + 0.05 (V1-V2)
V3 = V2 + 0.05(24 V2-V2)
V3/V2 = 2.15
Efficiency: 1 – (1/r)γ-1 * [rcγ – 1] / r [rc – 1] 
= 1 – (1/24)1.4-1 [2.151.4 – 1] / 1.4 [2.15-1] 
= 66.60%.
2. Whenever a system undergoes a cyclic change, the algebraic sum of work transfer is proportional to the algebraic sum of heat transfer as work and heat are mutually convertible. Which law of thermodynamics suggests this?
a) Zeroth law of thermodynamics
b) Second law of thermodynamics
c) Third law of thermodynamics
d) First law of thermodynamics
d
3. The end of the connecting rod which fits over the gudgeon pin is known as __________ connecting rod.
a) Small end
b) Big end
c) Piston
d) Cylinder block
a
4. The ratio of the actual weight of air induced by the engine in the intake stroke to the theoretical weight of air that should have been induced due to piston displacement at intake temperature and pressure is known as ___________
a) Efficiency ratio
b) Volumetric efficiency
c) Mechanical efficiency
d) Indicated thermal efficiency
b
5. A four-cylinder tractor engine develops 50 KW at 3000 engines when tested on a prony dynamometer on brake arm length of 96 cm. What is the torque?
a) 190.98 Nm
b) 159.15 Nm
c) 186.49 Nm
d) 155.28 Nm
b
T = 50*60000/ 2π*3000
T = 3000000/2*3.14*3000
T = 3000000/18840
T = 159.15 Nm.
6. Who found the working principle of compression ignition engine in 1982?
a) Rudolf Diesel
b) Johannes Gutenberg
c) Otto von Guericke
d) Edwin Beard Budding
a
7. What is the correct sequence of strokes in four stroke cycle engines?
a) Compression, Suction, Exhaust, Power
b) Power, Suction, Exhaust, Compression
c) Suction, Compression, Power, Exhaust
d) Suction, Power, Compression, Exhaust
c
8. Who created the first modern internal combustion engine in 1876?
a) Etienne Lenoir
b) Nikolaus Otto
c) John Barber
d) John Stevens
b
9. What is the regulation of speed when speed at no load of engine is 1973 rpm and speed at load is 1873 rpm?
a) 5.20%
b) 4.80%
c) 5.12%
d) 4.56%
a
∆N = N2-N1
∆N = 1973-1873 = 100rpm
 N = N2-N1/2
 N = 1973+1873/2
= 1923
Regulation of speed = ∆N/  N
                                    = 100/ 1923
                                    = 0.0520
                                    = 5.20%.
10. What is the net-work for the following cyclic process?
+14.7 KJ, -25.2 KJ, -3.56 KJ, +31.5 KJ
a) 19.35 KJ
b) 12.09 KJ
c) 17.44 KJ
d) 10.35 KJ
c
∂Qnet = (14.7 – 25.2 – 3.56 + 31.5)
∂Qnet = 17.44 KJ.
11. The clearance between rocker arm and valve stem that enables the valves to sit properly is known as _____________
a) Valve lifter guide
b) Valve stem guide
c) Cam gear
d) Tappet clearance
d
