1. What is molar heat capacity (C)?
a) C = Specific heat * Molecular weight of gas
b) C = Specific heat + Molecular weight of gas
c) C = Specific heat – Molecular weight of gas
d) C = \(\frac{Specific\, heat}{Molecular\, weight\, of\, gas} \) 
a
2. The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of substance through 1°C is known as ________
a) Internal energy
b) Molar heat capacity
c) Specific heat
d) Heat enthalpy
c
Q=cm∆T
Where c is the specific heat. The relationship does not apply if a phase change is encountered, because the heat added or removed during a phase change does not change temperature.
3. The lower part of a crankcase is commonly known as _______
a) Oil pan
b) Dry liner
c) Wet liner
d) Skirt
a
4. What is the range of angles made between common face and seat angle of valve?
a) 50°-60°
b) 30°-45°
c) 70°-85°
d) 10°-20°
b
5. How many kilopascals are there in 1 kg/cm2?
a) 89 kPa
b) 76 kPa
c) 98 kPa
d) 69 kPa
c
1 N.m. = 1 Joule
1 N. m/s = 1 Joule/s = 1 Watt
1 kg/cm2 = 9.8 * 104 N/m2 = 9.8 * 104 Pa = 98 kPa
6. What is the stroke-bore ratio for tractor engines?
a) 1
b) 1.45
c) 0.25
d) 1.25
d
7. What is the compression ratio of an engine whose dimensions are 100*120 mm and length of clearance space at the top dead centre being 8 mm?
a) 16:1
b) 32:1
c) 1:16
d) 1:32
a
Height of clearance space = 0.8 cm
Clearance volume= area * height = \(\frac{π}{4}\)*102*0.8
= 62.8 cm3
Total volume = \(\frac{π}{4}\)*D2*L
= \(\frac{π}{4}\)*102*12.8 = 1004.8 cm3
Compression ratio = \(\frac{Total \, volume}{Clearance \, volume}\) 
= \(\frac{1004.8}{62.8}\) = 16/1
= 16:1
8. A fuel contains 84% carbon and 16% hydrogen by mass. The necessary air- fuel ratio for chemically correct combustion is _______
a) 10.42: 1
b) 15.30: 1
c) 20.36: 1
d) 31.08: 1
b
Molecular weight of CxHy = 12x+y
According to question: \(\frac{12x}{12x+y}\)*100 = 84
And \(\frac{y}{12x+y}\)*100 = 16
By solving the above equations, we get; x=7 and y=16
Thus, formula for fuel is C7H16
C7H16 (12*7 + 1*16=100) + 11O2(11*16*2=352) = 7CO2 + 8H20
\(\frac{Air}{Fuel} = \frac{352}{100*0.23}\) = 15.3:1
9. Which component of I.C. engine is also known as ‘half time gear’?
a) Timing gear
b) Crankcase
c) Flywheel
d) Tappet
a
