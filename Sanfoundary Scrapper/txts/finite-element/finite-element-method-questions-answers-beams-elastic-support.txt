6. Which of the following expressions must be added to the element stiffness matrix for beams supported on elastic supports, where l is length of beam element, and s is the stiffness per unit length of element?
a) \(\frac{sl}{420}\begin{bmatrix}156&22l&54&-13l\\22l&4l^2&13l&-3l^2\\54&13l&156&-22l\\-13l&-3l^2&-22l&4l^2\end{bmatrix}\)  
b) \(\frac{EI}{l^2}\begin{bmatrix}12&-6l&-12&6l\\-6l&4l^2&6l&2l^2\\-12&6l&12&6l\\6l&2l^2&6l&4l^2\end{bmatrix}\) 
c) \(\frac{EI}{l^3}\begin{bmatrix}12&-6l&-12&6l\\-6l&4l^2&6l&2l^2\\-12&6l&12&6l\\6l&2l^2&6l&4l^2\end{bmatrix}\) 
d) \(\frac{EI}{420}\begin{bmatrix}156&22l&54&-13l\\22l&4l^2&13l&-3l^2\\54&13l&156&-22l\\-13l&-3l^2&-22l&4l^2\end{bmatrix}\) 
a
\(\frac{sl}{420}\begin{bmatrix}156&22l&54&-13l\\22l&4l^2&13l&-3l^2\\54&13l&156&-22l\\-13l&-3l^2&-22l&4l^2\end{bmatrix}\) 
Here l is length of beam element, and s is the stiffness per unit length of element. The stiffness matrix of the beam element affects the displacement of the nodes and their interpolation in the beam element.
