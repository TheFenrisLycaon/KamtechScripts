d
5. Which of the following boundary conditions cannot be directly applied on solid elements?
a) Force
b) Pressure
c) Support
d) Torque
d
6. Traction is force acting on an area in any direction other than normal.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Which of the following statements is correct?
a) Reaction force at supports is equal to the sum of the product of stiffness and displacement
b) Reaction force at supports is equal to the product of sum of stiffness and displacement
c) Reaction force at supports is equal to the sum of stiffness’s
d) Reaction force at supports is equal to the sum of displacements
a
8. Which of the following equations give the relation between material properties like modulus of elasticity (E), modulus of rigidity (G), and Poisson’s ratio (u)?
a) E = 2*G*(1+u)
b) E = 3*G*(1+u)
c) E = 2*G*(1-u)
d) E = 3*G*(1-u)
a
E = 2*G*(1+u)
Here E is the ratio of normal stress to normal strain. G is the ratio of shear stress to shear strain and u is the ratio of lateral strain to longitudinal strain.
