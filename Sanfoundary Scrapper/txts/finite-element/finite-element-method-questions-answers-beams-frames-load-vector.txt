1. On a simply supported beam with uniformly distributed load (p) over length (l) the value of reaction force at one support is _______
a) p*l
b) (p*l)/2
c) (p*l)2
d) (p*l)/3
b
The reaction force at one of the two supports=(p*l)/2.
2. In Galerkin method we convert a continuous operator problem into a discrete problem.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Which of the following is not a one dimensional element?
a) bar
b) brick
c) beam
d) rod
b
4. Three geometrically identical beams made out of steel, aluminum, and titanium are axially loaded. Which of the following statements is correct?
a) Stress in titanium is the least
b) Stress in cast iron is the highest
c) Stress in steel is the least
d) Stress in all three beams is the same
d
5. The application of force at which of the following point on a beam will nullify the effect of torsion?
a) Centroid
b) Center of mass
c) Extreme fiber
d) Shear centre
d
6. For a taper beam element two cross sections are necessary to define the geometry.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Which of the following statements is correct?
a) Beam elements are recommended for unsymmetrical cross sections
b) Bar elements are recommended for unsymmetrical cross sections
c) Beam and bar elements can both be used for unsymmetrical cross sections
d) Neither beam nor bar elements can be used for unsymmetrical cross sections
a
8. The equivalent load (f) acting on a simply supported beam element loaded with uniformly distributed load (p) over an element of length (l) is given by which of the following expressions?
a) f=\([\frac{pl}{2},\frac{pl^2}{12},\frac{pl}{2},-\frac{pl^2}{12}]\) 
b) f=\([\frac{pl}{2},\frac{pl^2}{12},\frac{pl}{2},\frac{pl^2}{12}]\) 
c) f=\([\frac{pl}{2},-\frac{pl^2}{12},\frac{pl}{2},-\frac{pl^2}{12}]\) 
d) f=\([\frac{pl}{2},\frac{pl^2}{12},\frac{-pl}{2},-\frac{pl^2}{12}]\) 
a
    f=\([\frac{pl}{2},\frac{pl^2}{12},\frac{pl}{2},-\frac{pl^2}{12}]\) 
Here l is length of beam element, and p is the uniformly distributed load. Here \(\frac{pl}{2}\) represents the reaction force on the supports, and \(\frac{pl^2}{12}\)  represents the moment acting on the supports.
