1. For fluid flows, which expression does not characterize the slow flow of a viscous and incompressible fluid in a closed domain?
a) v.∇v=0
b) μ≠0
c) =0
d) =0
d
Slow (inertial effects are negligible): v.∇v=0.
Viscous: μ≠0.
Incompressible: =0.
It is not a uniform flow; thus, ≠0.
2. In mathematical modeling, for which option, a fluid flow can be approximated by a two-dimensional model?
a) One of the dimensions is very small, and there is some flow along with it
b) One of the dimensions is very long, and there is no flow along with it
c) One of the dimensions is very long, and there is some flow along with it
d) The velocity components in two directions vary along the third direction
b
3. For fluid flows obeying conservation of mass, what is the value of k if v=4x+ky denotes the velocity at any point in the flow?
a) -4
b) 4
c) -2
d) 2
a
Using the conservation of mass, we get  \(\frac{\partial (4x)}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial (ky)}{\partial y}\)=0
4+k=0
K=-4.
4. The following equation represents the momentum equation for a fluid flow that is approximated by a two-dimensional model. What does k stand for?
 ρ\(\frac{\partial v_x}{\partial t}-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}(2k\frac{\partial v_x}{\partial x})-\frac{\partial}{\partial y}[k(\frac{\partial v_x}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial v_y}{\partial x})]+\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}\)-fx=0

c) Density
d) Pressure

6. In the formulation of the finite element model for fluids flows, which option is not correct about the penalty formulation?

b) The constraint is satisfied in an approximate sense
c) Uses the penalty function method
d) Involves natural and direct formulation of momentum and continuity equations
