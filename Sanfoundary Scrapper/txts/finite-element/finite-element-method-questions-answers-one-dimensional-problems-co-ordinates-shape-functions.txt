1. Natural or intrinsic coordinate system is used to define ___________
a) Co-ordinates
b) Shape functions
c) Displacement functions
d) Both shape functions and co-ordinate functions
b
2. In q=[q1,q2]T  is defined as __________
a) Element displacement vector
b) Element vector
c) Displacement vector
d) Shape function vector
a
3. Shape function is just a ___________
a) Displacement function
b) Equation
c) Interpolation function
d) Matrix function
c
4. Isoparametric formula is ______________
a) x=N1x1+N2x2
b) x=N2x1+N1x2
c) x=N1x1-N2x2
d) x=N2x1-N1x2
a
 x=N1x1+N2x2
Here both displacement u and co-ordinate x are interpolated within the element using shape functions N1 and N2. This is called isoparametric formulation in literature.
5. B=\(\frac{1}{x_2-x_1}\)[-1 1]  is an ___________
a) Strain matrix
b) Element-strain displacement matrix
c) Displacement matrix
d) Elemental matrix
b
 Here B is element strain displacement matrix. Use of linear shape functions results in a constant B matrix. Hence, in a constant strain within the element. The stress from Hooke’s law is
σ=EBq.

6. Deformation at the end of elements are called _____________
a) Load
b) Displacement functions
c) Co-ordinates
d) Nodes
d
7. Write the shape function of the given element.
	u= N1u1(e)+N2u2(e). Here N1 & N2 are
a) N1=1-x/le&N2=x/le
b) N1=x/le&N2=1-x/le
c) N1=0 & N2=x
d) N1=x & N2=0
a

1			             2 --- local variables
I			             j --- global variables
u1(e)	                             u2(e)
x1=0			     x2=0
Then matrix notation form is
u=\(\begin{bmatrix} 1 & x \end{bmatrix}\begin{Bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \end{Bmatrix}\) 
u1(e)=c1+c2(0)=c1
u2(e)= c1+c2(le)
In matrix equation
\(\begin{Bmatrix}u_1 \\ u_2 \end{Bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\ 1 & l_e \end{bmatrix} \begin{Bmatrix}c_1 \\ c_2 \end{Bmatrix}\) 
By solving we get
N1=1-x/le& N2=x/le.
