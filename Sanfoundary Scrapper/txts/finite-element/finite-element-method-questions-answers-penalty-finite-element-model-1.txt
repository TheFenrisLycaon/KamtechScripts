We have D1=\(\begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\\\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\end{bmatrix}\) and w=\(\begin{bmatrix}2x\\3y\end{bmatrix}\) 
\(D_1^T w=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}&\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}2x\\3y\end{bmatrix}\) 
= \(\frac{\partial (3y)}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial (2x)}{\partial x}\)
