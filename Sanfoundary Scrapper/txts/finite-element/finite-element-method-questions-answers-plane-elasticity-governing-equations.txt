d
3. For a plane strain problem, which strain value is correct if the problem is characterized by the displacement field ux=ux(x,y), uy=uy(x,y) and uz=0?
a) εxy=0
b) εxz=0
c) εyz≠0
d) εxz≠0
b
 \(\epsilon_{xz}=\epsilon_{yz}=\epsilon_{zz}=0, \epsilon_{xx}=\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}, 2\epsilon_{xy}=\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}\) and \(\epsilon_{yy}=\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}\).
4. Underplane strain condition, what is the value of εyy if the problem is characterized by the displacement field ux=2x+3y, uy=5y2, and uz=0?
a) 10y
b) 5y
c) 3
d) 0
a
\(\epsilon_{xz}=\epsilon_{yz}=\epsilon_{zz}=0, \epsilon_{xx}=\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x}, 2\epsilon_{xy}=\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x}\) and \(\epsilon_{yy}=\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}\) 
Thus, \(\epsilon_{yy}=\frac{\partial 5y^2}{\partial y}\) 
=5*\(\frac{\partial y^2}{\partial y}\) 
=5*2y
=10y.
5.For a plane strain problem, the relation between stress and strain components for an orthotropic material is σ=Cε. Which option is the correct structure of the matrix C?
a) \(\begin{pmatrix}\bar{c}_{11} & \bar{c}_{12} & 0 \\\bar{c}_{12} & \bar{c}_{22} & 0 \\0 & 0 & \bar{c}_{66} \end{pmatrix}\) 
b) \(\begin{pmatrix}\bar{c}_{11} & 0 & \bar{c}_{13} \\\bar{c}_{12} & \bar{c}_{22} & 0 \\0 & 0 & \bar{c}_{66} \end{pmatrix}\) 
c) \(\begin{pmatrix}\bar{c}_{11} & \bar{c}_{12} & 0 \\-\bar{c}_{12} & \bar{c}_{22} & 0 \\0 & 0 & \bar{c}_{66} \end{pmatrix}\) 
d) \(\begin{pmatrix}\bar{c}_{11} & -\bar{c}_{12} & 0 \\\bar{c}_{12} & \bar{c}_{22} & 0 \\0 & 0 & \bar{c}_{66} \end{pmatrix}\)

6. For an orthotropic material, if E and v represent Young’s modulus and the poisons ratio, respectively, then what is the value of v12 if E1=200 Gpa, E2=160 Gpa and v21=0.25?
a) 0.3125
b) 0.05
c) 0.2125
d) 0.3
a
v12=v21\(\frac{E_1}{E_2}\).
v12=0.25*\(\frac{200}{160}\) 
=0.25*1.25
=0.3125.
7. Under plane stress condition in the XYZ Cartesian system, which stress value is correct if a problem is characterized by the stress field σxx=σxx(x,y), σyy=σyy(x,y) and σzz=0?
a) σxy=0
b) σyx≠0
c) σzx≠0
d) σyz≠0
b
σxz=σyz=σzz=0, σxx(x,y), σxy=σxy(x,y) and σyy=σyy(x,y).
Thus, σxx , σxy and σyy are non-zero stresses. Such a problem in three dimensions can be dealt with as a two-dimensional (plane) problem.
