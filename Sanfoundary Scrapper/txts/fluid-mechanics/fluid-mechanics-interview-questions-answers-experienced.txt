1. A Hydraulic press has a ram of 30 cm diameter and a plunger of of 2 cm diameter. It is used for lifting a weight of 35 kN. Find the force required at the plunger.
a) 233.3 kN
b) 311.1 kN
c) 466.6 kN
d) 155.5 kN
d
                       F=(35000*3.142*.02*.02)/(3.142*0.3*0.3)
                         =155.5 kN. 
2. The pressure at a point in the fluid is 4.9 N/cm2. Find height when the fluid under consideration is in oil of specific gravity of 0.85.
a) 5.83 m
b) 11.66 m
c) 17.49 m
d) 8.74 m
a
                               =48620/850*9.81
                               =5.83 m. 
3. An open tank contains water upto a depth of 350 cm and above it an oil of specific gravity 0.65 for a depth of 2.5 m. Find the pressure intensity at the extreme bottom of the tank.
a) 5.027 N/cm2
b) 10.05 N/cm2
c)  2.51 N/cm2
d) None of the mentioned
a
                       = 5.027 N/cm2. 
4. The diameters of a small piston and a large piston of a hydraulic jack are 45 mm  and 100 mm respectively.Force of 0.09 kN applied on smaller in size piston. Find load lifted by piston if smaller in size piston is 40 cm above the large piston. The density of fluid is 850 kg/m3
a) 60 N/cm2
b) 12 N/cm2
c) 30  N/cm2
d) None of the mentioned
a
                                         =850*9.81*0.4 + 90/3.142*0.045*0.045
                                         =60 N/cm2.
