c) 1419 kN/m2
d) None of the mentioned
a
                     n=M/m
                     P=(9*8314*293)/28.97=946 kN/m2.

a) 708.23
b) 354.11
c) 531.17
d) 1062.34
a
8. A cylinder of 0.8 m3 in volume contains superheated steam at 70℃  and .4 N/m2 absolute pressure. The superheated steam is compressed to .3 . Find pressure and temperature.
a) 0.74 N/m2, 422.3℃
b) 1.48 N/m2, 422.3℃
c) 0.74 N/m2, 844.6℃
d) 1.48 N/m2, 844.6℃
a
                      P2=(v1/v2)n *P1
                          =(0.8/0.3)1.3 * 0.4                    ……..(for superheated stream n=1.3)
                          =.74 N/m2
                      T1=P1v1/nR=422.3℃.
9. Determine the compressibility of an incompressible fluid, if the pressure of the fluid is changed from 70 N/m2 to 130 N/m2. The volume of the liquid changes by 0.15 percent.
a) 0.0025 m2/N
b) 0.0050 m2/N
c) 0.0070 m2/N
d) 0.0012 m2/N
a
                                           =1/K
                                   K=(dp*V/dv)
                                     =60/0.15
                                     =400
                     Compressibility=.0025.
10. What is the variation of cp, cv and k in case of gases when the temperature increases?
a) cp and cv decreases with temperature, and k increases
b) cp and cv increase with temperature, and k decreases
c) cp and cv increase with temperature, and k increases
d) cp and cv decreases with temperature, and k decreases
b
Same is for cv, cp is molar heat capacity at constant volume.
However cp-cv=R and cp/cv = R
Hence, as cp, cv increases R decreases.
