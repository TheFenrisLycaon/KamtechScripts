1. A solid cylinder of diameter 5.0 m has a height of 6.0 m. Find the meta-centric height of the cylinder if the specific gravity of the material of cylinder 0.45 and it is floating in water with its axis vertical. State whether the equilibrium is stable or unstable.
a) -0.29 m
b) -0.61 m
c) -1.16 m
d) 0.14 m
b
                     Metacentric height=I/∀ -BG
                     I=π*r⁴=π*2.5⁴
                     ∀=π*r*r*h=π*2.5*2.5*6
                     Metacentric height=-0.61.
2. A solid cylinder of 15 cm diameter and 40 cm long, consists of two parts made of different materials. The first part at the base is 1.5 cm long and of specific gravity=6.5. The other part of the cylinder is made of the material having specific gravity 0.75. State, if the it can float vertically in water.
a) It will float
b) It will not float
c) Data insufficient
d) None of the mentioned
a
                   = 14.52
By principle of buoyancy,
Weight of cylinder = Weight of water displaced
h=38.625
AB=19.31
BG=14.25-19.31= -4.79
GM= Metacentric height=I/∀ -BG
      = 6.16
As metacentric height is positive, it will float.
3. A wooden cylinder of sp.gr. = 0.6 and circular in cross-section is required to float in oil(sp.gr. = 0.90). Find the L/D ratio for the cylinder to float with its longitudinal axis vertical in oil, where L is the height of cylinder and D is its diameter.
a) L/D<9/16
b) L/D<3/4
c) L/D<2/3
d) None of the mentioned
b
Weight of cylinder = Weight of water displaced
h=2L/3
AG=L/2
AB=L/3
BG=AG-AB=L/6
GM= Metacentric height=I/∀ – BG=3D2/32L-L/6
For stable equilibrium, GM should be positive
GM>0
i.e L/D<3/4.
4. A cylinder(uniform density distribution) of  radius 3.0 m has a height of 9.0 m. The specific gravity of the material of cylinder 0.85 and it is floating in water with its axis vertical. State whether the equilibrium is stable or unstable.
a) Stable
b) Unstable
c) Insufficient Data
d) None of the mentioned
a
                     Metacentric height=I/∀ -BG
                     I=π*r⁴=π*3⁴
                     ∀=π*r*r*h=π*3*3*9
                     Metacentric height=0.325.
