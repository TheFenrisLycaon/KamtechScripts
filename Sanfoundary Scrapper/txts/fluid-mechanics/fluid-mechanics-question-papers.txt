1. Specific energy in GVF changes only under which of the following conditions.
a) Difference between bed slope and slope of energy line
b) Both bed slope and energy slope are equal
c) Presence of bed slope alone
d) Presence of energy slope alone
a
Hence if there’s a difference between bed slope and energy slope specific energy changes.
2. The channel is prismatic in case of a GVF.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Calculate the value of frictional slope for a rectangular channel having width 5m and depth 3m. Given:V=2 m/s and n = 0.012.
a) 2.01×10-4
b) 3.01×10-4
c) 4.01×10-4
d) 5.01×10-4
d
Friction slope is same as slope of energy line and the same equations are applicable.
