c) 0.15H
d) 0.25H
a
2. In Francis formula, the effective length is –
a) L-0.2H

d) L-0.1H
a
3. In Francis empirical expression for discharge, the relation between head of water and discharge is
a) Q is directly proportional to H
b) Q is directly proportional to H1.5
c) Q is directly proportional to H2.5
d) Q is directly proportional to H0.5
b
4. In Bazin’s formula, the discharge is inversely proportional to the length of weir.
a) True
b) False
b
5. The head of water over a rectangular weir is 38 cm. The length of the crest of the weir end contraction suppressed is 1.3 m. Find the discharge using the Francis formula.
a) 0.56 m3/s
b) 0.75 m3/s
c) 0.85 m3/s
d) 0.69 m3/s
a
6. The head of water over a rectangular weir is 28 cm. The length of the crest of the weir end contraction suppressed is 1.27 m. Find the discharge using the Francis formula.
a) 0.346 m3/s
b) 0.556 m3/s
c) 0.788 m3/s
d) 0.225 m3/s
a
                     m = ⅔ * Cd
                         = 0.405 + 0.003/H
                         = 0.405 + 0.003/0.28
                     Q = 0.346 m3/s.
7. The head of water over a rectangular weir is 26 cm. The length of the crest of the weir end contraction suppressed is 1.25 m. Find the discharge using the Francis formula.
a) 0.304 m3/s
b) 0.502 m3/s
c) 0.350 m3/s
d) 0.625 m3/s
a
                        = 0.304 m3/s.
8. The head of water over a rectangular weir is 28 cm. The length of the crest of the weir end contraction suppressed is 1.27 m. Find the discharge using the Francis formula.
a) 0.346 m3/s
b) 0.556 m3/s
c) 0.788 m3/s
d) 0.225 m3/s
a
                     m = ⅔ * Cd
                         = 0.405 + 0.003/H
                         = 0.405 + 0.003/0.28
                     Q = 0.346 m3/s.
9. Find the discharge over a cipolletti weir of length 1.5 m when the head over the weir is 0.85 m. Take Cd = 0.61.
a) 2.12 m3/s
b) 1.25 m3/s
c) 2.5 m3/s
d) 1.5 m3/s
a
                        = 2.12 m3/s.
10. Find the discharge over a cipolletti weir of length 1.3 m when the head over the weir is 0.65 m. Take Cd = 0.60.
a) 2.12 m3/s
b) 1.21 m3/s
c) 2.5 m3/s
d) 1.5 m3/s
b
                        = 1.21 m3/s.
