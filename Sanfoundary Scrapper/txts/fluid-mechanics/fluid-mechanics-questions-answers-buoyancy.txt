1. Find the position of centre of buoyancy for a wooden block of width 3.5 m and depth 1 m, when it floats horizontally in water. The density of wooden block id 850 kg/m3 and its length 7.0 m.
a) 0.95
b) 0.85
c) 1.05
d) 1.65
b
                     Volume of
 water displaced= Weight of water displaced/weight density of water
                                                              = 20.825 m3.
h=20.825/3.5*7=0.85 m.
2. A stone weighs 450 N in air and 200 N in water. Compute the volume of stone.
a) .025 m3
b) .05 m3
c) .075 m3
d) None of the mentioned
a
                                                             =250
Volume of water displaced=Volume of stone=250/9.81*1000=0.025 m3.
3. A stone weighs 650 N in air and 275 N in water. Compute its specific gravity.
a) 1.73
b) 2.45
c) 3.46
d) 0.865
a
                                                             =375
Volume of water displaced=Volume of stone=375/9.81*1000=0.038 m3
 Density of stone= mass/volume=650/9.81*0.038=1733 kg/m3
specific gravity= Density of stone/Density of water=1.73.
4. A body of dimensions 2.7 m * 3.8 m * 2.5 m, weighs 2500 N in water.Find its weight in air.
a) 254.12 kN
b) 508.25 kN
c) 101.65 kN
d) 127.06 kN
a
                                                       = 9.81*1000*2.7*3.8*2.5+2500=254.12 kN.
5. Find the density of metallic body which floats at the interface of mercury of sp.gr 13.6 and water such that 40 % of its volume is sub-merged in mercury and 60% in water.
a) 6040 kg/m3
b) 12080 kg/m3
c) 24160 kg/m3
d) 3020 kg/m3
a
                     For equilibrium, Total bouyant force= Weiht of body
        1000*9.81*0.6*V + 13.6*1000*9.81*0.4*V=ρ*g*V
         ρ=6040 kg/m3.
6. What is the principal cause of action of buoyant force on a body submerged partially or fully in fluid?
a) Displacement of fluid due to submerged body
b) Development of force due to dynamic action
c) Internal shear forces mitigating external forces
d) None of the mentioned
a
7. How can relatively denser object be made to float on the less dense fluid?
a) By altering the shape.
b) By altering the forces acting on the object
c) By altering the shear forces acting on the object
d) None of the mentioned
a
8. What happens to the buoyant force acting on the airship as it rises in the air?
a) Buoyant force increases
b) Buoyant force decreases
c) Buoyant force remains constant
d) Buoyant force first increases then shows decrease
b
9. As a balloon rises in the air its volume increases, at the end it acquires a stable height and cannot rise any further.
a) True
b) False
a
10. Submarines use principle of ‘neutral buoyancy’ to go into the water.
a) True
b) False
a
