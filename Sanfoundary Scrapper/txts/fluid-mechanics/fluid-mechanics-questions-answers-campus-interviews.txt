1. Find the discharge of water flowing over a rectangular notch of 1.5 m length when the constant head over the notch is 275 mm. Take Cd = .60
a) 400 lit/s
b) 465 lit/s
c) 385 lit/s
d) 575 lit/s
c
                       = .67 * 1.5 * √19.62 * .2751.5
                       = .385 m3/min.
2. The head of water over a rectangular notch is 900 mm. The discharge is 300 litres/s. Find the length of the notch, when CD =.62
a) .192 m
b) .250 m
c) .205 m
d) .175 m
a
                      = 1.5 * .3 / (.62 * √19.62 * .91.5)
                      = .192 m.
3. Find the discharge of water flowing over a rectangular notch of 1.3 m length when the constant head over the notch is 255 mm. Take Cd = .62
a) 400 lit/s
b) 465 lit/s
c) 385 lit/s
d) 575 lit/s
a
                       = .67 * 1.3 * √19.62 * .2551.5
                       = .385 m3/min.
4. The head of water over a rectangular notch is 700 mm. The discharge is 200 litres/s. Find the length of the notch, when CD =.63
a) .125 m
b) .265 m
c) .250 m
d) .200 m
a
                      = 1.5 * .2 / (.62 * √19.62 * .71.5)
                      = .125 m. 
5. Find the discharge over triangular notch of angle 50° when the head over the V notch
a) .93 m3/min
b) 1.45 m3/min
c) .88 m3/min
d) .90 m3/min
a
Here, x is the angle.
     = 8/15 * √19.62 * .221.5 * tan(50)
     = .93 m3/min.
6. The expression for discharge for a right angled notch is more complex than rectangular notch.
a) True
b) False
b
7. The results of which are more accurate; rectangular notch or triangular weir.
a) Rectangular notch
b) Triangular weir
c) Both are equally accurate
d) Rectangular weir
b
8. What is main reading required in calculation for rectangular notch or weir.
a) H
b) x, x is angle
c) L
d) None of the mentioned
a
9. We need to obligatorily have ventilation in triangular notch.
a) True
b) False
b
10. Rectangular notch may or may not have ventilation.
a) True
b) False
b
