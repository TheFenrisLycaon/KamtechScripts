1. Which one of the following is the correct relation between compressibility β and Bulk Modulus k
a) β = k
b) β = 1/k
c) β = 2k
d) β = k/2
b
2. Which one of the following is true about Bulk Modulus of elasticity?
a) it is the ratio of compressive stress to volumetric strain
b) it is the ratio of compressive stress to linear strain
c) it is the ratio of tensile stress to volumetric strain
d) it is the ratio of tensile stress to linear strain
a
3. The value of the Bulk Modulus of elasticity for an incompressible fluid is
a) zero
b) unity
c) infinity
d) very low
c
4. Three fluids 1, 2 and 3 have Bulk Moduli of k1, k2 and k3 respectively. If k1 > k2 > k3, which liquid will have the highest compressibility?
a) liquid 1
b) liquid 2
c) liquid 3
d) they’ll have equal compressibilities
c
5. Bulk Modulus, Pressure, Force, Stress – Which one of these won’t have the same unit as the others?
a) Bulk Modulus
b) Pressure
c) Force
d) Stress
c
6. Which of the following is the dimension of Bulk Modulus?
a) [M1L-1T-1].
b) [M1L-1T-2].
c) [M1L1T-2].
d) [M1L1T-1].
b
7. Which one of the following is the unit of compressibility?
a) m=N
b) m2=N
c) m3=N
d) it is unitless
b
Thus the unit of Bulk modulus is N/m2 and the unit of compressibility becomes m2/N.
8. Which of the following is the dimension of compressibility?
a) [M1L1T-2].
b) [M1L1T-1].
c) [M-1L1T-2].
d) [M-1L1T2].
d
and [β] = [1/k] = [M-1L1T2].
