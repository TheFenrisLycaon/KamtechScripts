1. The continuity equation is based on the premise of-
a) Law of conservation of energy
b) Law of conservation of mass
c) Law of conservation of momentum
d) None of the mentioned
b
2. The continuity equation is only applicable to incompressible fluid.
a) True
b) False
b
3. For incompressible fluid flow, if area reduces then what is the effect on the velocity.
a) increases
b) decreases
c) first increases then decreases
d) first  decreases then increases
a
Area × velocity = constant
Hence, as area decreases velocity increases.
4. For compressible fluid flow in a pipe, having decrease in specific gravity what will be the effect of decrease in diameter?
a) It will cause increase in velocity
b) It will cause decrease in velocity
c) It remains constant
d) None of the mentioned
a
ρ*A*v = constant
Hence, as density and area decreases velocity is bound to increase.
5. What is the most common assumption while dealing with fluid flow problems using continuity equation?
a) Flow is assumed to be compressible
b) Flow is assumed to be unsteady
c) Flow is assumed to be steady
d) Flow is assumed to be turbulent
c

6. The diameters of a pipe at the sections 1 and 2 are 8 cm and 13 cm respectively. Find the discharge through pipe if the velocity of water flowing through the pipe at section 1 is 6 m/s. Determine also the velocity at section 2.
a) 2.27 m/s
b) 4.54 m/s
c) 1.13 m/s
d) 3.25 m/s
a
                         Area × velocity = constant
                         Area1*Velocity1 = Area2*Velocity2
                         Velocity2=(Area1*Velocity1)/Area2
                                       = (82 * 6) / 132=2.27 m/s. 
7. The continuity equation can only be used for analysis of conserved quantity.
a) True
b) False
a
8. The diameter of a pipe at the section 1 is 9 cm. If the velocity of water flowing through the pipe at section 1 is 4.8 m/s and section 2 is 9 m/s, Determine the area at section 2.
a) 33.93 m2
b) 67.86 m2
c) 16.96 m2
d) 38.66 m2
a
                         Area × velocity = constant
                         Area1*Velocity1 = Area2*Velocity2
                        (Area1*Velocity1)/Velocity2=Area2
                                       Area 2= 33.93 m2.
9. For a flow to be physically possible it must primarily satisfy which equation?

b) Equation of conservation of mass or continuity equation
c) Equation of conservation of momentum
d) None of the mentioned
a
10. Continuity equation can also be derived for polar coordinate system
a) True
b) False
