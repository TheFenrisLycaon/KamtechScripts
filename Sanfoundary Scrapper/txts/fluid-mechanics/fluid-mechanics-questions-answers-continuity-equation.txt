d
2ax + cx + by + 2dy = 0
(2a + c)x + (b + 2d)y = 0.
11. In a two dimensional flow, the component of the velocity along the X-axis and the Y-axis are u = ax2 + bxy and v = bxy + ay2. The condition for the flow field to be continuous is
a) independent of the constants (a; b) but dependent on the variables (x; y)
b) independent of the variables (x; y) but dependent on the constants (a; b)
c) independent of both the constants (a; b) and the variables (x; y)
d) dependent on both the constants (a; b) and the variables (x; y)
a
2ax + by + 2ay + bx = 0
x + y = 0
Hence, the condition for the flow field to be continuous is independent of the constants (a; b) and dependent only on the variables (x; y).
12. In a two dimensional flow, the component of the velocity along the X-axis and the Y-axis are u = ax + by and v = ax – by. For what condition will the flow field be continuous?
a) impossible
b) possible if a = b
c) possible if a = 2b
d) possible for all values of a and b

Thus, the condition will be satisfied for any and every value of a and b.
13. In a two dimensional flow, the component of the velocity along the X-axis and the Y-axis are u = ay2 + bxy and v = ax2 + bxy. The flow will be continuous if
a) a + b = 0
b) a – b = 0
c) x + y = 0
d) x – y = 0

x + y = 0.
14. In a two dimensional flow, the component of the velocity along the X-axis and the Y-axis are u = ax2 + bxy and v = bxy + ay2. The condition for the flow field to be continuous is
a) independent of a and b
b) independent of a and c
c) independent of b and c
d) independent of a, b and c
d
2ax + by + 2ay + bx = 0
x + y = 0
Hence, the condition for the flow field to be continuous is independent of a, b and c.
15. In a water supply system, water flows in from pipes 1 and 2 and goes out from pipes 3 and 4 as shown. If all the pipes have the same diameter, which of the following must be correct?
a) the sum of the flow velocities in 1 and 2 is equal to that in 3 and 4
b) the sum of the flow velocities in 1 and 3 is equal to that in 2 and 4
c) the sum of the flow velocities in 1 and 4 is equal to that in 2 and 3
d) the flow velocities in 1 and 2 is equal to that in 3 and 4
a
where a represents flow area, v represents flow velocity, i is for inlet conditions and o is for outlet conditions.
A1v1 + A2v2 = A3v3 + A4v4
Since d1 = d2 = d3 = d4, v1 + v2 = v3 + v4.
