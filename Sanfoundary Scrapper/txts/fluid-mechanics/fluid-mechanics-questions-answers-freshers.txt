d) None of the mentioned
a
                                     =  force* radius* angular velocity
                                     =  shear stress * area* radius* angular velocity
                     Shear Stress = viscosity* velocity gradient

a
                                                    = (shear stress*density)/velocity gradient
                                                    = (4904* 1962)/(20*0.2)

a
                     viscosity= shear stress/velocity gradient
                     shear stress = 0.86*0.2 = 0.172N/m2.
