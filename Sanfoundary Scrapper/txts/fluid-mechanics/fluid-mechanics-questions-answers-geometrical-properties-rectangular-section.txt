d) 18.6m2
d
9. Calculate the wetted perimeter for a rectangular channel having top width of 4.5m and depth of 3m.
a) 12m
b) 10.5m
c) 7.5m
d) 15m
b
= 4.5 + 2(3)
= 10.5m. 
10. A rectangular channel has a depth of 5m and width of 12m. Calculate the hydraulic depth of the channel.
a) 5m
b) 6m
c) 7m
d) 8m
a
= (5) (12)/ 12
= 5m.
11. The depth and widths of a rectangular channel are 4m and 5m respectively. Determine the hydraulic radius of the channel.
a) 4.22m
b) 3.54m
c) 2.22m
d) 1.54m
d
= (4) (5)/(5 + 2(4))
= 1.54m.
12. Determine the section factor for the channel section having area 20m2.
a) 20m
b) 30m
c) 40m
d) 50m
b
= 20√4
= 40m. 
13. The section factor and hydraulic depth for a rectangular channel are 40m and 4m respectively. Determine the top width of the channel.
a) 3m
b) 4m
c) 5m
d) 6m
c
40 = A√4 ; A = 20m2
A = (Depth) (Width)
Width = 5m. 
14. The hydraulic depth of a rectangular channel is 2m and its wetted area is 12m2. Estimate its hydraulic radius.
a) 1.2m
b) 1.3m
c) 1.4m
d) 1.5m
a
2 = 12/ T
T = 6m
Hydraulic Radius (R) = A/P
P = T+ 2(D)
P = 6+ 2(2) = 10m
R = 12/ 10 = 1.2m.  
15. Let the top width of a rectangular channel be B and the depth be y, determine the hydraulic radius of the channel.
a) By/ B+2y
b) By/ B+ y
c) y
d) B
