10. The product Zy in a Trapezoidal channel is 2 and the side slope is1/2. Calculate the wetted perimeter of the channel section if the wetted is 32m2.
a) 13.94m
b) 14.94m
c) 15.94m
d) 16.94m
b
A = (B+Zy)y;B=6m
Wetted Perimeter = B+2y√(1+Z2)
P = 14.94m. 
11. The top width of a trapezoidal channel is 12m, the bottom width of the channel is 6m and the side slope is 1H:2V, calculate the wetted perimeter.
a) 17.41m
b) 18.41m
c) 19.41m
d) 20.41m
c
12 = 6 +2(1/2)(y); y=6m
P = B+2y√(1+Z2)
P = 19.41m. 
12. The wetted area of a trapezoidal section is 15m^2 and the top width is 6m, calculate the section factor.
a) 23.72
b) 24.72
c) 25.72
