1. What is the wetted area for a triangular channel having depth y and the side slope being Z?
a) Zy2
b) 2Zy
c) Zy
d) Z2 y
a
The Area of the Triangle = (½) (base) (height)
Base = Zy+Zy = 2Zy
Area = (1/2) (2Zy) (y)
Area = Zy2.
2. Calculate the wetted perimeter of a triangular section having depth y and the side slope is Z.
d
3. Calculate the wetted perimeter of a triangular section having a depth of 4m and the side slope is1H:1V.
a) 7.94m
b) 8.94m
c) 9.94m
d) 10.94m
b
4. Estimate the wetted area of a triangular channel having a depth of 5m and the side slope is 2H:1V.
a) 50m2
b) 60m2
c) 70m2
d) 80m2
a
= 2(52)
= 50m2. 
5. What is the top width of a triangular channel having a depth y and side slope Z?
a) Zy
b) Zy2
c) 2Zy
d) ½Zy
c
= 2Zy. 
6. Determine the hydraulic depth of a triangular channel having the side slope Z and depth y.
a) y
b) y/2
c) 2y
d) y2
b
7. Estimate the top width of a triangular channel having a side slope of 1H:2V and depth of 5m.
a) 4m
b) 5m
c) 6m
d) 7m
b
Top Width = (2)(1/2)(5)
Top Width = 5m. 
8. What is the Hydraulic Radius of a triangular channel having a depth y and side slope Z?
c
9. What is the section factor for a triangular channel having depth y and side slope Z?
c
10. Calculate the section factor a triangular channel section having side slope 1H:4V and depth of 8m.
a) 32
b) 34
c) 36
d) 38
