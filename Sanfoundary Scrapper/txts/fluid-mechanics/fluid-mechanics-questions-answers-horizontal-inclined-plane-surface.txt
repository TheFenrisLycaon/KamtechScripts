a
5. A circular plate 5.0 m diameter is immersed in such a way that its greatest and least depth below the free surface are 3 m and 1 m respectively. determine the position of the centre of pressure.
a) 2.5 m
b) 5 m
c) 4.5 m
d) 6 m
a
                                                                                        …….ĥ=(y+dsinθ)

=2.5 m.
6. For an inclined plate the pressure intensity at every point differs.
a) True
b) False
a
7. The pressure intensity for a horizontal plate is maximum on the surface of the earth and decreases as we move further away from the surface of the earth either downward or upward.
a) True
b) False
a
8. For an inclined plane for which position, maximum total pressure acts on it.
a) Horizontal
b) Vertical
c) Inclined
d) None of the mentioned
b
For vertical plate, θ=90⁰
Hence, total pressure is maximum.
9. The total pressure or pressure intensity is zero for any point on inclined surface in space.
a) True
b) False
a
In space, w=0 as g=0
Hence, f=0.
