a) 1.33
b) 1.57
c) 2.17
d) 2.33
c
where I= the moment of inertia and A = area and θ = the angle of inclination of the lamina to the horizontal. Now,

14. The upper and lower edges of a square lamina of length 4 m are at a depths of 1 m and 3 m respectively in water. What will be the total pressure (in kN) on the lamina?
a) 156.96
b) 235.44
c) 313.92
d) 392.4
c
Total liquid pressure on the lamina = F = γyA, where γ = specific weight of the liquid, y = depth of centroid of the lamina from the free surface, A= area of the centroid. Now, γ = 9:81 * 0.9 * 103 N / m3; y = 1 + 3-1 / 2 = 2m, A = 4 * 4 = 16 m2. Hence, F = 313.92 kN.
