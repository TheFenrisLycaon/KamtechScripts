6. What type of indicator device is used nowadays?
a) Digital pressure indicator
b) Mechanical indicator
c) Electrical indicator
d) Ionization Gauge

7. How can we asses the indicator diagram by looking at the card diagram?
a) Comparing the maximum firing pressure and compression pressure
b) Dead weight method
c) Conveyor method
d) Ionization method
a
8. Which among the following is not an effect of deficiency in the indicator diagram?
a) Bad quality of fuel
b) Fuel pump leakage
c) Low fuel pressure
d) Fuel temperature rise
d
9. Deficiency type 3 is not caused due to_________
a) Leaking exhaust valve
b) Resistance to flow of air
c) Low scavenging pressure
d) High linear wear
b
10. Deficiency type 4 is caused due to_________
a) Resistance to flow of air
b) Leaking exhaust valve
c) Low scavenging pressure
d) Overload of engine
d
Explanation Deficiencies in an indicator diagram are classified into many types. Deficiencies can be determined using the card diagram. Card diagram contains maximum firing pressure and compression pressure. In deficiency 4, compression pressure is high and peak pressure is also high leading to the overload of an engine.
