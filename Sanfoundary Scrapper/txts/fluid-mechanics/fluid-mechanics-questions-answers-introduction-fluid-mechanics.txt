1. Which one is in a state of failure?
a) Solid
b) Liquid
c) Gas
d) Fluid
d
2. A small shear force is applied on an element and then removed. If the element regains it’s original position, what kind of an element can it be?
a) Solid
b) Liquid
c) Fluid
d) Gaseous
a
3. In which type of matter, one won’t find a free surface?
a) Solid
b) Liquid
c) Gas
d) Fluid
c
4. If a person studies about a fluid which is at rest, what will you call his domain of study?
a) Fluid Mechanics
b) Fluid Statics
c) Fluid Kinematics
d) Fluid Dynamics
b
5. The value of the compressibility of an ideal fluid is
a) zero
b) unity
c) infinity
d) more than that of a real fluid
a
6. The value of the Bulk Modulus of an ideal fluid is
a) zero
b) unity
c) infinity
d) less than that of a real fluid
c
k = 1⁄fi
Ideal fluids are incompressible which means fi = 0. Thus, k will be infinity.
7. The value of the viscosity of an ideal fluid is
a) zero
b) unity
c) infinity
d) more than that of a real fluid
a
8. The value of the surface tension of an ideal fluid is
a) zero
b) unity
c) infinity
d) more than that of a real fluid
a
