4. In a U-tube manometer, one end is open to the atmosphere, the other end attached to a pressurized gas of gauge pressure 40 kPa. The height of the fluid column in the atmospheric side is 60 cm, and that on the gas side is 30 cm. The manometic fluid used is: (Take g = 9.8 m/s2).
a) Water
b) Liquid ammonia
c) Oil
d) Mercury

c
10. In the manometer given above, 2 immiscible fluids mercury (ρ = 13600 kg/m3) and water (ρ = 1000 kg/m3) are used as manometric fluids. The water end is exposed to atmosphere (100 kPa) and the mercury end is exposed to a gas. At this position, the interface between the fluids is at the bottom most point of the manometer. Ignore the width of the manometer tube and the radius of curvature. The value of h is found to be 9.45 m. The height of the mercury column is given to be 75 cm. Find the gauge pressure of the gas.
