h= d+(L/2)tanθ
  = 2.5+3.5tan24.64
  = 4.1 m
F=wAĥ
  =9810*2.68*4.1
  = 1.07 MN.
5. A tank containing water upto a depth of 500 mm is moving vertically upward with a constant acceleration of 2.45 m/s2. Find the force exerted by fluid of specific gravity .65 on the side of tank,width of tank is 1m.
a) 996.1 N
b) 1992.2 N
c) 498.06 N
d) 124.5 N
a
                       =650*9.81*0.5*(1+2.45/9.81)
                       =3984.5 N/m2
                      F=wAĥ
                        = 650*9.81*0.5*0.5*3984.5
                        = 996.1N.
6. A tank containing water upto a depth of 750 mm is moving vertically downward with a constant acceleration of 3.45 m/s2. Find the force exerted by fluid of specific gravity .85 on the side of tank,width of tank is 2m
a) 2682.75 N
b) 5365.5 N
c) 1341.25 N
d) 4024.5 N
a
                       =750*9.81*0.75*(1-3.45/9.81)
                       =3577 N/m2
                      F=wAĥ
                        = 0.5*0.75*3984.5*2
                        = 2682.75 N.
7. A tank containing water upto a depth of 650 mm is stationary. Find the force exerted by fluid of specific gravity .55 on the side of tank,width of tank is 1.5m
a) 1709.9 N
b) 3419.4N
c) 6838.8 N
d) 1367.75 N
a
                       =550*9.81*0.65
