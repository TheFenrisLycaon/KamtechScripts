1. The right limb of a simple U-tube manometer containing mercury is open to the atmosphere while the lift limb is connected to a pipe in which a fluid of specific gravity 0.85 is flowing. The centre of the pipe is 14 cm below the level of mercury in the right limb.Evaluate the pressure of fluid flowing in the pipe if the difference of mercury level in the two limbs is 22 cm.
a) 2.86 N/cm2
b) 5.73 N/cm2
c) 1.43 N/cm2
d) None of the mentioned
a
P = 13600×9.81×0.22 – 850×9.81×.08
   =  2.86 N/cm2.
2. A single coloumn manometer is connected to a pipe containing a liquid of specific gravity 0.75. Find the pressure in the pipe if the area of reservoir is 250 times the area of tube for the manometer reading. The difference in mercury level is 40 cm. On the left limb the fluid is upto the height of 20 cm.
a) 10.42 N/cm2
b) 5.21 N/cm2
c) 2.60 N/cm2
d) None of the mentioned
b
                                 = 5.21 N/cm2
{ Here a/A = 1/ 250}.
3. A Differential manometer is connected at the points A and Bat the centre of two pipes. The pipe A(left limb) contains a liquid of specific gravity = 1.5 while pipe B (right limb)contains a liquid of specific gravity 0.85. The pressure at A and B are .5  kgf/cm2 and 1.2 kgf/cm2 respectively. Find the difference in level of mercuru in the differential manometer. A is 2.5m above B and 5 m above the mercury in its own limb. B is 2.5 m above the mercury level in limb A.
a) 12.7 cm
b) 25.5 cm
c) 6.28 cm
d) 10.85 cm
a
                  	0.5*9.81*10000 + 5*9.81*1500 + h*9.81*13600 = 1.2*9.81*10000 + (h+2)*9.81*850
                 	 After solving,
                 	h=12.7 cm.
4. An inverted differential manometer is connected to two pipes A and B which covey water. The fluid in manometer is oil of specific gravity 0.75. For the manometer readings, find the pressure difference between A and B. Datum in left limb is 40 cm above point A. Point B is 60 cm below datum line. Difference in level of fluid is 20 cm.
a) 1471 N/m2
b) 2943 N/m2
c) 735.75 N/m2
d) None of the mentioned
a
                	Pressure difference between A and B = -0.4*9.81*100 + 0.2*9.81*750 +                 0.4*9.81*1000
                                                                                        = 1471 N/m2.
