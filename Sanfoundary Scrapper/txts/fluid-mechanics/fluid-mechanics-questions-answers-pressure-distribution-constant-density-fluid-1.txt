c

Thus, 
3. Which one of the following statements is true regarding pressure?
a) Pressure is a scalar quantity
b) Pressure is a vector quantity
c) Pressure is a scalar quantity only when the area is infinitesimally small
d) Pressure is a vector quantity only when the area is infinitesimally small
a
4. A beaker half-filled with water is exposed to the atmosphere. If the pressure at points A, B and C as shown are Pa, Pb and Pc respectively, which one of the following will be the relation connecting the three?
a) Pa > Pb = Pc
b) Pa > Pb > Pc
c) Pa < Pb < Pc
d) Pa < Pb = Pc
d
Pressure remains constant in the horizontal direction, Pb = Pc. Therefore, Pa < Pb = Pc.
5. A beaker is filled with a liquid up to a height h. If A and B are two points, one on the free surface and one at the base as shown, such that the minimum distance between the two is l, what will be the pressure at point B?
b
PB = PA + ρgh
where PB=Pressure at B, PA=Pressure at A, ρ=density of the liquid, g=acceleration due to gravity and h=vertical distance sePArating the two points. Since A is at the free surface, PA = 0, PB = ρgh.
6. A beaker of height h is filled with a liquid of density ρ up to a certain limit. The beaker is rotated by an angle θ such that further increase in the angle will result in over flow of the liquid. If the liquid surface is exposed to the atmosphere, what will be the gauge pressure at point B?
a) ρgh
b) ρgh sin θ
c) ρgh cos θ
d) ρgh=2
c
Since the pressure at the free surface is atmospheric, the gauge pressure at B will be = 0 + ρgh cos θ.
7. An arm of a teapot is completely filled with tea (density=ρ) If the arm has a length of l and is inclined at 30o to the horizontal, what will be the pressure difference between the two points, C at the mouth and D at the base of the arm?
a) ρgl
b) ρgl/2
c) √2ρgl
d) 2ρgl
b
8. A beaker is filled with a liquid of density ρ1 up to a certain height. The pressure at the base of the beaker id Pb. If the liquid is replaced by an equal volume of another liquid of density ρ2, what will be the pressure at the base of the beaker now?
d
9. A beaker is filled with a liquid of density ρ1 up to a certain height. A is a point, h m downwards from the free surface of the liquid as shown. The liquid is replaced by equal volume of another liquid of density ρ2. If ρ1 > ρ2, how will the pressure at point A change?
a) remain same
b) increase
c) decrease
d) become zero
c
10. A beaker is filled with a liquid of density ρ1 up to a certain height. A is a point, h m downwards from the free surface such that the pressure at A is P. If the liquid is replaced by equal volume of another liquid of density ρ2, at what distance from the free surface will the pressure be P now?
c
11. If the pressure at a point is 1m of water, what will be it’s value in terms of m of oil? (Take, the specific gravity of oil to be 0.8)
a) 0.8
b) 1
c) 1.25
d) 2.5
c
Thus, h = ρwater / ρoil = 1/0.8 = 1.25.
12. A beaker is filled with a liquid of density ρ up to a height h. If half the liquid is replaced by equal volume of another liquid of twice the density, what will be the change in the base pressure?
a) increased by ρgh
b) decreased by ρgh
c) increased by ρgh=2
d) decreased by ρgh=2
c
Base pressure when half the liquid is replaced by equal volume of another liquid of twice the density
= ρg h⁄2 + 2ρg h⁄2 = 3⁄2 ρgh
Thus the change in base pressure is = ρgh / 2.  Since, P2 > P1, there will be an increase in pressure.
13. A cuboidal container (each side of 30 cm0) is completely filled with water. A is a point, 25 cm above the base such that the pressure at point A is P. At what height (in cm) from the base will the pressure be 2P?
a) 20
b) 15
c) 12.5
d) 10
a
14. A closed tank (of height 5 m) is PArtially filled with a liquid as shown. If the pressure of the air above the fluid is 2 bar, find the pressure at the bottom of the tank. Assume the density of the liquid to vary according to the following relation:
where y is the height from the base
a) 2.12
b) 2.15
c) 2.18
d) 2.5
c
15. The pressure gauges 1, 2 and 3 are installed on the system as shown. If the readings of the gauges be P1 = 1 bar, P2 = 2bar and P3 = 3 bar, what will be the value of P? (Take Patm = 1.01 bar)
a) 3.01
b) 4.01
c) 6.01
d) 7.01
d
PB = PA + P2
PC = PB + P3
P = PC = PAtm + P1 + P2 + P3 = 1.01 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 7.01.
