1. If the atmospheric pressure at sea level is 7.5 N/cm2, determine the pressure at a height of 3000m assuming the pressure variation follows isothermal law. The density of air is given as 1.2 km/m3.
a) 4.68 N/cm2
b) 9.37 N/cm2
c) 2.34 N/cm2
d) None of the mentioned
a
                                                             =75000*e  -9.81*3000*1.2/75000 
= 4.68 N/cm2.
2. The barometric pressure at sea level is 760 mm of Mercury while that on a mountain top is 715 mm. If the density of air is assumed constant at 1.2 kg/m3 , what is the elevation of the mountain top?
a) 510 m
b) 1020 m
c) 255 m
d) 128 m
a
                                                                        h=(9.81*13600*0.76)-9.81*13600*0.715)/1.2*9.81
  =510 m. 
3. Calculate the pressure at a height of 6500m above the sea level if the atmospheric pressure is 10.145 N/cm2 and temperature is 25℃ assuming air is incompressible. Take density of air as 1.2 kg/m3. Neglect variation of g.
a) 4.98 N/cm2
b) 2.49 N/cm2
c) 1.24 N/cm2
d) None of the mentioned
b
                                    =101450-9.81*1.2*6500
                                    = 2.49 N/cm2.
4. Calculate the pressure of air at a height of 3500m from sea level where pressure and temperature of air are 10 N/cm2 and 25℃ respectively. The temperature lapse rate is given as 0.0065 ℃ /m. Take density of air at sea level equal to 1.2 kg/m3.
a) 19.7 N/cm2
b) 9.85 N/cm2
c) 4.93 N/cm2
d) 6.24 N/cm2
b
                                   =9.85 N/cm2
Here, Lapse rate= -g/R*(k/k-1).
