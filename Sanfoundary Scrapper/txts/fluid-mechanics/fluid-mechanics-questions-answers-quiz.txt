6. What is the variation of total pressure with depth for any submerged surface if we neglect variation in the density?
a) Linear
b) Parabolic
c) Curvilinear
d) Logarithmic
a
                     F=w*a*y
                     hence, F ∝ y i.e linear relation.
7. A pipe line which is 6 m  in diameter contains a gate valve. The pressure at the centre of the pipe is 25 N/cm2. If the pipe is filled with specific gravity 0.8, find the force exerted by the oil upon the gate.
a) 7.06 MN
b) 14.12 MN
c) 3.53 MN
d) 28.24 MN
a
                       =250000/9.81*800
                       =31.855 m
                    F=wAĥ
                      =9.81*800*9*π*31.855
                       =7.06 MN.
8. Determine the centre of pressure on an isosceles triangle plate of base 6m and altitude 6m when it is immersed vertically in an oil of specific gravity 0.75. The base of the plate coincides with the free surface of oil.
a) 6 m
b) 3 m
c) 9 m
d) 12 m
b
                       I=bh³/36
                      ŷ=36*2/18 + 2
                        =3 m.
9. A tank contains water upto a height of 0.5 m above the base. An immiscible liquid of specific gravity 0.75 is filled on the top of water upto 1.5 m height. Calculate total pressure on side of the tank.
a) 17780.61 N/m2
b) 35561.22 N/m2
c) 71122.44 N/m2
d) 8890.31 N/m2
a
                     F=w*A*ŷ
                     F= 8277.18+5518.12+3985.31
                       = 17780.61 N/m2.
10. A circular opening, 6m diameter, in a vertical side of a tank is closed by a disc of 6m diameter which can rotate about a horizontal diameter. Calculate the force on the disc. The centre of circular opening is at the depth of 5 m.
a) 1.38 MN
b) 2.76 MN
c) 5.54 MN
d) 7.85 MN
a
                       =9.81*1000*3.142*32*5
                       =1.38 MN.
