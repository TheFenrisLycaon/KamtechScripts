where I= the moment of inertia and A = area and θ = the angle of inclination of the lamina to the horizontal. Now,
y = 1 + 3 – 1 / 2 = 2, I = π ⁄ 64 * 42 = 4π,  A = π ⁄ 4 * 42 = 4π, sin θ = 1 ⁄ 2 Thus, yCP = 2.125m.

where m = mass of the plate, θ = angle of inclination to the horizontal, Fhyd = hydrostatic force on
the plate, x = distance of the point of action of Fhyd from the hinge point = 2⁄3 * 5 = 10⁄3
Fhyd = γyA, where γ = specific weight of the liquid = 9.81 * 103 y = depth of the centre of pressure from the free surface = 2.5/2 = 1.25 and A = 5 * 1. Substituting all the values in the equation, we get m = 9622.5g.
