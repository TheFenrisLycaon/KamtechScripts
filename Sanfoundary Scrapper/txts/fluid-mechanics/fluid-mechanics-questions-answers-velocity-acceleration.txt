a) 40 m/s2
b) 20 m/s2
c) 60 m/s2
d) 80 m/s2
a
on putting the coordinates, the acceleration obtained is 40 m/s2.
2. Determine the third velocity component such that continuity equation is satisfied if two components are u=2y2, w=2xyz.
a) -2xy+x2y+f(y,z)
b) 4xy-x2y+f(y,z)
c) -4xy-x2y+f(y,z)
d) -2xy-x2y+f(y,z)
c
Here du/dx=0 and w=2xy.
On solving by integrating, we get v = -4xy-x2y+f(y,z).
3. Determine the third velocity component such that continuity equation is satisfied if two components are u=x2+y2+z2, v=xy2 – yz2 + xy
a) -3xz-2xyz+z2/3+f(y,z)
b) -3xz+2xyz+z3/3+f(y,z)
c) -3xz-2xyz+z3/3+f(x,z)
d) -3xz-2xyz+z3/3+f(y,z)
d
Here du/dx=2x and v=2xy-z2
On solving by integrating, we get w = -3xz-2xyz+z3/3+f(y,z),
