a) 0
b) 0.5
c) 1
d) 2
c
4. Which of the following correctly states how the viscosities of a liquid and a gas will change with temperature?
a) Viscosity increases with the increase in temperature of a liquid and decreases with the increase in temperature of a gas
b) Viscosity increases with the increase in temperature of a liquid and increases with the increase in temperature of a gas

5. Which one of the following is not a unit of dynamic viscosity?
a) Pa-s
b) N-s/m2
c) Poise
d) Stokes
d
where F= viscous force, A= area, du ⁄ dx = velocity gradient, μ = co-effcient of viscosity. Therefore,
SI unit of μ is N-s/m2 = Pa-s and CGS unit of μ is dyne-s/cm2. 1 Poise= 1 dyne-s/cm2 and 1 Stokes= 1 cm2/s. Thus, Stokes is not an unit of μ, rather it is a unit of kinematic viscosity υ.
6. Which of the following is a unit of dynamic viscosity?
a) [M1 L1 T-1].
b) [M1 L-1 T-1].
c) [M1 L-2 T-2].
d) [M1 L-2 T-2].
b
where F= viscous force, A= area, du ⁄ dx = velocity gradient, μ = co-effcient of viscosity. Therefore,
7. Which one of the following is the CGS unit of dynamic viscosity?
a) Stokes
b) Pa-s
c) m2/s
d) Poise
d
where F= viscous force, A= area, du ⁄ dx = velocity gradient, μ = co-effcient of viscosity. Therefore,
CGS unit of μ is = dyne-s/cm2. 1 Poise= 1 dyne-s/cm2 and 1 Stokes= 1 cm2/s. Thus, the CGS unit of μ will be Poise. Stokes is the CGS unit of kinematic viscosity.
8. The dynamic viscosity of a fluid is 1 Poise. What should one multiply to it to get the answer in N-s/m2?

9. Which of the following is a unit of kinematic viscosity?
a) Stokes
b) Pa-s
c) m2=s
d) Poise
a
Thus, the unit of ν is cm2/s = Stokes Poise is the unit of dynamic viscosity.
1 Poise = 1 dyne-s/cm2 
10. Which of the following is the dimension of kinematic viscosity?
a) [L1 T-1].
b) [L1 T-2].
c) [L2 T-1].
d) [L2 T-2].
c
11. The kinematic viscosity of a fluid is 0.1 Stokes. What will be the value is m2/s?
a) 10-2
b) 10-3
c) 10-4
d) 10-5

12. The shear stress at a point in a liquid is found to be 0.03 N/m2. The velocity gradient at the point is 0.15 s-1. What will be it’s viscosity (in Poise)?
a) 20
b) 2
c) 0.2
d) 0.5
b
where F= viscous force, A= area, du ⁄ dx = velocity gradient, μ = co-effcient of viscosity. Therefore,
13. The space between two plates (20cm*20cm*1cm), 1 cm apart, is filled with a liquid of viscosity 1 Poise. The upper plate is dragged to the right with a force of 5N keeping the lower plate stationary.
What will be the velocity in m/s of flow at a point 0.5 cm below the lower surface of the upper plate if linear velocity profile is assumed for the flow?
a) 1.25
b) 2.5
c) 12.5
d) 0.25
c
where Fν = viscous force, A = area, du ⁄ dx = velocity gradient, μ = co-effcient of viscosity. If linear velocity profile is assumed, du⁄dx = U/x, where U = velocity of the upper plate and x = distance between the two plates. Now, the viscous force Fv = -F= -5N. Substituting all the values in the equation, U becomes 12.5 m/s.
