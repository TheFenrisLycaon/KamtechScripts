6. Statement 1: When there is an equilibrium between the vapor pressure and the percentage relative humidity, water activity is directly proportional to the percentage relative humidity.

b) Interaction with solute may break or increase the water structures
c) None of the mentioned
d) Neither of the mentioned
b
8. Statement 1: Sodium chloride has a higher water activity than sucrose.

a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
b
9. Statement 1: Just like the vapor pressure on an individual component is higher than when it is in bulk, the water activity is low when in bulk.
Statement 2: Water activity is directly proportional to the surface tension and molecular weight of water and inversely proportional to density of water.

10. If a dehydrated porous absorptive food is soaked in a solution whose viscosity is not too high to penetrate, then the food will absorb an amount of solution approximately equal to the amount of water it would normally absorb.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Semi moist food items work on the principle that the additives will diffuse into the food to an extent that the final concentration in the food and in the solution will be similar.
a) True
b) False
a
12. Semi moist food items work on the principle of equilibrium, that is at a dry state, the food items absorb the solution and in the wet state, water is washed out with another liquid by diffusion.
a) True
b) False
