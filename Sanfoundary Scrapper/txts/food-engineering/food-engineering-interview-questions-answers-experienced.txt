1. According to Nusselt’s film theory, the film thickness decreases as we move from bottom to top. The heat transfer increases.
a) True
b) False
b
2. Statement 1: Unsteady state heat transfer equation can be used when there is negligible internal resistance.
Statement 2: Unsteady state heat transfer equation can be used for liquid food items which are well stirred, because, temperature gradient within won’t be there.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
b
3. Statement 1: In nusselt’s film theory, velocity of the falling film is not affected by the velocity of the vapors.
Statement 2: LMTD can be used provided the overall heat transfer co-efficient is constant over a large range of temperatures.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
b
4. Find heat transfer in an agitated jacketed vessel if NRei is 1.5 * 105 and NPr is 20.
a) 0.9
b) 1.2
c) 1.8
d) None of the mentioned
a
Substituting values, we get 0.9.
фv is neglected.
5. Which of the following is NOT a real dimensionless number?
a) Pectit number
b) Stanton number
c) Graetz number
d) Grashof number
a
6. Statement 1: NPr= (Cpm)/kl
Statement 2: Stanton number is a product of NRe and NPr.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
c
Pecklet number is a product of NRe and NPr.
7. Statement 1: G is known as the mass flux and it is the product of density and velocity.
Statement 2: Grashof number is associated with forced convection.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
a
8. Фv is generally taken as 1 in food processing as generally very high wall temperatures aren’t reached and hence (µ/µw) * 0.14 is 1 as there isn’t much difference in µ and µw.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Statement 1: Sieder-Tate and Dittus-boelter equations imply only to laminar flow conditions.
Statement 2: Under laminar conditions, the same equation applies both to Newtonian and Non-Newtonian fluids.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
c
10. Dittus-boelter equation is applicable for fluids with phase change.
a) True
b) False
b
