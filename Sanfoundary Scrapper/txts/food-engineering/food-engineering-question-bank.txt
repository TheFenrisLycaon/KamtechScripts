4. Statement 1: In a dairy industry, it is desired to obtain the cream from milk using a centrifuge. Which will stay in the center?
Statement 2: It is desired to have __________ for the above process.
a) Cream, a small neutral zone
b) Milk, a small neutral zone
c) Milk, a large neutral zone
d) Cream, a large neutral zone
a
It is desired to have a small neutral zone so as to have a larger central zone where the cream gets accumulated.
