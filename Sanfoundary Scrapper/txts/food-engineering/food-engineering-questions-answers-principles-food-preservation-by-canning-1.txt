a) Keeping the time constant from previous calculations and maintaining a certain temperature
b) Bringing the temperature down to a certain value such that the bacteria die in 10 minutes
c) Keeping the temperature constant and keeping them at that temperature till the time they die

10. Statement 1: Heat resistance of an organism is designated by the ‘c’ value.
Statement 2: The ‘z’ value stands for the number of degrees centigrade required for the thermal death time curve to traverse one logarithmic cycle.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
b
11. There is an existing relationship between the heat resistance of a vegetative cell and that of the spore formed thereafter.
a) True
b) False
b
12. 
The x-axis shows the temperature and the y-axis shows the killing time. This is with respect to spores in a suspension. Curve a = 100,000 spores/ml and b= 1,000 spores/ml. Above curve a is the region of spores killed and below the region b is the region of spores survived. Which of the following do we comprehend from the above?
a) Greater the spore concentration, more heat resistant the suspension
b) Spores of a given strain, all have the same heat resistance
c) Spores of the same strain have many spores of low heat resistance
d) Spores of the same strain have very few spores of high heat resistance
a
2. Since the starting point of ‘a’ on the y-axis is higher than in the other suspension, the first statement makes sense.
All the other statements definitely aren’t comprehended by the graph and some of them are only speculations by various researchers. 
13. Between the following factors, which of the following have maximum effect on highly heat resistant spores?
a) Wetted
b) Alternately wetted and dried
c) Dried
d) Frozen
c
14. Statement 1: The physical environment in which a spore is grown has minimal affect on its heat resistance.
Statement 2: Freezing weakens spores.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
b
15. Statement 1: Spores heated in soil directly are more heat resistant than ones which are mixed with sterile soils and then heated.
Statement 2: Thermophilic bacteria which form spores in artificial media are more heat resistant than those formed on machinery in canning plants.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
b
