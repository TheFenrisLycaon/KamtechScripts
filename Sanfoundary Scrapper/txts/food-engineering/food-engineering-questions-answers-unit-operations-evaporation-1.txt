a) Low, minimum
b) High, maximum
c) Low, maximum
d) High, minimum
a
3. Which of the following is true while concentrating jams?
a) They’re sensitive to heat
b) Evaporation process for jams is carried out under vacuum
c) At vacuum, the boiling point decreases
d) All of the mentioned
d
4. Statement 1: Boiling point rise is due to the colligative properties due to the presence of solid particles in the solvent.
Statement 2: Boiling point rise is due to the increase in pressure at the bottom of the solvent due to hydro-static head of the column.
a) True, False

c) False, False
d) False, True
b
5. Statement 1: Duhring’s rule states that the ratio of temperatures at which two solutions have the same vapor pressure is constant.
Statement 2: Duhring’s rule states that the boiling point of a solution is a linear function of the boiling point of pure water at the same pressure.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
b
6. Statement 1: In a multiple effect evaporator, the overall temperature drop is equal to the individual drops at each step.
Statement 2: In a multiple effect evaporator, the total area is equal to the sum of the individual areas.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
c
7. Statement 1: Forward feeding requires pumps for the feed at every step.
Statement 2: In a backward feeding arrangement, the most concentrated feed is exposed to the maximum steam in order to remove heat.  This is its advantage.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
d
8. One disadvantage with backward feeding is that the feed gets very concentrated at the beginning few units itself and hence it’s difficult to feed it to the next evaporator unit.
a) True
b) False
b
9. Mixed feed arrangement offers the advantage of omitting the usage of pumps by transferring feed in the direction of low pressure. That’s an advantage taken from forward feeding arrangement.
a) True
b) False
a
