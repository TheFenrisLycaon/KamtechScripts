1. Which of the following is true about Natural Convection?
a) Low heat transfer
b) Due to gravity and natural buoyant forces
c) Dependent on viscosity, density and thermal conductivity
d) All of the mentioned
d
2. __________ is when nucleate boiling transforms to film boiling.
a) Critical temperature
b) Leiden frost point
c) Critical temperature & Leiden frost point
d) None of the mentioned
b
3. Statement 1: Nucleate Boiling is when a layer of film is formed in the beginning.
Statement 2: Boiling starts with the bottom layer which heats up, becomes light and goes up. That way everything becomes hot and there is not temperature difference and hence no heat transfer.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
d
4. Statement 1: When heat transfer takes between a solid surface and a fluid, an insulating film layer is formed. More is the agitation; more is the thickness of the film.
Statement 2: Within the film, the temperature varies from the wall to the temperature of the bulk.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
d
5. Statement 1: NPr= (Cp μ)/k
Statement 2: If NPr is lesser than 1, Thermal Boundary layer is thinner than Hydrodynamic Boundary layer.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True

6. Why is better to use a Jacketed vessel in the dairy industry than a stainless steel container directly?
a) To prevent milk from charring
b) To have a better temperature control
c) The temperature of food in the film = temperature of the wall which is very high. Hence, jacketed vessels are needed
d) All of the mentioned
d
7. Statement 1: hd/k  is _____
Statement 2: _____ is the ratio of convective heat transfer to conductive heat transfer.
a) Prandtl number, Prandtl number
b) Nussel number, Nussel number

d) Fourier number, Fourier number
b
8. The reciprocal of heat transfer co-efficient is _____
a) Conductance
b) Resistance
c) Density
d) Temperature difference
b
9. Statement 1: Film-type condensation has a higher heat transfer co-efficient than drop-wise condensation.
Statement 2: Drop-wise condensation is easier to maintain than Film-type condensation
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
c
10. Statement 1: Drop-wise condensation takes place on a smooth surface.
Statement 2: All the resistance to heat transfer lies in the film formed during Film-type condensation.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
d
