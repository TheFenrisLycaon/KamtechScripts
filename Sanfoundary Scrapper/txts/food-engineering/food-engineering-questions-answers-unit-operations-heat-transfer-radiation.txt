1. Statement 1: Radiation is the transfer of heat by electromagnetic waves.
Statement 2: When heat is radiated from a hot source, the amount of heat received by the body depends on the nature of the body.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
b
2. Statement 1: Radiation needs a medium to travel.
Statement 2: Thermal radiation takes place at a certain temperature for every body.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
c
3. Statement 1: Radiation is NOT heat.
Statement 2: Maximum value of absorptivity is 1.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
b
4. The emission of radiation by any body is independent of the radiation by any body next to it.
a) True
b) False
a
5. A food industry keeps food cool in a very crude manner, by radiation. It paints its walls white and not black, because of _____
a) Kirchhoff’s Law
b) Stephan-Boltzmann Law
c) None of the mentioned
d) Kirchhoff’s Law & Stephan-Boltzmann Law
a
6. Which of the following reason does NOT affect radiation between two parallel bodies?
a) Angle of vision
b) Orientation of surfaces
c) Emissivity of both
d) Smoothness and roughness
a
7. Freezer is at -18 deg C. Will will be Radiative heat transfer if meat is at 298k, its emissivity is 0.82 and average area is 0.045m2.
Either use Stefan Boltzmann law or take hr (radiative heat transfer co-efficient) as 0.227.
ε = ( Tav/100 )3
a) 7.61
b) 6.94
c) 8.43
d) None of the mentioned
a
T1 = 298, T2 = 255. σ= 5.67*10-8 W /m2K4
T14 = 7.88 * 109
T24 = 4.22* 109
Using, q = A εσ (T14 – T24)
q = 5.7 * 10-8 * 0.82* 0.45 * (7.88-4.22) * 109 = 7.61.
Tav= (298 + 255) /2
hr = 3.93 W/m2 K
 q = A εσ (T1 -T2) = 3.93* 0.045 * (298-255) = 7.61. 
8. Statement 1: Radiation dryers are used to dry grains and reduce their moisture content before storage.
Statement 2: Baking ovens are used both for making the dough and after that’s made, making biscuits by cutting them and baking them further. This entire process uses radiation.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, False
d) False, True
b
9. In deep freezers, the walls absorb heat from food materials by _____ and keep them cool.
a) Conduction
b) Convection
c) Radiation
d) None of the mentioned
c
10. Radiation dryers use _____
a) Ultraviolet rays
b) Infrared radiation
c) Visible range
d) None of the mentioned
b
