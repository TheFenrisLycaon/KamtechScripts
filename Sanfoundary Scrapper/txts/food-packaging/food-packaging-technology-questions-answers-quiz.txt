a) boron
b) alumina
c) lead
d) alkali flux
b
11. Silica is combined with lead in glass due to which of the following reasons?
a) Reduce the leaching of sodium
b) Hardness and durability
c) Clarity and brilliance
d) Preventing the glass from dissolving in water
c
Alumina increases hardness and durability.
6% boron reduces the leaching of sodium.
Calcium and magnesium carbonates (limestone and dolomite) acts as stabilizers, preventing the glass from dissolving in water.

a) Closures to retain internal pressure
b) Closures to contain and protect contents
c) Closures to maintain vacuum inside container
d) Closures to secure contents inside containe
c
i. Closures to retain internal pressure – They retain an internal pressure of 200-800 kPa, as found in carbonated drinks and beer. Ex. Crown cork, Roll-on tamper evident aluminum closure
ii. Closures to contain and protect contents – They contain and protect the contents with no internal pressure (Ex. Wine in a bottle). Ex. Bark cork
iii. Closures to maintain vacuum inside container – They maintain a vacuum inside glass containers that typically contain heat-processed food. Ex. Lug-type or twist cap, Press-on twist –off cap, Pry-off (side seal) cap
iv. Closures to secure contents inside container – They are to secure the contents inside the glass container (Ex. Peanut butter).
