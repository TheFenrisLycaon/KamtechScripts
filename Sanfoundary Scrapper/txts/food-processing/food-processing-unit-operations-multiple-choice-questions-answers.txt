b) To predict the concentration change
c) To predict the pressure change
d) To predict the mole fraction
a
3. What is partial pressure of water vapor?
a) 23.8 mm Hg
b) 230.8 mm Hg
c) 2.38 mm Hg
d) 0.238 mm Hg
a
4. What is r value in pV= nRT?
a) 0.8314 J/mol•K
b) 831.4 J/mol•K
c) 83.14 J/mol•K
d) 8.314 J/mol•K
d
5. Which of the following component is constant in Boyle’s law?
a) Concentration
b) Pressure
c) Temperature
d) Volume
c
6. Does partial pressure depend on temperature?
a) True
b) False
a
7. What is the limitation of Dalton’s law?
a) It implies only for real gases at low pressure
b) It implies only for real gases at high pressure
c) It implies only for real gases at low concentration
d) It implies only for real gases at high concentration
a
8. Which of the following statements about partial pressure are correct?
Statement 1: The partial pressure of each gas in a mixture is not proportional to its mole fraction..
Statement 2: The partial pressure of each gas is the product of the total pressure and the mole fraction of that gas.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, True
d) False, False
c
9. In an experiment,the barometric pressure of gas is 1.043 atm, Some H2 was collected over water at 27.0°C.  What is the partial pressure of the dry H2 in the container?
a) 0.1021 atm
b) 102.1 atm
c) 10.21 atm
d) 1.021 atm
d
PTotal = 1.056atm
PH2O(at 27°C) = 0.035 atm
Therefore, PTotal = PH2O + PH2
PH2 = PT − PH2O
PH2 = 1.056 atm – 0.035 atm = 1.021 atm
10. The pressure of a 2.74moles of a gas in a container was 432.0 torr.  What would the pressure inside the container be if 5.05 moles of the gas was in it?
a) 896.20 torr
b) 796.20 torr
c) 596.20 torr
d) 696.20 torr
b
n1 = 2.74 mol      P1 = 432.0torr
n2 = 5.05mol P2 =?
Therefore, according to Dalton’s law,
P1/n1=P2/n2
P2 = P1n2/n1
= (432.0 torr)(5.05mol)/2.74mol
= 796.20torr
