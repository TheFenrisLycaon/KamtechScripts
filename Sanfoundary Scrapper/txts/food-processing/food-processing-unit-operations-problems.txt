1. What is equilibrium constant expression?
a) The ratio of the concentrations of the reactants and molar constant and products
b) The ratio of the concentrations of the products and reactants
c) The ratio of the concentrations of the reactants and products
d) The ratio of the concentrations of the catalyst and products
c
2. How does increase in concentration affect equilibrium?
a) It will shift towards the products.
b) It will shift towards the reactants.
c) No change
d) It will shift according to pressure change
a
3. What affects equilibrium?
a) Changes in concentration
b) Changes in and pressure
c) Changes in temperature
d) Changes in concentration, temperature, and pressure
d
4. Do catalysts affect equilibrium?
a) True
b) False
b
5. What is the relation between Kp and K?
a) Kp=K(RT)Δn
b) Kp=K-(RT)Δn
c) Kp=K+(RT)Δn
d) Kp=K/(RT)Δn
a
6. The equilibrium constant for the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to give ammonia is 0.95 at 745 K. The balanced equilibrium equation is as follows:
N2(g)+3H2(g)⇌2NH3(g)
What is Kp for this reaction at the same temperature?
a) 2.54×10-4
b) 3.85×10-4
c) 4.27×10-4
d) 3.73×10-4
a
Kp=K(RT)−2
0.95 x {[0.08206(L⋅atm)/(mol⋅K)][745K]}-2 = 2.54×10-4.
