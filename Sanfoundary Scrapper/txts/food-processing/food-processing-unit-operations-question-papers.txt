1. Which unit operation involves the mechanically induced establishment of a flow pattern in a liquid mixture?
a) Sedimentation
b) Agitation
c) Mixing
d) Crystallization
b
2. The figure given below is a 3 bladed device, used to produce Agitation in liquids. Name it.
a) Turbine
b) Distributor
c) Blender
d) Propeller
d
3. The role of Baffles is to improve mixing and remove stratification during agitation.
a) True
b) False
a
4. The formula Np=\(\frac{P}{n^3Da^5\rho}\) denotes which number in impeller problems?
a) Weber number
b) Froude number
c) Power number
d) Euler Number
c
5. A flat blade turbine having six blades is centrally installed in a vertical tank. The tank is 6 ft (1.83 m) in diameter; the turbine is 2 ft. (0.61 m) in diameter and is positioned 2 ft (0.61 m) from the bottom of the tank. The turbine blades are 5 in. (127 mm) wide. The tank is filled to a depth of 6 ft (1.83 m) with a solution of 50 percent caustic soda, at 150°F (65.6°C), which has a viscosity of 12 cP and a density of 93.5 lb/ft3 (1498 kg/m3). The turbine is operated at 90 r/min. the tank is baffled. What power will be required to operate the mixer? (Given KL=403680).
a) 2.47 kW
b) 6.05 kW
c) 3.21 kW
d) 4.00 kW
a
NRe = \(\frac{Da^2n\rho}{μ}\) = \(\frac{2^2X1.5X93.5}{8.06 X 10^{-3}}\) = 69,600
We know that at low Reynold’s number for both baffled and unbaffled tanks, the relationship is given by
Np =\(\frac{K_L}{N_{Re}}\) = \(\frac{403680}{69600}\) = 5.8
P = \(\frac{5.8 X 93.5 X 1.5^3  X 2^2}{32.17}\)=1821 ft-lb/s
The power requirement is 1821/550 = 2.47 kW (3.31 hp).
6. Which one is not the purpose of establishment of agitation in fluids?
a) Suspension of solid particles
b) Blending of solids
c) Blending miscible liquids
d) Promoting heat transfer
b
7. An agitator is selected depending upon the __________
a) Volume of liquid
b) Height of the tank
c) Power required
d) Fluid viscosity
d
8. Name the type of impeller used for agitation of low viscosity fluids, on high speeds?
a) Propeller
b) Concave Blade Impeller
c) Straight blade turbine
d) Paddles
a
9. Power consumption of agitators is a function of ________
a) Impeller used
b) Volumetric flow rate
c) Volumetric flow rate and Kinetic Energy
d) Kinetic Energy
c
10. How can swirling be prevented in agitated vessels?
a) By reducing the power provided
b) By the use of turbines
c) By the use of Baffles
d) By lowering the shaft
c
