1. What type of energy is considered in enthalpy balance?
a) Heat only
b) Heat and mass only
c) Mass only
d) Heat and potential energy only
a
2. Which of the following is considered in a continuous process?
a) Mass balance
b) Energy balance
c) Time
d) Mass balance, energy balance and time
d
3. A processing unit is producing a product of 100kg which must contain 15% of fat and this is to be made up from component A with 23% of fat and from component B with 5% of fat. What are the proportions in which these should be mixed?
a) 44.4 kg of component A to 55.6kg of component B
b) 67.87kg of component A to 32.13kg of component B
c) 55.6 kg of component A to 44.4kg of component B
d) 32.13kg of component A to 67.87kg of component B
c
Then by a mass balance on the fat,
(X × 0.23)+ (Y × 0.05) = (X+Y) × 0.15
A (0.23-0.15) = B (0.15-0.05)
A (0.08) =B (0.10)
A/B= 5/9
Therefore, 100kg of product will have 55.6 kg of component A to 44.4kg of component B.

b
6. Which of the following statements about First law of thermodynamics are correct?

b) True, True
c) False, True
d) False, False
b
7. What type of energy is enthalpy?
a) Internal potential energy
b) Kinetic energy
c) Dynamic kinetic energy
d) It is not a type of energy
d
8. What are the properties to be considered for designing a unit operation equipment?
