1. At what point does liquid and solid exist at equilibrium?
a) Double point
b) Triple point
c) Dew point
d) Freezing point
b
2. Is the value of equilibrium constant independent of initial concentrations of the reactants and products?
a) True
b) False
a
3. Who coined the term triple point?
a) James Thomson
b) Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit
c) Carrier
d) Rudolf Clausius
a
4. Which of the following is not an example of freezing point depression?
a) Salt in water
b) Cooling the hot water
c) Alcohol in water
d) Mixing of impurities into a fine powder
c
5. What is peritectic?
a) A reaction between solid phase and gas phase to form a second solid phase
b) A reaction between solid phase and liquid phase to form a second solid phase
c) A reaction between gas phase and liquid phase to form a second solid phase
d) A reaction between solid phase and liquid phase to form a second liquid phase
b
6. Are these statements about the dynamic equilibrium true?
Statement 1: Opposing processes occur at the same time.
Statement 2: Two processes occur at the same rate.
a) True, False
b) True, True
c) False, True
d) False, False
b
7. What is the temperature at which the solid and liquid phases are at equilibrium?
a) Normal melting point
b) Bubble point
c) Dew point
d) Equilibrium point
a
8. At equilibrium, the concentrations of N2=4.0 x10-3M, O2 = 5.2 x 10-3M and NO=3.9×10-3M in a sealed vessel at 800K. What will be Kc for the reaction?
a) 0.731
b) 0.073
c) 7.31
d) 0.0007
a
Kc = [NO]2/[N2][O2]
= (3.9 x 10-3)2/(4.0×10-3M)(5.2×10-3M)
= 0.731
