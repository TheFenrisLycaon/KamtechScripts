1. Falling film evaporators are a subclass of long tube evaporators.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Falling film evaporators can be operated in _______________
a) Counter-flow with the vapour
b) Co-current flow with vapour
c) Both co-current and counter-current
d) Separate segments in any direction
c
3. Falling film evaporators are considered over climbing film evaporators because of which one of the following factor?
a) Efficiency
b) Product holdup
c) Driving force requirement
d) Temperature sensitivity
a
4. The applications of falling film and rising film are more or less same, but if industries have the cost capital, they go for falling film, why?
a) It has high temperature gradient and natural convection
b) Better efficiency of falling film
c) It has less temperature gradient and natural convection
d) No need for upward pressure
b
5. Falling film evaporators are best suited for pharmaceutical industries because
a) It has high temperature gradient and natural convection
b) Low pressure
c) It has less temperature gradient and natural convection
d) High headroom available
c
6. Falling film evaporators can be used with the fluid falling over
(i) Plates
(ii) Coils
(iii) Horizontal tubes
(iv) Vertical tubes
a) (i)(ii)(iii)
b) (i)(ii)
c) (i)(iii)(iv)
d) (i)(ii)(iii)(iv)
d
7. Falling film evaporators have __________ product holdup.
a) Large
b) Very high
c) Low
d) Zero
c
8. Which one of the following is not an advantage of falling film evaporator?
a) Relatively low cost
b) High headroom
c) Large surface area for heating available
d) Low product holdup
b
i. Low manufacturing and running cost
ii. Large surface for in a single body
iii. Low product hold-up
iv. Small floor space requirements
v. Good heat-transfer coefficients at reasonable temperature differences.
9. Which one of the following cannot be regarded as a demerit of falling film evaporator?
a) High headroom requirement
b) Corrosive fluids cannot be used
c) Large product holdup
d) Recirculation needed
c
i. High headroom requirement
ii. Generally not suited for corrosive or scaling materials
iii. Requires recirculation
Whereas the falling film evaporator with its falling area has very low product holdup.

a)  
b)  
c)  
d)  
b
