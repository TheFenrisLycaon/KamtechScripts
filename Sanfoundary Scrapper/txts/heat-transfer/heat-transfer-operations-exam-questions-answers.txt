11. The utility of fin in dissipating a given quantity of heat is generally assessed on the basis of which of the parameters given?
a) Effectiveness and efficiency
b) Effectiveness
c) Efficiency
d) Fin length
a
12. What is the heat transfer area for the following setup?
Given the thickness of fin = 5mm, diameter of inner and outer tube are 20mm and 40mm respectively and the length of tube is 1metre.
a) 0.3m2
b) 0.23m2
c) 0.123m2
d) 0.223m2
c
Hence the value is =(πDi-4xt+4x2xLfin)xL=\(\frac{(3.14X20-4X5+4X2X10)x1}{1000}\)=0.123m2.
13. What is the flow area of the given setup of fins in double pipe heat exchanger?
Given the thickness of fin = 5mm, diameter of inner and outer tube are 20mm and 40mm respectively and the length of tube is 1metre.
a) 742mm2
b) 642m2
c) 642mm2
d) 742m2
a
Hence the value is = (\(\frac{π}{4}\)(Do2-Di2))- 4xtxLfin=\(\frac{3.14}{4}\)x(402-202)-4x5x10=742mm2.
14. What is the efficiency of an infinitely long fin?
a) \(\frac{1}{mL}\) 
b) \(\frac{2}{mL}\)

d) \(\sqrt{hPKA}\) 
b
E = Qfin / Qno fin
Ab is the cross sectional area of the fin at the base
Qno fin represents the rate of heat transfer from this area if no fins are attached to the surface
∈FIN=\(\frac{Q_{FIN}}{Q_{NO\, FIN}}\frac{\sqrt{hPKA_c}(T_b-T_∞)}{hA_b(T_b-T_∞)}=\sqrt{\frac{KP}{hA_c}}\).
