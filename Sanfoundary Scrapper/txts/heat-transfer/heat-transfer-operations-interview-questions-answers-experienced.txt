10. Consider we have a 2-4Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger, with the inner tube of Outer diameter 20mm (thickness 2mm) and shell of inner diameter 100mm. We have two fluids A & B, both of density 990 Kg/m3, we desire to have their flow rates as 15 m/s and 21 m/s respectively, friction factor of 0.00096 and 4 tube of length 0.4 m and 2shell passes.

a) No, since pressure drop is less than specified
b) Yes, since pressure drop is less than specified
c) No, since pressure drop is more than specified
d) Yes, since pressure drop is more than specified
c
11. In the calculation of Reynold’s Number for the Friction factor of the shell, which is the correct formula for equivalent diameter De?
a) \(\frac{4×(D_{oi}^2 – D_{io}^2)×\frac{π}{4}}{π(D_{io})}\) 
b) \(\frac{4×(D_{io}^2 – D_{oi}^2)×\frac{π}{4}}{π(D_{io})}\) 
c) Depends on the pitch

12. Consider we have a shell and tube Heat Exchanger, with the inner tube of diameter 30mm (neglect thickness) and shell of diameter 100mm. We have two fluids A & B (both with viscosity 2.5×10-5Pa-s), we desire to have their flow rates as 4 Kg/s(tube) and 5.3 Kg/s(shell) respectively. What is the Friction Factor (F) for this setup for the shell if it has triangular pitch with Pitch = 40mm?
a) 0.0086
b) 0.0103
c) 0.086
d) 0.00103
b
D=\(\frac{4(\frac{0.86}{2}Pt^2-\frac{\frac{π}{2}OD^2}{4})}{\frac{π}{2}OD} = \frac{4(\frac{0.86}{2}40^2-\frac{\frac{1}{2}30^2}{4})}{\frac{1}{2}π30}\) 
We have Re = GD/µ, where D = 28.43 mm, hence
Re = 5.3×(28.43)×10-3/(2.5×10-5) = 6027.
Now the friction factor F can be calculated by F = 0.0035+ \(\frac{0.264}{Re^{0.42}}\)  = 0.0103.
13. If there are N shell passes in a shell and tube HE, then which one of the following relation is correct foe the pressure drop a shell side?
a) \((\frac{FL}{D}+4×N)\frac{v^2ρ}{2}\) 
b) \((\frac{FL}{D}+N)\frac{v^2ρ}{2}\) 
c) \((\frac{4FL}{D}+N)\frac{v^2ρ}{2}\) 
d) \((\frac{4FL}{D}+4×N)\frac{v^2ρ}{2}\) 
a
ΔP = \((\frac{FL}{D}+4×N)\frac{v^2ρ}{2}\), which is different from that double pipe heat exchanger when it comes to return losses.
