8. In a shell and tube heat exchanger, in the inner side fluid enters at 15℃ and leaves at 65℃. The shell has steam at 1atm. What is the value of corrected LMTD and correction factor?
a) 39℃, F = 0
b) 56.35℃, F = 0
c) 70℃, F = 1
d) 56.35℃, F = 1
d
LMTD = \(\frac{(TH1-TC2)-(TH2-TC1)}{Ln(\frac{TH1-TC2}{TH2-TC1})}\) 
LMTD = \(\frac{(100-15)-(100-65)}{Ln(\frac{100-15}{100-65})}\) = 56.35℃.
