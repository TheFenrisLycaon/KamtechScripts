14. What is the expression for the rate of heat transfer for a cylindrical insulating wall covering a hot fluid?
a) Q =  \(\frac{2\pi(T-T_\infty)K}{\frac{K}{HR_2}+ln (\frac{R_2}{R_1})}\) 
b) Q =  \(\frac{2\pi(T_\infty-T)K}{\frac{K}{HR_1}+ln (\frac{R_2}{R_1})}\) 
c) Q =  \(\frac{2\pi(T-T_\infty)K}{\frac{K}{HR_2}+ln (\frac{R_1}{R_2})}\) 
d) Q =  \(\frac{2\pi(T_\infty-T)K}{\frac{K}{HR_2}+ln (\frac{R_2}{R_1})}\) 
a
Q = \(\frac{(T-T_\infty)}{\frac{1}{2\pi HR_2}+\frac{ln(\frac{R_2}{R_1})}{2\pi K}} \) 
15. For the calculation of critical radius of insulation for a cylindrical tube, which of the following differentiation is correct?
a) \(\frac{d(\frac{K}{HR_2}+ln(\frac{R_2}{R_1}))}{dR_1}\) = 0
b) \(\frac{d(\frac{K}{HR_1}+ln(\frac{R_2}{R_1}))}{dR_2}\) = 0
c) \(\frac{d(\frac{K}{HR_2}+ln(\frac{R_1}{R_2}))}{dR_1}\) = 0
d) \(\frac{d(\frac{K}{HR_2}+ln(\frac{R_2}{R_1}))}{dR_2}\) = 0
d
Q =  \(\frac{2\pi(T-T_\infty)K}{\frac{K}{HR_2}+ln(\frac{R_2}{R_1})}\) 
thus to calculate the maximum heat transfer rate at a given thickness, we differentiate the denominator to zero for the minimum of the denominator component which will fetch us the maximum heat transfer rate Q. We differentiate it with respect to R2 as it is the only variable with R1 a fixed constant.
