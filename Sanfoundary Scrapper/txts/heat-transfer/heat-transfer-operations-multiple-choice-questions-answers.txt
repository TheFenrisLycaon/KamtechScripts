11. Which one of the following is the correct expression for Friction Factor in Packed Bed Columns?
a) f = 150/Re
b) f = 150/Re+1.75
c) f = 180/Re+1.5
d) f = 100/Re+0.0035

12. Calculate the pressure drop in the following setup.
Density = 990 Kg/m3
Superficial velocity = 10m/s
DP = 3mm
Porosity = 0.14

Column length = 1m
a) 7Pa
b) 724×106Pa
c) 7×106Pa
d) 72atm
b
Now the Friction Factor is = 150/Re +1.75 =  150/2.76×105+1.75 = 1.751, hence the formula for pressure drop is, f = \(\frac{∆P}{L} \frac{Dp}{\rho\vartheta_s^2}(\frac{\in^3}{1-\in}) or
 ∆P⁄L=[latex]\frac{f}{\frac{Dp}{\rho\vartheta_s^2}(\frac{\in^3}{1-\in})}\) = \(\frac{1.751}{\frac{0.003}{990×2*2}×\frac{0.14^3}{1-0.14}}\) = 724×106Pa.
