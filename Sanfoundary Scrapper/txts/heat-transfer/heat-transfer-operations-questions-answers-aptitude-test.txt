1. Velocity profile in a pipe is independent of axial position whereas Temperature Profile is not.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Which is the correct representation of Temperature profile in a fully developed Pipe flow?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
3. What is the Velocity Profile of a hot Liquid flowing through a Pipe?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
4. A liquid is heated by passing it through a circular pipe (kpipe = 15W/mK, viscosity = 2.5×10-5 Pa-s, Cp = 1000 J/Kg-K, kliquid = 0.035 W/mK) of ID = 25mm and OD = 30mm with length L = 15 m. If the Reynolds No. is 79000. What is the outer surface average heat transfer coefficient?
a) 773KW/m2K
b) 83KW/m2K
c) 104KW/m2K
d) 43KW/m2K
b
here Pr = Cpxμ/k, density=1Kg/m3 Hence Pr = 0.7
Nu = h×OD/kpipe = 165, h = 83KW/m2K.
5. What is the Velocity Profile of a hot Gas flowing through a Pipe?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
a
6. Given a fluid enters at a temperature of 22℃into a pipe of length 1m. On fully developed thermal flow, the wall temperature is 92℃, determine the temperature of the bulk of the liquid at exit. (Given λ = 0.5)
a) 50℃
b) 100℃
c) 104℃
d) 150℃
a
Tbulk – Twall = (Tinlet – Twall)exp(-λL)
Where we have Tinlet = 22 ℃ and Twall = 92 ℃, putting values we get Tbulk = 50 ℃.
7. The temperature profile of a fully developed Thermal flow in a pipe of length L can be defined by the formula. Tbulk – Twall = (Tinlet – Twall)eλL
a) True
b) False
a
8. Given the convective heat transfer Coefficient of the inner surface to be 15W/m2K, OD = 30mm and ID = 25mm. Find the outer surface heat transfer coefficient.
a) 15 W/m2K
b) 12 W/m2K
c) 12.5 W/m2K
d) 13.5 W/m2K
c
hinner ×ID = houter × OD
Hence, houter = 15×25/30 = 12.5W/m2K.
9. A non-conducting liquid is passed inside a metal tube carrying electricity (Voltage=220V, current=0.5A), what is the final temperature of the bulk of liquid if it enters at 10℃. (h =100 W/m2K, Area =0.2m2)
a) 25.5℃
b) 15.0℃
c) 15.5℃
d) 14.5℃
c
Hence final temperature, 110 = hA(To-Ti)
To = 110/(100×0.2) + 10 = 15.5 ℃.
10. How can we graphically represent the temperature profile of a fluid flowing through a hot pipe with constant wall temperature?
Tc = Temperature along the axis of the pipe
Tw = Wall temperature
a) 
b) 
c) 
d) 
d
11. How can we graphically represent the temperature profile of a fluid flowing through a hot pipe with constant heat flux?
Tc = Temperature of the wall
Tb = Bulk Temperature
a)  
b) 
c) 
d) 
b
