1. The milk while boiling in an open vessel spills out because of the ___________ phenomenon.
a) Sub-cooled boiling
b) Super-cooled boiling
c) Sub-heated boiling
d) Super-heated boiling
a
2. What is the relation between the vapour temperature and the liquid temperature on nucleation for a bubble inside the fluid?
a) Tv – Tsat = (2 σ/r – pg) Rv Tv/pv hfg
b) Tv – Tsat = (2 σ/r – pg) Rv Tv2/pv hfg
c) Tv – Tsat = (2 σ/r – pg) Rv Tv2pv hfg
d) Tv – Tsat = (2 σ – pg) Rv Tv2/pv hfg
b
Tv – Tsat = (2 σ/r – pg) Rv Tv2/pv hfg, which can be easily derived by sufficient energy balance.
3. Spherical bubbles of diameter 3 mm are observed in the bubble boiling phase of water at 1 atmosphere pressure. Assuming pure water vapour is present inside the bubbles, calculate the temperature of that vapour.
Given Surface tension = 73mN/m
R/pgfg = 0.000014
a) 119.387 ℃
b) 200.217 ℃
c) 300.217 ℃
d) 400.217 ℃
a
 Tv – Tsat = (2 σ/r) Rv Tv2/pv hfg representing as a quadratic we get, 0.00136 Tv2 – Tv + 100 = 0
Shift+Solve on Scientific calculator gives us 119.4℃
4. Spherical bubbles of diameter 3 mm are observed in the bubble boiling phase of water at 1 atmosphere pressure. Assuming pure wateRvapour is present inside the bubbles, calculate the temperature of that vapour.
Given Surface tension = 73mN/m
R/pgfg = 0.000014
What region of boiling is this ocurring if we consider the two answers we get?
a) Evaporation and Bubble growth
b) Stable film and Evaporation
c) Unstable film and Radiation
d) Nucleate and Stable film
d
 Tv – Tsat = (2 σ/r) Rv Tv2/pv hfgrepresenting as a quadratic we get, 0.00136 Tv2 – Tv+ 100 = 0
Shift+Solve on Scientific calculator gives us 119.4℃ and 615.91℃. Hence the latter is Nucleate while the former is Stable film.
5. Which one of the following statement is incorrect?

b) Nucleate boiling is promoted on a smooth surface than a rough one
c) Film boiling region is usually avoided in commercial equipment
d) The point of transition from nucleate to film boiling is known as the burn-out point on the boiling curve
b
6. Consider a situation when evaporation takes place at the liquid-vapour interface in which the heat transfer is mainly due to free convection then the Nusselt Number for the film follows which one of the following relation?
a) Nu = F1 Gr F2 Pr
b) Nu = 4 F1 Gr F2 Pr
c) Nu = 2 F1 Gr F2 Pr
d) Nu = 3 F1 Gr F2 Pr
a
7. The heat flux Q/A depends on the specific heat of the liquid Cf as which one of the following given?
a) Q/A= δf hfg [(pf – pg) g/σ]0.55 [Cf  dt/hfg p] 3
b) Q/A = δf hfg [(pf – pg) g/σ]0.6 [Cf  dt/hfg p Csf]3
c) Q/A = δf hfg [(pf – pg) g/σ]0.5 [Cf  dt/hfg p Csf]3
d) Q/A = δf hfg [(pf – pg) g/σ]0.5 [Cf  dt/hfg p Csf] 
c
\(\frac{q}{A}=\mu_Lh_{fg}[\frac{g(\rho_L-\rho_v)}{\sigma}]^\frac{1}{2}[\frac{C_{pL}(T_s T_{sat})}{C_{sf}h_{fg}Pr_L^n}]^3\).

d) Nu=\(\frac{Q}{A}\) Db KL ⁄ (Ts-Tsat)
a
9. What is the term KL in the giver equation of Nusselt number for nucleate boiling heat transfer correlations?
 Nub = \(\frac{(\frac{q}{A})D_b}{(T_s-T_{sat})k_L}\) 
a) Thermal conductivity of the vapour
b) Thermal conductivity of the liquid
c) Thermal conductivity of the film
d) Thermal conductivity of the Bubble

b) Radiation takes over
c) Convection takes over
d) Fouling occurs
a

a) Decrease the pressure
b) Increase the pressure
c) Add more water
d) Add turbulence
b
