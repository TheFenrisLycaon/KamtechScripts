1. How can boiling point elevation be achieved in Evaporators?
a) Increasing pressure
b) Decreasing pressure
c) Increasing Temperature
d) Increasing concentration
d
2. Boiling point of the solution ________ as the evaporation process proceeds.
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains same
d) Becomes half
a
3. Boiling point of a solution is a colligative property.
a) True
b) False
a
4. The boiling point of a solution is a colligative property because?
a) It depends on the temperature of solution
b) It depends on the concentration of solution
c) It depends on the applied pressure on the solution
d) It depends on the heat capacity of the solution
b
i. Vapour pressure depression
ii. Boiling point elevation
iii. Melting point depression
iv. Osmotic pressure.
Colligative properties are those properties of the liquid which change (either increase or decrease) with increasing the number of solute molecules (concentration) in the solvent.
5. Boiling point elevation causes the driving force of evaporation in the fluid to _________
a) Decrease
b) Increase
c) Remain same
d) Increase tenfold
a
6. The temperature of water vapour released from the solution after facing boiling point elevation is ________
a) Equal to 100℃
b) Below 100℃
c) Above 100℃
d) Much larger than 100℃
c
7. The vapour released from the feed after being considerably concentrated is superheated steam.
a) True
b) False
a
8. The Boiling point elevation as the evaporation in an evaporator proceeds can be approximately measured by __________
a) Duhring’s rule
b) Arrhenius rule
c) Kozeny Carman rule
d) Sieder tate rule
a
9. To help coping with boiling point elevation in evaporators, which of the following can be done?
a) Increase the feed temperature to its boiling point
b) Use superheated steam at the temperature of maximum boiling point
c) Increase pressure
d) Reduce pressure
b
10. Which one the following properties of fluid in not a colligative property?
a) Osmotic pressure
b) Surface tension
c) Boiling point elevation
d) Vapour pressure depression
b
i. Vapour pressure depression
ii. Boiling point elevation
iii. Melting point depression
iv. Osmotic pressure.
11. The vapour pressure of the solution ________ when the concentration of solutes increases.
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains same
d) Becomes zero
b
i. Vapour pressure depression
ii. Boiling point elevation
iii. Melting point depression
v. Osmotic pressure.
Hence the vapour pressure decreases on increasing concentration.
12. To cope with the change in vapour pressure with increasing concentration and considering the sensitivity of the solution to high temperatures, which one of the following step can be undertaken?
a) Increase the feed temperature to its boiling point
b) Use superheated steam at the temperature of maximum boiling point
c) Increase pressure
d) Reduce pressure
d
