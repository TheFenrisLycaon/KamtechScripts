1. In the given setup, what is the capacity of this forward feed evaporator?
a) E1 + E2 + E3
b) E3
c) E1
d) E1 + E2
a
2. In the given setup, what is the capacity of the 2nd effect of this parallel feed evaporator?
a) E1 + E2 + E3
b) E3
c) E2
d) E1 + E2
a
3. What is the economy of the given Forward feed evaporator?
a) ∈ =  S /(E1+E2+E3)
b) ∈ =  E1/(E1+E2+E3)
c) ∈ =  E3/E2
d) ∈ =  E2/E1
d
As the capacity = total water evaporated = E2 and the consumption = E1.
4. What is the economy of the 3rd effect in the following mixed feed evaporator?
a) ∈ =  S/(E1+E2+E3)
b) ∈ =  E1/(E1+E2+E3)
c) ∈ =  E3/E2
d) ∈ =  E2/E1
c
As the capacity = total water evaporated = E3 and the consumption = E2.
5. We have a triple effect evaporator which has steam supply of 5kg/hr, the setup is a forward pass setup, feed enters the 1st setup at 10kg/hr of 50% concentration and leaves the final effect at 75% concentration. What is the evaporate discharged if the total evaporate from 1st and 2nd effect are 2kg/hr and 1kg/hr respectively?
a) 6.67 kg/hr
b) 3.33 kg/hr
c) 0.36 kg/hr
d) 0.33 kg/hr
d
6. We have a triple effect evaporator which has steam supply of 5kg/hr, the setup is a forward pass setup, feed enters the 1st setup at 10kg/hr of 50% concentration and leaves the final effect at 75% concentration. What is the product discharged from this setup?
a) 6.67kg/hr
b) 3.33kg/hr
c) 10kg/hr
d) 11kg/hr
a
7. Carry out the mass balance on the 1st effect of the following setup.
a) P3 = P1+E1
b) P3 = P1+S1
c) P1 = P3+E1
d) P = P1+E1
a
And hence the outgoing mass is Product P1  and evaporate E1.
8. The formula for the economy of the evaporator does not depend on the type of feeding.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Which type of feeding is supposed to give maximum economy to a particular consumption?
a) Forward feed
b) Backward feed
c) Parallel feed
d) Mixed feed
b
10. We have a triple effect evaporator which has steam supply of 5kg/hr, the setup is a forward pass setup, the feed enters the 1st setup at 10kg/hr of 50% concentration and leaves the final effect at 75% concentration. What is the economy of this setup?
a) 65%
b) 66%
c) 68%
d) 33%
b
11. What is the Evaporator economy of the 1st effect if we evaporate 10kg/hr of water from a feed of 50kg/hr at a temperature of 25oC to a final temperature of 100oC in an hour in a triple effect forward feed evaporator which has steam supply of 25kg/hr? Given the concentration changes from a value of 0.3 to 0.55 in the 1st effect of the setup.
Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260 kJ/kg
