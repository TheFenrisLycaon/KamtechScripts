a
6. Which of the following is not a characteristic of a Direct-Contact Exchanger?
a) Only heat Transfer occurs without any Mass -Transfer
b) The Exchanger Construction is relatively not expensive
c) The fouling problem does not generally exist, due to the absence of a separating wall (heat transfer surface) between the two fluids

a
7. The Hydraulic Diameter (DH) is defined as _____
AO : is the minimum free-flow area on one fluid side of a heat exchanger.
P  : is the wetted perimeter of flow passages of that side.
a) \(\frac{4A_o}{P}\) 
b) \(\frac{A_o}{4P}\) 
c) \(\frac{A_o}{P}\) 
d) \(\frac{8A_o}{P}\)

11. Recognize the following Baffle.
a) Triple Segmental Baffles
b) Double Segmental Baffles
c) Single Segmental Baffles
d) Quadruple Segmental Baffles
a
12. The important design and operating considerations for Extended-Surface Compact Heat Exchangers are:
(1) Both fluids may have high or low heat transfer coefficients
(2) As the tubes are very narrow (low DH), the fluid used should not be corrosive as effective cleaning of tubes is not possible.
(3) The fluid pressure drop calculation is important as a regulatory method to ensure long life of the tubes.
(4) Unlike shell and tube type heat exchangers, these are limited when it comes to operating pressure and temperature.
a) (1), (2), (3), (4)
b) (1), (4)
c) (2), (3), (4)
d) (1), (2)
c
