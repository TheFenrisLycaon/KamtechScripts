c
hINC=\(0.943[\frac{K^3 p^2 g h_{fg}}{\mu L(T_{sat} – T_L)}sin⁡\alpha]^{0.25}\) 
Hence \(\frac{h_{INC}}{h_{VER}}\) = sin⁡α0.25 = sin⁡300.25=\((\frac{1}{2})^{0.25}\)=0.50.25=0.84.
7. If we place a condenser at an angle of α to the vertical, then the convective heat transfer coefficient can be represented as ____________
a) hINC = 0.943 \(0.943[\frac{K^3 p^2 g h_{fg}}{\mu L(T_{sat} – T_L)}sin⁡\alpha]^{0.25}\) 
b) hINC = 0.943 \(0.943[\frac{K^3 p^2 g h_{fg}}{\mu L(T_{sat} – T_L)}tan\alpha]^{0.25}\) 
c) hINC = 0.943 \(0.943[\frac{K^3 p^2 g h_{fg}}{\mu L(T_{sat} – T_L)}cos⁡\alpha]^{0.25}\) 
d) hINC = 0.943 \(0.943[\frac{K^3 p^2 g h_{fg}}{\mu L(T_{sat} – T_L)}cosec⁡\alpha]^{0.25}\) 
a
hINC=\(0.943[\frac{K^3 p^2 g h_{fg}}{\mu L(T_{sat} – T_L)}sin⁡\alpha]^{0.25}\) 
Hence \(\frac{h_{INC}}{h_{VER}}\)=sin⁡α0.25, where the relation is as a sin function.
8. What is the ratio of convective heat transfer coefficients of a inclined condenser to a vertical condenser?
a) \(\frac{h_{INC}}{h_{VER}}\) = cosec⁡α0.25
b) \(\frac{h_{INC}}{h_{VER}}\) = cos⁡α
c) \(\frac{h_{INC}}{h_{VER}}\) = sin⁡α0.25
d) \(\frac{h_{INC}}{h_{VER}}\) = tan⁡α0.25
c
hINC=\(0.943[\frac{K^3 p^2 g h_{fg}}{\mu L(T_{sat} – T_L)}sin⁡\alpha]^{0.25}\) 
And
hVER=\(0.943[\frac{K^3 p^2 g h_{fg}}{\mu L(T_{sat} – T_L)}]^{0.25}\) 
Hence,\(\frac{h_{INC}}{h_{VER}}\) = sin⁡α0.25.
9. In a vertical setup of a Condenser, the value of convective heat transfer coefficient depends on the thermal conductivity as ___________
a) k0.25
b) k0.33
c) k0.75
d) k-0.5
c
hVER=\(0.943[\frac{K^3 p^2 g h_{fg}}{\mu L(T_{sat} – T_L)}]^{0.25}\) 
Hence, hVER is proportional to K0.75
