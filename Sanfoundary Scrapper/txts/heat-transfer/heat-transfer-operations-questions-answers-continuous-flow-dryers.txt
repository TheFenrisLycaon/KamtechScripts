1. Which one of the following is not a continuous feed dryer?
a) Agitated
b) Rotary
c) Drum
d) Flash
a
2. The moist feed is fed in at the _________ end of a rotary dryer and the material progresses to the ________ end, where it gets discharged.
a) Upper and Lower
b) Lower and Upper
c) Lower and Lower
d) Upper and Upper
a
3. The number of possible heat transfer units in a rotary dryer is approximately ___________
a) 2.0 – 3.0
b) 1.5 – 2.0
c) 2.5 – 6.5
d) 6.5 – 9.5
b
To determine NTU or Effectiveness Number there are some assumptions 
	The Heat exchanger has infinite length
	The rate of Heat transfer is Maximum
4. Which dryer has the following description – ‘a liquid containing dissolved solids or slurry carrying suspended solids forms a thin layer on the outside surface of a large rotating vessel’?
a) Agitated dryer
b) Drum dryer
c) Rotary dryer
d) Furnace dryer
b
5. In a drum dryer, the thickness of the slurry layer cannot be controlled.
a) True
b) False
b
6. For a single drum, the thickness of the film can be controlled by ___________ and in case of a double drum setup the thickness of product here can be controlled by ______________
a) An adjustable scraping blade, the gap between the drums
b) The drums, the fins
c) The Gap between the drums, an adjustable scraping blade
d) The fins, the drums
a
A drum dryer as given in the diagram above, a mixture of feed having quality solid suspension which is to be dried, is fed to it from the top the rotating drums which there after forms a thin layer on the surface of the rotating drum, which then falls as a powdered product at the bottom. If we use a double drum, the product layer thickness can be controlled by the gap between the two drums which can be readily adjusted.
7. Drum dryer mainly handles the materials that are too thick for a spray dryer and too thin for a rotary dryer.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Which one of the following is the most flexible continuous flow dryer?
a) Agitated dryer
b) Drum dryer
c) Rotary dryer
d) Furnace dryer
b
9. A flash dryer is similar in its operation to a _________ as the feed is dispersed finely in an upward flowing hot air.
a) Agitated dryer
b) Drum dryer
c) Rotary dryer
d) Spray dryer
d
10. Which one of the following dryers are best suited for drying of heat sensitive or easily oxidizable materials?
a) Furnace
b) Drum
c) Flash
d) Rotary
c
11. Which one of the following dryers have high drying rate but low residence time?
a) Furnace Dryer
b) Drum Dryer
c) Flash Dryer
d) Rotary Dryer
c
12. Which one of the following is not an advantage of flash dryers?
a) Low residence time
b) High drying rate
c) The thermal efficiency this type of dryer is high
d) No separate arrangement is required for transporting the dried product
c
13. For a fluidised bed dryer, which one of the following is correct?
a) Dry hot air is passed as the fluid on a bed of wet material
b) Hot fluid outside the tube containing particles
c) Wet hot air is passed as the fluid on a bed of dry material
d) Dry hot air is passed as the fluid on a packed bed of wet material
a
The dry hot air is passed as the fluid on a bed of wet material.
14. Fluidised bed dryers work best with which of the following bed material?
a) Crystalline granular solids
b) Finely divided solids
c) Powdered substance
d) Large pellet shaped
a
15. In fluidised-bed dryers, a separate component is provided in which the solids move sequentially from the inlet to outlet, such setup is known as ______________ where the residence time is more or less the same for all particles in that compartment.
a) Drum dryers
b) Plug flow dryers
c) Fluidised bed dryers
d) Rotary dryers
b
