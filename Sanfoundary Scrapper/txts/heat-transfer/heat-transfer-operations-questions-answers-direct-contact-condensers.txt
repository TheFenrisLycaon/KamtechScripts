1. Tubular condensers used in power plant to condense exhaust steam are known as ____________
a) Surface Condenser
b) Spray Condenser
c) Baffled column
d) Packed column
a
2. Which one of the following is not a direct contact condenser?
a) Spray
b) Baffled column
c) Packed column
d) Shell and tube
d
	The Spray Condenser
	The Baffled Column
	The Packed Column
	The Jet Condenser
	The Sparge Pipe
3. The condenser is one in which the coolant is not brought into contact with the vapour. Which one of the following is one of them?
a) Packed Column
b) Baffled shell and tube Column
c) Jet Condenser
d) Spray Condenser
b
4. Which one of the following condenser matches to this description-‘The nozzles and vessel are designed to produce a fine spray of liquid to give a large interfacial area for heat transfer and a long enough residence time of liquid droplets in the vessel’?
a) Spray Column
b) Tray
c) Packed
d) Baffled
a
5. Which one of the following condenser matches to this description-‘This condenser is similar to the spray condenser, with the only difference that the coolant is directed to flow over a series of trays in a column’?
a) Spray Column
b) Tray
c) Packed
d) Baffled
d
It has trays that obstruct the direct fall of the coolant and also increases the residence time of the coolant, hence increasing the efficiency of the condenser.
6. A ___________ consists of tightly-packed cold metal rings where heat transfer with vapour stream occurs and the vapour is condensed to its way upward.
a) Spray Column
b) Tray Column
c) Packed Column
d) Baffled Column
c
where the hot air comes directly in contact with the substance or the cold material, which condenses the vapour and releases the dry gas from top.
7. Which of the following direct contact condenser has the maximum pressure drop as compared to other condensers?
a) Spray Column
b) Tray Column
c) Packed Column
d) Baffled Column
c
8. Which one of the following condenser matches to this description-‘This condenser uses a jet of coolant liquid forced into a hot vapour stream, usually with the objective of de-superheating the vapour and hence condensing it’?
a) Jet Condenser
b) Tray Column
c) Packed Column
d) Baffled Column
a
The diagram best explains the description as we see a jet of coolant liquid forced into a hot vapour stream, de-superheating the vapour and hence condensing it.
9. In a jet condenser, the liquid is usually injected in __________ to the vapour.
a) Counter-flow
b) Co-current flow
c) Haphazard flow
d) Oscillating flow
a
10. The __________ consists of a pipe with holes for injecting bubbles of vapour into a pool of cold liquid.
a) Jet Condenser
b) Sparge pipe condenser
c) Packed Column
d) Baffled Column
b
11. ____________ is an unstable condition in a condenser when the vapour flow is such that the downward flow of condensate is interrupted and held up.
a) Overflowing
b) Flooding
c) Clogging
d) Flogging
b
12. Which one of the following pairs has similar working principles?
a) Spray and sparged
b) Sparged and baffled
c) Spray and Baffled
d) Tray and sparged
c
