3. Consider we have a Double Pipe Heat Exchanger, with the inner tube of diameter 20mm (neglect thickness) and outer tube of diameter 30mm. We have two fluids A & B, we desire to have their flow rates as 15m3/s and 21m3/s respectively. Which fluid pass arrangement would be best suited for the HE?
a) Parallel flow with A in inner pipe and B in the annulus
b) Counterflow with B in inner pipe and A in the annulus
c) Counterflow with A in inner pipe and B in the annulus
d) Parallel flow with B in inner pipe and A in the annulus
c
Flow Area in Annulus = π(Do2 – Di2)/4 = 392.7mm2, larger area hence fluid B
Flow Area in inner pipe = π(Di2)/4 = 314.2mm2, Fluid A.

a) Steam on the annular side with the fins on the cold liquid side
b) Steam on the annular side with the fins on the steam side
c) Steam on the inner side with the fins on the cold liquid side
d) Steam on the inner side with the fins on the steam side
b
8. When gas is used as a fluid in a double pipe heat exchanger, which one of the following is not true?
