1. What is defined by the term Evaporator Capacity?
a) Kg of fluid supplied in one day
b) Kg of water evaporated in one day
c) Kg of fluid supplied in 1hr
d) Kg of water evaporated in 1hr
d
2. What are the parameters to determine the evaporator economy?
a) Evaporator Capacity
b) Evaporator temperature
c) Evaporator pressure
d) Evaporator Fluid supply
a
i. Steam Consumption
ii. Evaporator capacity
As Economy = Capacity/Consumption.
3. What is the steam consumption of an evaporator if the evaporator capacity is 30kg/her and the steam consumption is 45kg/hr?
a) 67%
b) 70%
c) 80%
d) 65%
a
4. What is the Evaporator Consumption if we evaporate 10kg of water from a feed of 50kg at a temperature of 25℃ to a final temperature of 100℃ in an hour?
Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260 kJ/kg
Specific heat capacity = 6 KJ/Kg K
a) 21kg/hr
b) 22kg/hr
c) 20kg/hr
d) 19kg/hr
c
Hence the amount of steam needed to heat this is = 45100/2260 = 19.9 = 20 Kg
Hence the Evaporator Consumption = 20kg/hr.
5. Find the value of Evaporator Capacity if we have a feed of 30kg at 25℃ and with evaporator consumption as 10kg/hr?
Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260 kJ/kg
Specific heat capacity = 6 KJ/Kg K
a) 2kg/hr
b) 3kg/hr
c) 4kg/hr
d) 5kg/hr
c
6. What is the value of Evaporator Economy if we have a feed of 30kg at 25℃ and with evaporator consumption as 10kg/hr?
Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260 kJ/kg
Specific heat capacity = 6 KJ/Kg K
a) 42%
b) 30%
c) 40%
d) 50%
c
Hence Economy = Capacity/Consumption = (4/10) x 100 = 40%.
7. What do we mean by the term Evaporator Consumption?
a) Steam consumed in 1hr
b) Steam produced in 1hr
c) Feed supplied in 1hr
d) Feed supplied in 1day
a
8. Find one among the following which does not measure evaporator performance.
a) Steam Consumption
b) Amount of Vapour Produced
c) Economy
d) Amount of feed supplied
d
i. Steam Consumption
ii. Evaporator Capacity
iii. Evaporator Economy.
9. If the Evaporator Consumption is 10kg/hr then what should be the inlet feed rate if we wish to have a capacity if 4kg/hr?
Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260 kJ/kg
Specific heat capacity = 6 KJ/Kg K
a) 30kg
b) 32kg
c) 31kg
d) 33kg
a
10. If evaporation takes place from a 100kg feed of 50wt% solid at 25℃ in an hour and if the steam consumption is 30Kg/hr, then what is the final concentration?
Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260 kJ/kg
Specific heat capacity = 6 KJ/Kg K
a) 57
b) 56
c) 55
d) 54
b
11. The capacity of an evaporator depends upon the temperature of the feed solution.
a) True
b) False
a
12. Which one of the following method can be adopted to increase the capacity of the evaporator?
a) Increase pressure in calandria
b) Using multiple effect evaporator
c) Getting the temperature of the feed close to boiling temperature
d) Reducing the temperature of the feed
c
