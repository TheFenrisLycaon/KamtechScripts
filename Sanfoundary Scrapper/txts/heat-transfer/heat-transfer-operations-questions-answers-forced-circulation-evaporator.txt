1. What do we mean by forced convection evaporator?
a) This is nucleate boiling
b) This has a fan to remove vapour from the surface
c) There is an agitator to mix the heated fluid
d) There is an agitator to mix the heating medium such as steam
c
2. With forced convection boiling, nucleate boiling is absent which makes wall temperature very close to interface temperature.
a) True
b) False
a
3. The presence of forced convection makes the complete mixed fluid boiling pattern known as __________
a) Pool boiling
b) Surface boiling
c) Bubble boiling
d) Film boiling
a
4. The boiling that takes place in forced convection boiling is popularly known as surface boiling.
a) True
b) False
b
5. Which one of the following evaporator does not use forced boiling as its boiling operation?
a) Plate type evaporators
b) Horizontal tube evaporators
c) Vertical tube evaporators
d) Falling tube evaporators
d

6. The Residence tie in forced convection evaporators is ________ than natural convection evaporator.
a) More
b) Less
c) Same
d) Very less
a
7. Forced circulation is sometimes more suitable because of which one of the following statements?
a) It has Low pressure operations
b) The temperature can be maintained as circulation is present
c) The flow velocity in the tubes and the liquid temperature can be controlled to suit the product requirements
d) Cheaper than others
c
8. Forced convection boiling is also known as __________
a) Flash boiling
b) Nucleate boiling
c) Partial nucleate boiling
d) Bubble boiling
a
9. Which one of the following is not an advantage of forced convection boiling?
a) High heat transfer coefficient
b) Positive circulation
c) Very cheap to operate
d) Low fouling or scaling
c
i. High heat-transfer coefficients
ii. Positive circulation
iii. Reduced fouling or scaling.
Because of these high boiling ratio and extra circulation, the operation cost increases due to the electrical cost of running the agitator and pump, hence it is not usually cheap.
10. Which one of the following is not a demerit of forced circulation evaporator?
a) High operation cost
b) Power consumption for pumps
c) High residence time
d) High temperatures of operation
d
i. Possibly higher cost
ii. Power consumption for the circulating pump
iii. A longer holdup of the product within the heating zone
Whereas the high temperature of operation is a merit as it leads to flash boiling.
11. Forced circulation evaporators are highly suited for ________
a) High corrosive fluids
b) Fouling fluids that usually scale
c) Thin fluids
d) Highly volatile fluids
b
12. Why is forced convection evaporation also known as flash evaporation?
a) Because heat is supplied in a flash
b) Boiling the fluid in high pressure operation then exposing to low pressure
c) Total evaporation takes place in a flash
d) Very large temperature created
b
