c) The liquid vapour pressure is more than normal
d) The liquid vapour pressure is equal to normal
a
PK=PO exp ⁡\([-\frac{2\sigma v}{d_p RT}] \) Signifies that the liquid-vapour pressure is less than the normal.
7. Which one of the following equation correctly represents the lowering in vapour pressure due to capillaries?
a) PK=PO exp⁡\([\frac{2\sigma v}{d_p RT}] \) 
b) PK=PO exp⁡⁡\([-\frac{\sigma v}{d_p RT}] \) 
c) PK=PO exp⁡⁡\([-\frac{2\sigma v}{d_p RT}] \) 
d) PK=PO exp⁡\([-\frac{2\sigma v}{d_p R}] \) 
c
PK=PO exp⁡⁡\([-\frac{2\sigma v}{d_p RT}] \)
8. What is the term PO in the Kelvin equation given below?
a) PO is the superheated vapour pressure
b) PO is the saturation vapour pressure
c) PO is the sub-cooled vapour pressure
d) PO is the elevated vapour pressure
b
PK=PO exp⁡⁡\([-\frac{2\sigma v}{d_p RT}] \) 
Where, PK is the capillary-vapour pressure, PO is the saturation vapour pressure, σ is the surface tension, ν is the molar liquid volume and dp is the capillary diameter.
9. If given the surface tension of water as 73×10-3 N/m and diameter of capillary as 1mm, calculate the ratio of capillary-vapour pressure of water in this solid to the saturation vapour pressure at 25℃.
a) 99.8%
b) 90%
c) 98%
d) 97%
a
PK=POexp⁡⁡\([-\frac{2\sigma v}{d_p RT}] \)
Where, PK is the capillary-vapour pressure, PO is the saturation vapour pressure, σ is the surface tension, ν is the molar liquid volume and dp is the capillary diameter.
⁡⁡\(\frac{P_K}{P_O}=exp[-\frac{2\sigma v}{d_p RT}] = exp[-\frac{2x73x10^{-3}x22.4×10^{-3}}{8.314x298x10^{-3}}]\)=0.998.
10. What is the term V in the Kelvin equation?
a) Molar liquid volume
b) Molal liquid volume
c) Mole fraction of liquid
d) Normal liquid volume
a
PK=PO exp⁡⁡\([-\frac{2\sigma v}{d_p RT}] \) 
Where, PK is the capillary-vapour pressure, PO is the saturation vapour pressure, \(\sigma\) is the surface tension, ν is the molar liquid volume and dp is the capillary diameter.
