b
7. The multiple effect evaporators usually use __________ system of evaporation.
a) Flash
b) Natural convection
c) Forced convection
d) Bubble boiling
a
8. The vapours entering into the steam chest of respective effects of a multiple effect evaporator are at their saturation temperature.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Which one of the following is not an assumption in multiple effect evaporator’s calculations?
a) There is no sub cooling of the condensate from different steam chests
b) Heat transfer surface does not undergo fouling
c) The entering steam is at their boiling point
d) Pressure is same in every effect
d
The vapours entering in to steam shell of respective effects are at their saturation temperature
There is no sub cooling of the condensate from different steam chests
Condensation of vapour in steam chest occurs at constant pressure
There is no carry-over of liquid droplets with vapours leaving the respective effects.
There is no heat dissipation to surroundings
Heat transfer surface does not undergo fouling.
