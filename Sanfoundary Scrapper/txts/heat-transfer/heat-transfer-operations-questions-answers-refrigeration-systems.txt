a) True
b) False
a
2. Which one of the following zone breaks can be correct regarded as valid for calculations?
a)  
b)  
c)  
d)  
a
Hence the correct option is the one with all the zones having nearly linear curves.
3. What do we apply at these linear zones of the diagram?

b) The resistance due to the film
c) The resistance to heat transfer associated with the presence of non-condensing gases
d) The coolant heat transfer coefficient
b
	The coolant heat transfer coefficient, h
	The resistance to heat transfer due to the tube wall, 1/h
	The condensate heat transfer coefficient associated with heat transfer through a film of condensate on the tube wall, hC
	The resistance to heat transfer associated with the presence of non-condensing gases or a mixture
5. Fog formation in a condenser can occur when the temperature of the vapour-gas mixture _____________ the local saturation temperature during the condensation process.
a) Falls below
b) Goes above
c) Becomes equal to
d) Goes considerably high
a
6. Condensers and evaporators together form a ____________
a) Heat Exchanger
b) Refrigeration system
c) Thermocouple
d) Heating System
b
	To evaporate a refrigerant liquid in evaporator to pull in heat 
	Condense the refrigerant in a condenser to release that heat
7. What does the following diagram represent?
a) Gas Cycle
b) Refrigeration cycle
c) Automobile engine cycle
d) 4stroke cycle
b
	To evaporate a refrigerant liquid in evaporator to pull in heat
