a) True
b) False
a
4. Which one of the following is the most common mode of operation of single effect evaporators?
a) Batch
b) Semi-Batch
c) Continuous batch
d) Continuous
c
5. What is amount of heat that needs to be supplied in order to evaporate 10kg of water from a feed of 50kg at a temperature of 25℃ to a final temperature of 100℃?
Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260 kJ/kg
Specific heat capacity = 6 KJ/Kg K
a) 52600 KJ
b) 56200 KJ
c) 2272.6 MJ
d) 45100 KJ
d
6. What is mass of Steam that needs to be supplied in order to heat the tubes and evaporate 10kg of water from a feed of 50kg at a temperature of 25℃ to a final temperature of 100℃?
Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260 kJ/kg
Specific heat capacity = 6 KJ/Kg K
a) 21kg
b) 22kg
c) 20kg
d) 19kg
c
Hence the amount of steam needed to heat this is = 45100/2260 = 19.9 = 20 Kg.
7. How much evaporation can take place from a feed of 30kg at 25°C in an hour if there is constant supply of 10kg steam in that hour?
Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260 kJ/kg
Specific heat capacity = 6 KJ/Kg K
a) 2kg
b) 3kg
c) 4kg
d) 5kg
c
8. If we have a steam flow rate of 10kg/hr then what should be the inlet feed rate if we wish to evaporate 4kg of water from the dilute solution in an hour?
Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260 kJ/kg
Specific heat capacity = 6 KJ/Kg K
a) 30kg
b) 32kg
c) 31kg
d) 33kg
a
9. Increasing the pressure of the setup will result in larger evaporation rate.
a) True
b) False
b
10. If evaporation takes place from a feed of 50wt% solid at 25℃ in an hour if there is constant supply of 30kg steam per 100kg feed in that hour, then what is the final concentration?

Specific heat capacity = 6 KJ/Kg K
a) 57
b) 56
c) 55
d) 54
b
11. Which one of the following would not benefit the evaporator if employed?

b) Pressure increased
c) Surface area increased
d) Steam supply increased
b
12. If we have a feed flow rate of 30kg/hr at 25℃ then what should be the heating steam rate if we wish to evaporate 4kg of water from the dilute solution in an hour?
Latent heat of vaporization of water = 2,260 kJ/kg
Specific heat capacity = 6 KJ/Kg K
a) 10kg
b) 12kg
c) 11kg
d) 13kg
a
