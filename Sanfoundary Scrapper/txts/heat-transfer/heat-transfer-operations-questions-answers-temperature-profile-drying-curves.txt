6. What do we understand by the initial heating period of the drying curve?
a) Preheating with the feed with large evaporation rate
b) Preheating the feed but evaporation is negligible
c) Temperature rises almost linearly and evaporation too increases linearly
d) Temperature falls almost linearly and evaporation too decreases linearly
c
7. Which region is known as the Initial period of the drying curve?
a)  
b)  
c)  
d)  
a
8. In which one of the following regions the moisture is available as free moisture on the surface hence evaporation rates are high?
a) Constant rate period
b) Falling rate period
c) Rising rate period
d) Critical rate period
a
9. Which region represents that state when the water in the substance is available as free moisture?
a)  
b)  
c)  
d)  
d
10. What happens in the falling rate period?
a) The free moisture available on the surface shrinks to the core
b) The water in the substance is available as free moisture
c) The water in the substance has completely diminished
d) The water in the substance is blocked by a membrane formed
a
The unbound moisture has already been lost in the constant drying region and it is the bound moisture that does not escape leading this falling period.
11. The critical moisture content is the point in which the _____________
a) Constant rate period ends
b) Constant rate period starts
c) Falling rate period ends
d) Initial heating period starts
a
12. The feed temperature during the constant rate period _________ with time.
a) Increases
b) Remains same
c) Decreases
d) Oscillates
b
