1. Which one of the following is not an assumption taken before applying enthalpy balance on the evaporator?
a) No solid should precipitate out from the concentrating solution
b) The superheat and sub-cooling conditions of the condensable steam is negligible
c) No fouling should occur on the evaporator surface
d) Flow of non-condensable gas is negligible
c
Flow of non-condensable gas is negligible 
The superheat and sub-cooling conditions of the condensable steam is negligible 
No solid should precipitate out from the concentrating solution. 
2. The flow of vapour in an evaporator is assumed to be non-condensable else the calculations would differ for the evaporator if the gas condenses.
