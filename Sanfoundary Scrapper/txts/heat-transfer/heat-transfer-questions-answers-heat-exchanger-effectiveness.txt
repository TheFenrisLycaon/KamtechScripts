d
4. The engine oil at 150 degree Celsius is cooled to 80 degree Celsius in a parallel flow heat exchanger by water entering at 25 degree Celsius and leaving at 60 degree Celsius. Estimate the exchanger effectiveness
a) 0.56
b) 0.66
c) 0.76
d) 0.86
a
5. Consider the above problem, if the fluid flow rates and the inlet conditions remain unchanged, workout the lowest temperature to which the oil may be cooled by increasing length of the exchanger
a) 46.62 degree Celsius

c
6. In a surface condenser, the water flowing through a series of tubes at the rate of 200 kg/hr is heated from 15 degree Celsius to 75 degree Celsius. The steam condenses on the outside surface of tubes at atmospheric pressure and the overall heat transfer coefficient is estimated at 860 k J/m2 hr degree. Find the effectiveness of the heat exchanger. At the condensing pressure, stream has a saturation temperature 0f 100 degree Celsius and the latent heat of vaporization is 2160 k J/kg. Further, the steam is initially just saturated and the condensate leaves the exchanger without sub-cooling i.e. only latent heat of condensing steam is transferred to the water.
