8. In a surface condenser, the water flowing through a series of tubes at the rate of 200 kg/hr is heated from 15 degree Celsius to 75 degree Celsius. The steam condenses on the outside surface of tubes at atmospheric pressure and the overall heat transfer coefficient is estimated at 860 k J/m2 hr degree.
