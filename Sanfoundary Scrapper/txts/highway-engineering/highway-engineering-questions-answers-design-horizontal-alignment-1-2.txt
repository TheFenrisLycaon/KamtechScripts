1. The degree if curve is central angle subtended by an arc of length is?
a) 20m
b) 25m
c) 30m
d) 35m
c
2. The ratio between centrifugal force and weight of the vehicle is called ___________
a) Impact factor
b) Impact ratio
c) Centrifugal factor
d) Centrifugal impulse
a
3. Which of the following is equal to super elevation?
a) Sinθ
b) Cosθ
c) Tanθ
d) Secθ
c
4. If the radius of a horizontal curve is 120m, then calculate the safe allowable speed.
a) 50kmph
b) 60kmph
c) 70kmph
d) 80kmph
b
Va = √(27.94*120)
Va = 60kmph.
5. If the super elevation of the highway provided is zero, then the design speed of highway having a curve of 200m and coefficient of friction 0.10 is?
a) 40kmph
b) 50kmph
c) 55kmph
d) 60kmph
b
V=√127×200×0.1
V=50Kmph.
6. The design speed on a highway is 60kmph; calculate the super elevation if radius of curve is 150m and coefficient of friction is 0.15.
a) 0.07
b) 0.038
c) 0.04
d) 0.15
b
e+f=3600/(127*150)
e+f=0.188
e=0.188-0.15
e=0.038.
7. The super elevation is calculated for ___________
a) 75% of design speed including friction
b) 80% of design speed neglecting friction
c) 75% of design speed neglecting friction
d) 80% of design speed including friction
c

a) 0.47m
b) 0.48m
c) 0.49m
d) 0.50m
c
E=Be,
E=7*0.07=0.49m 
9. The ruling minimum radius in the curve is given by ___________
a) R=V2/127(e+f)
b) R=V’2/127 (e+f)
c) R=127(e+f)
d) R=127/(e+f)
b
10. The extra widening is the sum of ___________
a) Mechanical widening and psychological widening
b) Two times of mechanical widening
c) Two times of psychological widening
d) Mechanical widening – physical widening
a
