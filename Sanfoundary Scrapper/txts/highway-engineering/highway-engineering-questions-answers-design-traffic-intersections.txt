c
9. In India the design velocity at rotary is considered as __________
a) 30kmph
b) 40kmph
c) 50kmph
d) 60kmph
b
10. If the coefficient of friction is 0.43, and the design velocity is 40kmph then the radius of curve is?
a) 20m
b) 25m
c) 28m
d) 30m
d
R=V2/127f
R=40*40/ (127*0.43)
R=30m. 
11. The minimum radius for rotary recommended by IRC is?
a) 1.3 times of entry radius
b) 1.33 times of entry radius
c) 1.5 times of entry radius
d) 1.7 times of entry radius
b
12. If the average width of the entry section is 3m and the exit is 6m then the average width is?
a) 4m
b) 4.5m
c) 5.0m
d) 5.5m
b
=3+6/2
=4.5m. 
13. The PCU value near rotary is highest for __________
a) Cars
b) Bus
c) Cycle
d) Animal drawn vehicles
d
14. In a traffic lane the traffic moving extreme left is 250 PCU and in extreme right it is 240 PCU, the sum of the weaving traffic crossing left and right is 500 PCU, find proportion of weaving traffic.
a) 0.5
b) 1.5
c) 2.5
d) 3.0
a
P=b + c/ (a + b + c+ d)
P=500/ (250+500+240)
P=0.5.

a) 1088 PCU
b) 1100PCU
c) 1200 PCU
d) 1300PCU
a
Q=280*12*[1+0.4/12][1-0.5/3]/(1+12/7.2)
Q=1088PCU.
