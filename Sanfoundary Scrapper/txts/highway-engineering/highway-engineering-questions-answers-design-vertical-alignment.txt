1. The vertical alignment of a highway includes?
a) Sight distance and traffic intersection
b) Widening of pavements
c) Design of valley curves and gradients
d) Highway lighting
c
2. The ruling gradient required for plain or rolling terrain is ___________
a) 1 in 15
b) 1 in 20
c) 1 in 30
d) 1 in 40
c
3. The maximum grade compensation for a curve of radius 75m is?
a) 1%
b) 1.4%
c) 1.5%
d) 1.6%
a
4. The vertical alignment does not influence?
a) Sight distance
b) Vehicle operation cost
c) Accidents
d) Vehicle speed
c
5. The angle which is measured at the change of direction of two gradients is called ___________
a) Standard angle
b) Subtended angle
c) Deviation angle
d) Setback angle
c
6. The length of the summit curve is based on ___________
a) Comfort
b) Sight distance
c) Convexity
d) Deviation angle
b
7. The value of “a” in the equation y=ax2 used in the summit curve is ___________
a) N/2L
b) N/3L
c) N/4L
d) N/5L
a
8. If the length of the summit curve having SSD as 150m and deviation angle is 1 in 30 is ___________
a) 50m
b) 100m
c) 150m
d) 170m
a
L=NS2/4.4
L=1*150*150/ (4.4*30)
L=170m. 
9. If the deviation angle of the curve is 1/200 and the design speed is 80kmph then calculate the total length of the valley curve for comfort condition.
a) 18.22
b) 18.52
c) 19.22m
d) 19.52m
c
=0.38(1/200*803)0.5
=19.22m.
