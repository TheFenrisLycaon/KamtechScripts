1. The mechanical widening of a track is given by ___________
a) l2/2R
b) nl2/2R
c) nl3/2R
d) nl/2R
b
2. The length of wheel base usually considered in India is?
a) 6.1m
b) 5.9m
c) 5.8m
d) 5.5m
a
3. The total off tracking of a vehicle having wheel base length as 6.1m and radius of curve 120m is?
a) 0.150
b) 0.151
c) 0.153
d) 0.155
d
=6.1*6.1/(2*120)
=0.155.
4. The extra width required on two lane pavement for a radius of curve 100m as recommended by IRC is ___________
a) 0.6m
b) 0.7m
c) 0.8m
d) 0.9m
d
5. The mechanical widening of a curve is 1.5m, the curve is having a radius of 120m and design speed as 80kmph find the total widening on the curve.
a) 2.20m
b) 2.26m
c) 2.25m
d) 2.24m
b
Extra width required=1.5m + V/9.5√R
=1.5 + 80/9.5 √120
=2.26m.
6. The most preferred type of transition curve by IRC for highway is ___________
a) Spiral
b) Cubic parabola
c) Parabola
d) Lemniscate
c
7. The minimum value of change of centrifugal acceleration is ___________
a) 0.4m/sec3
b) 0.5m/sec3
c) 0.6m/sec3
d) 0.7m/sec3
b
8. The rate of change of acceleration in m/sec3 for a design speed of 85kmph is ___________
a) 0.5
b) 0.6
c) 0.7
d) 0.8
a
C=80/(75+V)
C=80/(75+85)
C=0.5m/sec3.
9. In a steep terrain the radius of curve is 100m and the design speed is 80kmph then the length of transition curve will be ___________
a) 44m
b) 54m
c) 64m
d) 74m
c
Ls=80*80/100
Ls=64m.
10. The total shift of a transition curve is ___________
a) L2/12R
b) L2/24R
c) L2/48R
d) L2/96R
b
