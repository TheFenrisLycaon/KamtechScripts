1. The braking efficiency mainly depends on ___________
a) Sight distance
b) PIEV theory
c) Friction
d) Length of the curve
c
2. The braking efficiency for a vehicle moving with a speed of 18kmph, having a lag distance of 14m and coefficient of longitudinal friction is 0.36.
a) 25.28%
b) 25.4%
c) 25.6%
d) 25.8%
a
f’=v2/2gL
f’=5*5/2*9.81*14
f’=0.09
=100*0.09/0.36
=25.28%.
3. If the longitude coefficient of friction is 0.4, then the resultant retardation in m/sec2 as per IRC will be ___________
a) 3.93
b) 4.00
c) 4.01
d) 4.02
a
4. The unevenness index for a good pavement surface of high speed should be ___________
a) 1500mm/km
b) 2500mm/km
c) 3500mm/km
d) 4500mm/km
a
5. If the camber is x%, then cross slope is ___________
a) 100X
b) 200/X
c) X/100
d) 100+X
c
6. The camber required depends on ___________
a) Type of pavement
b) Rainfall
c) Type of pavement and rainfall
d) Rainfall characteristics
c
7. The minimum camber required in heavy rainfall area for bituminous roads as per IRC is ___________
a) 1%
b) 2.5%
c) 2.7%
d) 3%
b
8. The camber is not provided in which of the following shape?
a) Straight
b) Parabolic
c) Combination of straight and parabolic
d) Circular
d
9. The rise of crown for pavement of 7m wide having 1 in 50 slopes with respect to edges is ___________
a) 0.14
b) 0.07
c) 0.09
d) 0.11
b
Rise of crown=7/2*1/50=7/100=0.07.
10. The equation of parabolic camber is given by ___________
a) Y=x/a
b) Y=x2/a
c) Y=x3/a
d) Y=ax2
b
