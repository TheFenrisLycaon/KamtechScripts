1. The length visible to driver at any instance of time is called ___________
a) Sight distance
b) Visibility limit
c) Head light distance
d) Overtaking sight distance
a
2. The stopping sight distance of a vehicle moving with 45kmph and having a coefficient of friction as 0.4 is?
a) 48m
b) 49m
c) 50m
d) 51m
d
SSD=0.278*45*2.5+452/(254*0.4)
SSD=51m.
3. The stopping sight distance does not depend on ___________
a)  Break reaction time
b) Speed of vehicle
c) Length of vehicle
d) Friction
c
In this equation t is the reaction time taken by driver for stopping the vehicle, v is the speed of the vehicle and f is the coefficient of friction, so the SSD is independent of the length of the vehicle.
4. The SSD is based on ___________
a) Speed of vehicle
b) PIEV theory
c) Voluntary action of brain
d) Reflex action of brain
b
5. The reaction time considered in SSD is ___________
a) 1.5 sec
b) 2 sec
c) 2.5 sec
d) 3 sec
c
6. The desirable relationship between OSD and length of overtaking zone is ___________
a) Length of overtaking zone = OSD
b) Length of overtaking zone = 2 OSD
c) Length of overtaking zone = 3 OSD
d) Length of overtaking zone = 5 OSD
d
7. If the speed of overtaken vehicle is 80Kmph, then the design speed is ___________
a) 80kmph
b) 96kmph
c) 100kmph
d) 106kmph
c
V=Vb+16
V=80+16=96Kmph.
8. If the speed of overtaken vehicle is 50kmph then spacing of vehicles is ___________
a) 10m
b) 12m
c) 14m
d) 16m
d
S=0.2*50+6
S=16m.
9. The reaction time of a driver assumed in OSD is ___________
a) 1 sec
b) 2 sec
c) 2.5sec
d) 3 sec
b
10. The height of the driver above the road level is assumed as ___________
a) 1.1m
b) 1.2 m
c) 1.5 m
d) 1.6m
b
11. The relationship between SSD and ISD is?
a) SSD = ISD
b) SSD = 1.5 SSD
c) SSD = ISD + OSD
d) SSD = 2 ISD
d
12. The sight distance recommended by IRC for 50kmph speed is?
a) 100m
b) 110m
c) 120m
d) 200m
b
