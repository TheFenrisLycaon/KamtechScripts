b
4. The clearance time for amber is usually __________
a) 0.5sec
b) 1sec
c) 1.5sec

d
5. In trial cycle method, the average time headway is assumed as __________
a) 2sec
b) 2.5sec
c) 3sec
d) 3.5sec
b
6. The number of cycles for a trial period of 45 sec is?
a) 20
b) 22
c) 25
d) 30
a
=20.
7. If the number of cycles in trial cycle method is 20, for traffic of 170 on one road and 160 on other road, then calculate the total green time in sec.
a) 38
b) 39
c) 40
d) 41
d
=21.25
Green time on 2nd road=160*2.5/20
=20
Total green time=41 sec.

d) 7sec
d
9. There is a traffic flow of 250 vehicles on road A and 200 vehicles on road B, if the green signal time on road A is 15 sec, then the green signal time of road B is?
a) 10sec
b) 11sec
c) 12sec
d) 13sec
b
Ga/Gb=na/nb
Ga/Gb=250/200
Gb=12sec. 
10. If the amber time at a signal is 3 sec and the green signal time is 25sec, find the red signal time?
a) 22sec
b) 21sec
c) 28sec
d) 29sec
c
11. Which of the traffic signal method is based on saturation flow?
a) Trial cycle method
b) Webster method
c) IRC method
d) Approximate method
b
12. On a 2 phase road, the saturation flow on road A is 1000 and normal flow is 250,whereas on road B the saturation flow is 1500 and normal flow is 500,the total red time is 10 sec, find optimum cycle length.
a) 35sec
b) 36sec
c) 37sec
d) 38sec
c
Yb=500/1500=0.3
Y=Ya+Yb=0.7
C0=1.5*L+5/ (1-Y)
C0=1.5*14+5/ (1-0.7)
C0=87sec.
