1. The difference in between the set of front axle and rear axle while negotiating a horizontal curve is called ___________
a) Psychological widening
b) Off tracking
c) Skidding
d) Slipping
b
2. A wheel base of 6.5m negotiates a 35m curve find the off tracking?
a) 0.5m
b) 0.6m
c) 0.62m
d) 0.7m
b
=6.5*6.5/70
=0.6m.
3. In a braking test, a vehicle was moving with a speed of 45kmph and was stopped by applying brakes, the skid marks were 10.0m in length. Determine the skid resistance.
a) 0.78m
b) 0.69m
c) 0.71m
d) 0.72m
a
=12.5m/sec
Braking distance = u2/2gf
10=12.5*12.5/ (2*9.81*f)
F=0.78m. 
4. The brake efficiency in the braking test is assumed as ___________
a) 95%
b) 96%
c) 99%
d) 100%
d
5. Gross weight, axle and wheel loads of vehicle govern the ___________
a) Width of pavement
b) Thickness of pavement
c) Structural design of pavement and cross drainage structures
d) Traffic junctions
c
6. How many types of factors affect traffic characteristics?
a) One
b) Two
c) Three
d) Four
d
7. The hearing, visibility and reaction time are covered in which type of factors?
a) Physical
b) Mental
c) Psychological
d) Environmental
a
8. An intelligent driver who consumed alcohol will have a chance of ___________
a) Increased alertness
b) Increase in reaction time
c) Increase in speed
d) Increase in judgment
b
9. The pollutant mostly released by automobiles is ___________
a) CO
b) CO2
c) O3
d) CH4
a
10. The most likely cause of accidents is ___________
a) Impatience in driving
b) Slow speed of vehicle
c) Pedestrians crossing the road
d) Cattle crossing the road
a
11. The width recommended by IRC for all type of vehicles is ___________
a) 1.5m
b) 2.0m
c) 2.5m
d) 3.0m
c
12. The stability of a vehicle is influenced by ___________
a) Width of wheel base only
b) Width of wheel base and height of gravity
c) Height of gravity only
d) Length of vehicle only
b
13. The height of the vehicle mainly influences?
a) Width of pavement
b) Length of curve
c) Clearance under structures
d) Design velocity
c
14. The minimum number of parameters needed to measure brake efficiency is?
a) One
b) Two
c) Three
d) Four
b
15. If the acceleration of the vehicle is 6.17m/sec2 then the average skid resistance is?
a) 0.61
b) 0.62
c) 0.63
d) 0.64
b
f=6.17/9.81
=0.63.
