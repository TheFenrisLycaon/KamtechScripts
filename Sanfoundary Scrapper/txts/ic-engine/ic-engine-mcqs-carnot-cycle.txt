1. In a carnot cycle, the working medium receives heat at a _____________ temperature.
a) lower
b) higher
c) constant
d) none of the mentioned
b
2. In a carnot cycle, the working medium rejects heat at a ____________ temperature.
a) lower
b) higher
c) constant
d) none of the mentioned
a
3. In a carnot cycle, what is the working fluid?
a) a real gas
b) an ideal gas
c) a natural gas
d) none of the mentioned
b
4. The isothermal process of a carnot cycle needs very __________ motion of the piston to maintain constant temperature.
a) slow
b) fast
c) medium
d) none of the mentioned
a
5. The adiabatic process of a carnot cycle needs very __________ motion to complete the adiabatic process.
a) slow
b) fast
c) medium
d) none of the mentioned
b
6. For a given temperature T1, as the difference between T1 and T2 increases, the COP of a carnot heat pump ___________
a) increases
b) decreases
c) first increases, then decreases
d) none of the mentioned
b
As the value of T1 – T2 increases, value of COP decreases. 
7. A carnot heat pump is used to heat a house. The outside temperature is -3ºC and the indoor temperature is 27ºC. If the heat loss from the house is 40kW, the power required to operate the heat pump is?
a) 1kW
b) 2kW
c) 3kW
d) 4kW
d
or,   40/ Work done = 273 + 27/27-(-3)
or,    Work done = 40 x 30/300 = 4kW.
8. A carnot cycle is to be designed to attain efficiency of 0.75. if temperature of high temperature reservoir is 727ºC, then low temperature reservoir will have to be maintained at ___________
a) 23ºC
b) 181ºC
c) -23ºC
d) -181ºC
c
or,    0.75 = 727- T1/(727+273)
or,     0.75×1000 = 727- T1
or,     – T1 = 750-727
or,       T1 = -23ºC.
9. A cyclic heat engine does 50kJ of  work per cycle. If efficiency of engine is 75%, the heat rejected per cycle will be ___________
a) 60.6kJ
b) 16.6kJ
c) 66.6kJ
d) 200kJ
b
				    0.75   = 50/ Q1
or,                         Q1 = 200/3
and,     Work done = Q1– Q2
or,       Q2 = 200/3-50     = 50/3 = 16.6kJ.
10. A carnot cycle refrigerator operates between 250ºK and 300ºK. What is the value of COP?
a) 10
b) 20
c) 25
d) 5
d
			    = 250/300-250
			    = 5.
