d) none of the mentioned
b
2. The power developed by an engine at the output shaft is called ____________

c) mean effective pressure
d) none of the mentioned
a
3. The hypothetical pressure which is thought to be acting on the piston throughout the power stroke is called ____________

4. A 4-cylinder four stroke petrol engine develops 14.7 KW at 1000 r.p.m. The mean effective pressure is 5.5 bar. Calculate the bore and stroke of the engine, if the length of stroke is 1.5 times the bore.
a) 87.9 mm and 131.8 mm
b) 90 mm and 134 mm
c) 97.4 mm and 138 mm
d) none of the mentioned
a
             Power developed, P = 14.7 kW
             Engine speed, N = 1000 r.p.m.
             Indicated mean effective pressure, Pmi = 5.5 bar
             Length of stroke, L = 1.5D (bore)
             For four stroke cycle, k = 1/2
Indicated power developed, I.P. = (nPmiLANk x 10)/6 kw
                                        14.7 = (4 x 5.5 x 1.5D x (pi/4 x D2)x 1000 x 1/2 x 10)/6
                    therefore, D3 = 0.0006806
                    or,  D = 0.0879 or 87.9 mm
           and L = 1.5 x 87.9 = 131.8 mm.
5. A single cylinder, four stroke cycle oil engine is fitted with a rope brake. The diameter of the brake wheel is 600 mm and the rope diameter is 26 mm. The dead load on the brake is 200 N and the spring balance reads 30 N. If the engine runs at 450 r.p.m., what will be the brake power of the engine?
a) 2 kW
b) 2.5 kW
c) 3 kW
d) 3.5 kW
b
             Rope diameter, d = 26 mm = 0.026 m
             Dead load on the brake, W = 200 N
             Spring balance reading, S = 30 N
             Engine speed, N = 450 r.p.m.
             Brake Power, B.P. = ((W – S)pi(Db + d)N)/60 x 1000
                               = ((200 – 30)pi(0.6 + 0.026) x 450)/60 x 1000
                               = 2.5 kW.
6. The brake output per unit of piston displacement is defined as brake power.
a) True
b) False
b
7. What are the types of absorption dynamo meters?
a) prony brake
b) rope brake
c) hydraulic brake
d) all of the mentioned
d
i) prony brake
ii) rope brake
iii) hydraulic brake
iv) fan brake
v) electrical brake dynamo meters.
8. Transmission dynamo meters are also known as ____________
a) rope brake
b) hydraulic brake
c) torque meters
d) none of the mentioned
c
9. The brake power is the power available ____________
a) in the engine cylinder
b) at the crank shaft
c) at the crank pin
d) none of the mentioned
b
10. The frictional power (F.P) is given by ____________
a) F.P. = B.P.-I.P.
b) F.P. = I.P.-B.P.
c) F.P. = B.P./I.P.
d) F.P. = I.P./B.P.
b
                                F.P  = I.P.-B.P.
