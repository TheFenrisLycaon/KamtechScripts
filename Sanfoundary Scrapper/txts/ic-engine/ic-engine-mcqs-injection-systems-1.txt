11. A six cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine develops 125 kW at 3000 rpm. Its brake specific fuel consumption is 200gm/kW h. Calculate the quantity of fuel to be injected per cycle per cylinder. Specific gravity of the fuel may be taken as 0.85.
a) 0.0545 cc/cycle
b) 0.545 cc/ cycle
c) 5.45 cc/cycle
d) none of the mentioned
a
                                = 200 x 10-2 x 125 = 25 kg
             Fuel consumption/cylinder = 25/6 = 4.17 kg/h
             Fuel consumption/cycle = (Fuel consumption/minute)/n
             where n = N/2 for four-stroke cycle engines = (4.17/60)/(3000/2)
                                                         = 4.63 x 10-5 kg
                                                         = 0.0463 gm
             Volume of fuel injected = 0.0463/0.85
                                     = 0.0545 cc/cycle.
