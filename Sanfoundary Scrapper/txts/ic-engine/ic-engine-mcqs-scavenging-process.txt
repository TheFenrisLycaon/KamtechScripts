1. The process of clearing the cylinder after the expansion stroke is called scavenging process.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Scavenging process is the replacement of combustion products in the cylinder from the previous power stroke with fresh air charge to be burned in the next cycle.
a) True
b) False
a
3. The efficiency of a two stroke engine does not depend on the effectiveness of the scavenging process.
a) True
b) False
b
4. Inadequate scavenging leads to high mean indicated pressure which results in high weight and high cost per kW for the engine.
a) True
b) False
b
5. Inadequate scavenging leads to a low amount of oxygen availability which results in incomplete combustion leading to higher specific fuel combustion.
a) True
b) False
a
6. Inadequate scavenging leads to contamination of lubricating oil to a greater extent which reduces the lubricating qualities and eventually results in increased wear of piston and cylinder liners.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Scavenging angle is the crank angle during which both inlet and exhaust port are open.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Scavenging period is the time period taken for crank angle.
a) True
b) False
b
9. Which of the following are the theoretical scavenging processes?
a) perfect scavenging
b) perfect mixing
c) short circuiting
d) all of the mentioned
d
i) perfect scavenging
ii) perfect mixing
iii) short circuiting.
10. In short circuiting process, the fresh charge coming from the scavenge manifold directly goes out of the exhaust ports without removing combustion products.
a) True
b) False
a
