3. The supercharged petrol engines have a lower fuel consumption than naturally aspirated engines.
a) True
b) False
b
4. Increased intake pressure and temperature reduces ignition delay and decreases flame speed.
a) True
b) False
b
5. The increased flame speeds make the petrol engine more sensitive to fuel-air ratio and engine cannot run on strong mixtures without knock.
a) True
b) False
b

a) True
b) False
b
8. The ignition must be retarded at high intake pressure and temperature.
a) True
b) False
a
9. The power developed by the turbocharger is not sufficient to drive the compressor, and overcome its mechanical friction.
a) True
b) False
b
10. The loss in piston work due to the early opening of the exhaust valve is less than offset by better charging and scavenging of the engine.
a) True
b) False
b
