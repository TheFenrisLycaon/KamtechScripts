b) Measurement of length of arm
c) Measurement of force and length of arm
d) Measurement of velocity of material
c
7. Which of the following represents the correct relationship between angular displacement and torque?
a) Direct proportionality
b) Inverse proportionality
c) Equal magnitude
d) None of the mentioned
a
8. Torque can be measured using surface shear strains.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Which of the following represents the correct position of strain gauges in torque measurement?
a) 900 with each other
b) Parallel to shaft axis
c) Perpendicular to shaft axis
d) 450 from shaft axis
d
10. A torsion bar of constant inner radius and length is applied with constant torque. What will happen for the angular displacement if outer radius of torsion bar is increased?
a) Increase
b) Decreases
c) Doubles
d) Halved
b
			   ɸ = 2LT/πG(R04 – Ri4)
keeping all other factors constant, angular displacement and outer radius become inverse portioned to each other.
