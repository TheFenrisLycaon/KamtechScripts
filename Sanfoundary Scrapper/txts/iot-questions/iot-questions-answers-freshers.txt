a) True
b) False
a
3. We use any other frequency source other than crystal oscillator.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Reset work is __________
a) To make program counter zero but values in registers values are made as zero
b) Program counter is not zero but values in registers values are made as
Zero
c) Program counter not zero but values in registers values remain same
d) To make program counter zero but values in registers values remain same
d
5. What is the minimum no of cycles required for reset operation?
a) 3 cycle
b) 2 cycles
c) 1 cycles
d) 4 cycles
c
6. PSEN stands for ________
a) Program Select Enable
b) Peripheral Store Enable
c) Program Store Enable
d) Peripheral Select Enable
c
7. Find the machine cycle for AT89C51 if XTAL = 11.0592MHz.
a) 90.42us
b) 361.68us
c) 1.085us
d) 150.145us
b
          Time = 1/frequency
          Time(ns) = 1/11.0592MHz
                 = 90.42ns
          Machine cycles = 12*90.42
                       = 1.085us.

c) 8-bit auto reload mode, 8-bit auto reload time/counter; THx holds a value which is to be reloaded into TLx each time it overflows
d) Spilt timer mode
a
9. What is the operation for mode 1?
a) 13-bit timer mode, 8-bit timer/counter THx and TLx as 5-bit prescalar
b) 16-bit timer mode, 16-bit timer/counter THx and TLx are cascaded, no prescalar
c) 8-bit auto reload mode, 8-bit auto reload time/counter; THx holds a value which is to be reloaded into TLx each time it overflows
d) Spilt timer mode
b
10. Which is the operation for mode 2?
a) 13-bit timer mode, 8-bit timer/counter THx and TLx as 5-bit prescalar
b) 16-bit timer mode, 16-bit timer/counter THx and TLx are cascaded, no prescalar
c) 8-bit auto reload mode, 8-bit auto reload time/counter; THx holds a value which is to be reloaded into TLx each time it overflows
d) Spilt timer mode
c
11. Which is the operation for mode 3?

c) 8-bit auto reload mode, 8-bit auto reload time/counter; THx holds a value which is to be reloaded into TLx each time it overflows
d) Spilt timer mode
d
12. Function of IE1 in TCON register?
a) External interrupt 1 Edge flag. Not related to timer operations
b) External interrupt 1 Edge flag. Not related to timer operations
c) External interrupt 0 single type control bit
d) External interrupt 1 to be triggered by a falling edge signal
a
