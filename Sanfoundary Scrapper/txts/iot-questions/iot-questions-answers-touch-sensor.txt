1. surface capacitive sensing
2. Projected capacitive sensing
In surface capacitive sensing, an insulator is applied with a conductive coating on one side of its surface.
In projected capacitive sensing, the whole surface is not changed, but an X-Y grid conductive material is placed between two insulating materials.
