1. What are the functions of the transport layer?
a) Multiplexing/ Demultiplexing
b) Connection less Services
c) Connection oriented service
d) Congestion control
a
–>	Multiplexing / DE multiplexing : Normally the transport layer will create distinct network connection for each transport connection required by the session layer.
–>	Fragmentation and Re assembly: The data accepted by the transport layer from the session layer is split up into smaller units if needed and then passed to the network layer.
