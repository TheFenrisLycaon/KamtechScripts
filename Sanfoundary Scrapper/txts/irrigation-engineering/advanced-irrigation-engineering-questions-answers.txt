1. The vertical component of the earthquake wave which produces adverse effects on the stability of a dam when is acting in ____________________
a) upward direction
b) downward direction
c) both upward and downward direction
d) any direction
b
2. The horizontal component of an earthquake wave producing instability in a dam is the one which acts __________________
a) towards the reservoir
b) towards the dam
c) away from the reservoir
d) away from the dam
a
3. The vertical downward earthquake acceleration av = 0.1g acting on a gravity dam will ________________________
a) increase the resisting weight of the dam by 10%
b) decrease the resisting weight of the dam by 10%
c) increase the uplift by 10%
d) decrease the uplift by 10%
b
where W is the total weight of the dam and Kv is the fraction of gravity adopted for vertical acceleration.
This is considered as the worst case for design as the foundation tries to move downward away from the dam body when there is downward vertical acceleration. This reduces the effective weight and the stability of the dam.
4. A gravity dam is subjected to hydrodynamic pressure caused by __________
a) the rising waves of the reservoir when a flood wave enters into it
b) the rising waves in the reservoir due to high winds
c) the increase in water pressure momentarily caused by the horizontal earthquake acting towards the reservoir
d) the increase in water pressure momentarily caused by the horizontal earthquake acting towards the dam
c
5. In a concrete gravity dam with a vertical upstream face the stabilising force is provided by the ___________________
a) weight of the dam
b) the water supported against the upstream slope
c) uplift pressure
d) water pressure at the tail end
a
6. What is the value of horizontal destabilizing force caused by the formation of waves in a storage reservoir having a fetch of 52 km due to high wind of 172 km/h?
a) 30 KN
b) 60 KN
c) 130 KN
d) 180 KN
d
hw = 0.032 (172 x 52)1/2 = 3.02 m
The force caused by waves is given by the equation – Pw = 19.62 hw2 KN/m run of the dam
Pw = 19.62 x 3.022 = 179.69 KN.
7. Calculate the value of free-board that should be provided for a reservoir having a wind velocity of 92 km/h and it extends up to 18 km upstream.
a) 1.2 m
b) 1.6 m
c) 2.25 m
d) 2.5 m
c
Hw = 0.032(92 x 18)1/2 + 0.763 – 0.271 (18)1/4 = 1.5 m
Free board is generally provided equal to 1.5 Hw = 1.5 x 1.5 = 2.25 m.
8. The upward acceleration of dam due to seismic activity will ________________________
a) increase the base pressure
b) decrease the base pressure
c) not affect the effective weight of the dam
d) increase the horizontal dynamic force
a
9. What is the average value of acceleration that is sufficient for high dams in seismic zones?
a) 0.1g to 0.15g
b) 0.05g to 0.1g
c) 0.3gs
d) 0.15g (where g is the acceleration due to gravity)
a
10. What is Von Karman’s formula for hydrodynamic force (Pe)?
a) Pe = 0.726 pe H
b) Pe = 0.424 pe H
c) Pe = 0.555 pe H
d) Pe = 0.555.Kh. Yw H2
d
Pe = 0.555. Kh. ϒw H2 where, ϒw is the unit weight of water, H is the depth of water and Kh is a fraction of gravity adapted for horizontal acceleration which acts at the height of 4H/3π above the base. In addition to this, an inertia force is also produced by the horizontal acceleration into the body of the dam.
