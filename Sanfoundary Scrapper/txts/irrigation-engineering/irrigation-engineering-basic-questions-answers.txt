1. In what intervals the top width of the notch lies?
a) 1/2 to full water depth
b) 3/4 to full water depth
c) Full water depth
d) 1/4 to full water depth
b
2. By what value the thickness of notch pier should not be less than the water depth?
a) One fourth of water depth
b) Equal to water depth
c) Half the water depth
d) Three fourth of the water depth
c
3. The length of the weir will not exceed the bed width of the canal upstream, in case of trapezoidal notch fall.
a) True
b) False
a
4. In case of design of sarda type fall the length of crest is kept equal to ____________
a) thickness of the Canal
b) bed Width of the Canal
c) water Depth in the Canal
d) hydraulic Jump on the fall
b
5. In case of designing a sarda type fall the shape of the crest has one boundary level.
a) False
b) True
b
6. What is formula used to determine the crest level while designing a sarda type fall?
a) Q = Cd x \(\sqrt{2g}\) x L x H3/2 x (H/Bt)1/6
b) Q = Cd x \(\sqrt{2g}\) x L x H3/4 x (H/Bt)1/4
c) Q = Cd x \(\sqrt{2g}\) x L x H1/4 x (H/Bt)1/8
d) Q = Cd x \(\sqrt{2g}\) x L x H x (H/Bt)1/6
a
Q = Cd x \(\sqrt{2g}\) x L x H3/2 x (H/Bt)1/6, where Cd = 0.415 for rectangular crest and 0.45 for trapezoidal crest, L = length of crest, Bt = Top width of crest, height of crest above bed = y – H, y = normal depth of channel.
7. What is the height of the baffle wall in case of designing inglis fall?
a) hb = yc
b) hb = y – y1
c) hb = y1
d) hb = yc – y1
d
Thickness of the baffle wall is 2/3hb and length of baffle wall is 5.25hb.
8. What type of design does the figure represent?
a) Single vertical drop fall
b) Sarda Type Fall
c) Baffle Fall
d) Rapids
a
9. What is the shape of upstream wings in design of baffle fall?
a) Trapezoidal
b) Rectangular
c) Circular
d) Square
c
10. What type of crest width is provided in designing a straight glacis fall?
a) Deep Crest
b) Shallow Crest
c) Broad Crest
d) Narrow Crest
d
