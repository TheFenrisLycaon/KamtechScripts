c) Meyer-Peter’s formula
d) Einstein’s formula
a
2. Which of the following statement is not correct about Einstein’s theory?
a) He put forward a mathematical approach to the problem of bed load transport
b) He further postulated probability of the grain being dislodged is directly proportional to the lift force which the flow can exert on the grain
c) He introduced a factor called Einstein’s bedload function
d) He gave a curve graph which can be used to compute the bedload transport rate of a given channel
a
3. If the width of a river increases, the discharge per unit width will decrease and therefore, sediment carrying capacity will increase.
a) True
b) False
b
4. Which of the following statement is not correct about sediment load phenomenon and its measurement?
a) The material is kept in suspension by the turbulence or by the generation of eddies
b) In laminar flow, the shear stress is caused due to the difference of the velocities at the top and the bottom
c) In turbulent flow, momentum transfer is not very significant
d) Due to the formation of eddies, the sediment transfer from high concentration  regions to the low concentration regions takes place
c
5. The sediment confined along and above the bed up to a depth ‘2d’ (d being grain size) is treated as bed load.

6. In a wide stream, a suspended load sample taken at a height of 0.30 m from the bed. The stream is 5.0 m deep and has a bed slope of 1/4000. The bed material can be of uniform size. Estimate the shear friction velocity.
a) 0.111 m/s
b) 0.211 m/s
c) 0.311 m/s
d) 0.711 m/s
a
V* = [(Dw. g.R.S)/Dw]1/2 = (g.R.S)1/2
V* = (9.81 x 5 x 1/4000)1/2 = 0.111 m/s.
7. For the usual turbulent flow, calculate the critical shear stress if the mean diameter of the grain particle of bed material is 0.3 mm.
a) 0.300 N/m2
b) 0.106 N/m2
c) 0.206 N/m2
d) 0.116 N/m2
c
S0 = 0.687 d
S0 = 0.687 x 0.3 = 0.206 N/m2.
8. Calculate the corresponding hydraulic mean depth that would exist in the channel if the bed was unrippled. The rugosity coefficient in an unrippled channel is 0.015 and the rugosity coefficient actually observed by experiments on the rippled bed of channel is 0.020. Consider the value of hydraulic mean depth of the channel as 1.5 m.
a) 1.5 m
b) 2.5 m
c) 0.97 m
d) 0.77 m
c
R’ = R (n’/n) 3/2 where, R = 1.5 m, n’ = 0.015, and n = 0.020
R’ = 1.5 x (0.015/0.020)3/2 = 0.97 m.
9. Calculate the quantity of bed load transport by using Meyer and Peter formula if the effective tractive force that causes bed load transportation is 2.5 N/m2.
a) 1.04 N/m/second
b) 1.5 N/m/second
c) 2.5 N/m/second
d) 0.476 N/m/second
a
Gb = 0.417 x Teff where Gb is the rate of bed transport by weight in N/m/second and Teff is an effective unit tractive force.
Gb = 0.417 x 2.5 = 1.04 N/m/second.
10. Calculate the effective unit tractive force that causes bed load transportation if the unit tractive force produced by the flowing water is 3.20 N/m2. The Manning’s coefficient on an unrippled bed is 0.0108 and the actual observed value of Manning’s coefficient on ripped channels is 0.0222. Take the value of critical shear stress that is required to move the grain particle as 0.5 N/m2.
a) 1.58 N/m2
b) 0.222 N/m2
c) 1.08 N/m2
d) 0.58 N/m2
d
S0‘= S0 (n’/n) 3/2 = 3.2 (0.0108/0.0222)3/2 = 1.08 N/m2.
The effective unit tractive force = S0’ – Sc = 1.08 – 0.5 = 0.58 N/m2.
