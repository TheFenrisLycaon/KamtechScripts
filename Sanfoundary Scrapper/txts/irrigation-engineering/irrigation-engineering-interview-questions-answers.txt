1. Which method involves the use of crop factor?
a) Penman’s equation
b) Hargreaves method
c) Blaney-Criddle Formula
d) Tanks and Lysimeter
c
Where, f = p/40 [1.8t + 32], Cu = seasonal consumptive use and k = crop factor. Crop factor is determined by experiments under environmental conditions of the particular area for each crop.
2. What are the dimensions of the standard class-A pan?
a) Diameter-1.2 m, Depth – 25 cm
b) Diameter-2 m, Depth – 25 cm
c) Diameter-2 m, Depth – 30 cm
d) Diameter-1.2 m, Depth – 30 cm
a
3. Penman’s equation for the estimation of PET has been derived by using ___________
a) energy balance approach
b) mass transfer approach
c) combination of energy balance approach and mass transfer approach
d) combination of energy balance approach and energy transfer approach
c
4. Albedo or reflection coefficient factor is used in which method?
a) Blaney- Criddle equation
b) Christiansen equation
c) Penman equation
d) Tank and Lysimeter method
c
5. Penman’s equation can also be used to compute evaporation from a water surface like a lake if _________
a) reflection coefficient = 0.05
b) reflection coefficient > 0.05
c) reflection coefficient < 0.05
d) reflection coefficient = 0.45- 0.90
a
6. The pan evaporation can also be determined by Christiansen formula.
a) True
b) False
a
Ct = Coefficient of temperature
Cw = Coefficient for wind velocity
Ch = Coefficient for relative humidity
Cs = Coefficient for percent of possible sunshine
Ce = Coefficient of elevation.
7. What is the consumptive use for a crop in the month of April having a consumptive use coefficient equal to 0.80 and pan evaporation is 35 cm?
a) 28 cm
b) 43.75 cm
c) 35.80 cm
d) 40.80 cm
a
Et = 0.8 x 35 = 28 cm
Hence, the required value of consumptive use = 28 cm.
8. Compute the total consumptive use for a drainage basin by Penman’s formula. The slope of saturation vapour pressure V/s chart at 40°C is 2.95 mm of Hg/°C and the net incoming solar radiation is 5.705 mm of evaporative water/day. Assume, Ea = 18.07 mm/day and Psychrometric constant = 0.49 mm of Hg/°C.
a) 17.01 mm/day
b) 18 mm/day
c) 11.07 mm/day
d) 20.45 mm/day
a
Cu = [2.95 x 5.705 + 18.07 x 0.49] / (2.95 + 0.49)
Cu = 17.01 mm/day.
9. What is the correct expression of parameter Ea in Penman’s equation?
a) Ea = 0.35 (1 + V2/160) (es – ea)
b) Ea = 0.35 (1 + V2/160) (es + ea)
c) Ea = 0.35 (1 – V2/160) (es – ea)
d) Ea = 0.35 (1 – V2/160) (es + ea)
a
Where, V2 is the wind mean speed at 2m above the ground in km/day, es  is Saturation vapour pressure at mean air temperature in mm of Hg, and ea is actual mean vapour pressure of air in mm of Hg.
