1. What is the formula for the upstream apron length according to Bligh?
a) 2.208 (CH)1/2
b) 2.208 (H/13)1/2
c) 2.208 (H)1/2
d) 2.208 (C/H)1/2
a
2. What is the empirical formula given by Bligh for the design of the top width of the weir wall?
a) B’ = H / (G-1)
b) B’ = H / (G-1)1/2
c) B’ = (H + height of weir)/G
d) B’ = H / (G+1)
b
3. What is the correct calculation for balance floor length?
a) Total length – (the downstream length + twice the cut-off length)
b) Total length + (the downstream length + twice the cut-off length)
c) The downstream length – twice the cut-off length
d) The downstream length + twice the cut-off length
a
4. The ordinate of the uplift pressure at a point is found to be 2.8 m while designing the downstream floor thickness of a weir. If the relative density of concrete is 2.4 then the minimum thickness of the floor to be provided for resisting uplift pressure without accounting safety factor is _______
a) 1.16 m
b) 2 m
c) 0.8 m
d) 2.8 m
b
t = h / (G-1) where h = 2.8 m and G = 2.4
t = 2.8 / 1.4 = 2 m.
5. The minimum thickness (t) of the downstream floor required in the design of weir can be expressed by the equation ___________
a) h / (G+1)
b) (h-t) / (G-1)
c) h / (G-1)
d) 1.33 h /(G-1)
c

6. The width provided at the site for the river to flow and also the length of the weir is ____________
a) waterway
b) launching apron
c) top width
d) bed mean width
a
7. BY increasing the length of the floor on the upstream of the weir axis?
a) the uplift pressure will increase below the floor downstream of the weir
b) the uplift pressure will decrease below the floor downstream of the weir
c) the uplift pressure will remain the same in both cases
d) the uplift pressure may increase or decrease
b
8. Calculate the length of the downstream floor for a vertical drop weir having crest shutters, if the total maximum head loss is 2.5 m. Assume the value of Bligh’s constant as 12.
a) 11.62 m
b) 11.80 m
c) 12 m
d) 10 m
a
As per Bligh, the length of D/s floor with crest shutters is given by –
L2 = 2.21 C (HL/13)1/2 = 11.62 m.
9. Calculate the top width of the weir wall (B’) if the head of the water over the weir wall at the time of the maximum flood is 2 m. Take the specific gravity of the floor material as 2.4.
a) 1.7 m
b) 2 m
c) 2.4 m
d) 1.3 m
a
Given G = 2.4 and H = 2 m
B’ = 2 / (2.4-1)1/2 = 1.69 m.
10. Calculate the length of upstream talus if the length of the downstream loose stone talus is 20 m.
a) 20 m
b) 10 m
c) 40 m
d) 15 m
b
Given the length of loose D/s talus = 20 m
The length of upstream talus = 20/2 = 10 m.
