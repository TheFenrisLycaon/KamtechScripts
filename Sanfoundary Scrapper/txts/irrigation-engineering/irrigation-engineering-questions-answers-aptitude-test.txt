1. Loss of canal discharge occurs mainly due to?
a) Seepage and Percolation
b) Percolation and Absorption
c) Seepage and Evaporation
d) Seepage and Absorption
c
2. Which of the following factor do not affect seepage loss?
a) Underground water-table condition
b) The porosity of the soil
c) Physical properties of the canal water
d) Prevailing wind velocity in the region
d
3. In which of the following phenomenon there is a continuous direct flow between the canal and the underground water table?
a) Absorption
b) Seepage
c) Percolation
d) Both Absorption and Percolation
c
4. Which of the following factor have no influence on evaporation loss?
a) The temperature of the region
b) Prevailing wind velocity in the region
c) Area of water surface exposed to the atmosphere
d) The porosity of the soil
d
5. In the phenomenon of Absorption, the extent of saturation goes on increasing from the ground level below the soil with depth.
a) True
b) False
b
6. According to Etcheverry and Harding, the range of conveyance loss is highest in which soil?
a) Sandy Loam
b) Loose sandy soil
c) Clay Loam
d) Rocks
b
For Sandy loam = 3.66 to 5.18
For Clay loam = 1.83 to 3.66
For rocks = about 0.9.
7. Which of the following empirical formula is used in Punjab for calculating channel losses?
a) Q’ = 1.9 Q1/6
b) Q’ = 1/200 x (B+D)2/3
c) Q’ = 1.9 Q
d) Q’ = 1/200 x (B-D)2/3
a
Where Q’ = Losses in cumecs per million sq.m of the wetted perimeter, Q = Discharge in cumecs.
The formula is used in U.P is; Q’ = 1/200 x (B + D)2/3 where B is the bed width of channel and D is the depth of water in the channel in meters.
8. Inflow and Outflow method is generally used to measure ____________
a) transpiration loss
b) seepage loss
c) evaporation loss
d) percolation loss
b
9. Which of the following statement is incorrect?
a) The seepage loss is very high in black cotton soils and heavy clay as compared to sandy porous soil
b) The seepage through a new canal is more than from a silted canal
c) The more the silt, the lesser are the losses
d) The more the velocity, the lesser will be the losses
a
10. Which soil has the least range of conveyance loss according to Etcheverry and Harding?
a) Sandy Loam
b) Clay Loam
c) Loose sandy soil
d) Impervious clay loam
d
