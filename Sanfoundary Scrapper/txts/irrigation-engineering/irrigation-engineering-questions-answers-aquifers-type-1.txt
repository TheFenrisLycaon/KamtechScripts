b) aquifuse
c) aquiclude
d) aquitard
d
2. The geological formation which may contain water but does not contain any yield is ____________
a) aquifer
b) aquifuse
c) aquiclude
d) aquitard
c
3. Which of the following geological formation contains and readily yields water to our tube wells?
a) Aquifer
b) Aquifuse
c) Aquiclude
d) Aquitard
a
4. Which of the following geological formation does not contain any amount of groundwater?
a) Aquitard
b) Aquifer
c) Aquiclude
d) Aquifuge
d
5. The quantum of water contained in the soil pores which cannot be extracted by gravity drainage is called _____________
a) pellicular water
b) capillary water
c) hygroscopic water
d) available water
a
6. What is the volume of groundwater which can be extracted by gravity drainage from a soil stratum when expressed as percentage fraction of the volume of the soil stratum?
a) Pellicular water
b) Available water
c) Specific yield
d) Field capacity
c
Specific Yield = (Volume of the water obtained by gravity drainage/ total volume of drained material) x 100.
7. Field capacity of a ground aquifer equals _________
a) specific yield
b) 100 – specific yield
c) 100/ specific yield
d) field capacity
b
F.C = volume of water held against gravity drainage/total volume of the material drained x 100
The summation of Specific yield and field capacity is equal to the porosity.
8. Specific retention of groundwater is larger in coarse-grained soils.
a) True
b) False
b
9. Water wells excavated through confined aquifers are known as ______________
a) artesian wells
b) non-artesian wells
c) gravity wells

a
10. In case of a flowing well, the piezometric surface is always _________
a) below the ground level
b) above the ground level
c) at the ground level
d) above or below the ground level
b
