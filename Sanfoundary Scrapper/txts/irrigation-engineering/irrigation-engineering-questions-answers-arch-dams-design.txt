a) Plane sections normal to the axis remain plane after flexure
b) Any horizontal arch ring is independent of the arch rings below and above
c) Modulus of elasticity of concrete and rock foundation is equal for compression and tension
d) Stresses are proportional to strains
b
4. The thin cylinder theory for designing arch dams is based only on ___________________
a) temperature stresses
b) ice pressures
c) yield stresses
d) hydrostatic water pressure
d
5. The temperature stresses producing worst effects in the design of arch dams are caused by ______________
a) rise in temperature
b) fall in temperature
c) both rise and fall
d) no effect in the design
b
6. The stresses due to rib-shortening become quite important in the case of _____________
a) long thin arch dams
b) thick arch dams of small angle
c) both thin and thick arch dams
d) all types of arch dams
b
7. Which of the following is not the basis for the design of an arch dam?
a) Thin cylinder theory
b) Trial load theory
c) Unit column theory
d) Elastic theory
c
• Thin cylinder theory
• Theory of Elastic arches
• Trial load method
Out of these methods, the trial load method is generally adopted nowadays and it gives precise results.
8. According to thin cylinder theory, the volume of concrete required for an arch dam would be minimum if the central angle is ____________
a) 130° 34’
b) 133° 34’
c) 143° 34’
d) 153° 34’
b
9. The best design of an arch dam is when __________________
a) all horizontal water loads are transferred horizontally to the abutments
b) the dam is safe against sliding at various levels
c) the load is divided between the arches and cantilevers and the deflections at the conjugal points being equal
d) the deflections of the cantilevers are equal at different points
c
10. At a given elevation, the thickness of the arch ring is proportional to the radius of the arch.
a) True
b) False
a
t = ϒw . h. r / fc where r is the radius of the arch, h is depth, fc is the allowable compressive stress for the arch material and ϒw is the unit weight of water.
It is clear from the above equation that the thickness of the arch is proportional to the radius of the arch at a given elevation.
