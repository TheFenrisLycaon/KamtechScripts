b) low heights
c) medium heights
d) any height
a
3. Which of the following dam requires no reinforcement?
a) Fixed deck buttress dam
b) Simple deck buttress dam
c) Cantilever deck buttress dam
d) Massive head buttress dam
d
4. Which of the following dam is also known as the Amberson dam?
a) Multiple arch buttress dam
b) Mushroom head buttress dam
c) Massive head buttress dam
d) Free deck buttress dam
d
5. Which of the following component of a buttress dam is also called counterfort?
a) Corbel
b) Buttress
c) Lateral brace
d) Sloping deck
b
6. Which of the following type of dam requires very strong and stable foundations and is not in use as much as the other types?
a) Multiple dome-type dams
b) Massive head type dam
c) Columnar buttress type dam
d) Deck slab type dam
c
7. Which of the following is the earliest recorded multiple arch buttress dam?
a) Meer Alam dam in India
b) The Coolidge dam in Arizona
c) Rodriguez dam in Mexico
d) Idduki dam in Kerela, India
a
8. In a simple deck slab buttress dam of a given height, the buttress spacing can be increased by increasing the upstream slope.
a) True
b) False
a
9. The buttresses of a free deck buttress dam are provided at ‘x’ m clear spacing and buttress thickness is proposed to be ‘t’ m. The buttress section can then be designed like the section of a concrete gravity dam by considering the effective unit weight of water = Surcharge factor (S) x actual unit weight of water. The value of this surcharge factor is given as _____________
a) S = (x + t)/x
b) S = (x + t)/t
c) S = (x + t)/(x + 1)
d) S = (x + t)/(t + 1)
b
S = (x + t)/t
The resultant impact can be considered by increasing the unit weight of water by multiplying the actual value by a surcharge factor.
10. What is the suggested economic buttress spacing for a mean dam height of greater than 45 m?
a) 4.5
b) 4.5 to 7.5
c) 7.5 to 12
d) 12 to 15
