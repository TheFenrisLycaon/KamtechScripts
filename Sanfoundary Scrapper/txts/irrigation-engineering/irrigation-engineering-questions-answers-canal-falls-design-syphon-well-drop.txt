1. ______________ fall is adopted for smaller discharges and larger drops.
a) Ogee fall
b) Sarda fall
c) Glacis fall
d) Well-type fall
d
2. Consider the following statements.
I. Syphon falls are commonly used where high levelled small drains do out-fall into a low levelled bigger drain.
II. The D/s well is necessary in case of falls greater than 1.8 m and for discharges greater than 0.29 cumecs.
III. The design discharge is determined based on the fact that V-notch is used.
Which of the following statement is correct?
a) I only
b) II only
c) I and II
d) I, II and III
c
3. Calculate the velocity over the notch (V1) and the velocity through the pipe (V3) if the full supply discharge is 2 cumecs. The area of flow over the trapezoidal notch is 0.58 m2. Assume the value of diameter of the pipe used as 1 m.
a) V1 = 3.44 m/sec and V3 = 2.54 m/sec
b) V1 = 2.54 m/sec and V3 = 3.44 m/sec
c) V1 = 3.44 m/sec and V3 = 3.44 m/sec
d) V1 = 0.44 m/sec and V3 = 2.04 m/sec
a
V1 = 2/0.58 = 3.44 m/sec
V3 = 2/0.785 = 2.54 m/sec (Area of pipe = 0.785 m2).
4. What is the height of the centre of pressure above the water level in the inlet well if the R.L of the centre of pressure is 150.83 m and the R.L of water level in inlet well is 148.30 m?
a) 2.53 m
b) 1.78 m
c) 3 m
d) 1.99 m
a
Y = R.L of C.P – R.L of water level in inlet well
Y = 150.83 – 148.30
Y = 2.53 m.
5. Calculate the diameter of the inlet well if the X and Y coordinate of the jet (issuing from the centre of pressure) w.r.t the water surface in the inlet well is 1.05 m and 1.88 m respectively.
a) 1.575 m
b) 2.82 m
c) 1.79 m
d) 0.83 m
a
Given, X = 1.05 and Y = 1.88
Diameter = 1.5 x 1.05 = 1.575 m.
6. Which of the following loss is not considered while calculating the total head loss between the inlet well and D/s FSL?
a) Entry and exit losses
b) Loss due to friction
c) Loss due to enlargement of the section
d) Loss due to contraction of section
d
HL = 0.5 V22/2g (Entry loss) + (V2 – V3)2/2g (sudden enlargement loss) + fLV32/2gd (Friction loss) + V32/2g (Exit loss)
Where, V2 = Velocity of entry in pipe, V3 = Velocity through the pipe, L = assumed pipe length, d = diameter of the pipe, f = Darcy’s coefficient of friction = 0.012 and g = acceleration due to gravity.
7. The discharge formula used in the design of the syphon well drop is ____________
a) 8/15 Cd. (2g)1/2. tan (Q/2). H5/2
b) 2/3 Cd. (2g)1/2. L. H3/2
c) 8/15 Cd. (2g)1/2. tan (Q/2). H3/2
d) 2.22H3/2 [L + 0.4nH] 
d
Q = 2/3 Cd. (2g)1/2. L. H3/2 + 8/15 Cd. (2g)1/2. tan (Q/2). H5/2
Q = 2.22H3/2 [L + 0.4nH] 
(Where n = 2 tan (Q/2) and coefficient of discharge = 0.75).
8. Which of the following statement is wrong?
a) In a trapezoidal notch fall, the top width of the notch is kept between 3/4th to full water depth above the sill of the notch
b) The syphon fall is designed to maintain a fixed supply level in the channel
c) A cylinder fall is popularly known as syphon well drop
d) Energy dissipators are provided for small discharges
d
