1. A curve in channel results in _____________
a) silting on inside (convex side) and scouring on outside (concave side)
b) scouring on inside (convex side) and scouring on outside (concave side)
c) both silting and scouring on inside
d) both silting and scouring on outside
a
2. If the discharging capacity of the channel is less than 0.5 cumecs then, the minimum recommended value for curve radius is _________
a) 150 m
b) 100 m
c) 300 m
d) 600 m
b
3. The Gross Command Area (G.C.A) represents the geographical area of the Doab.
a) True
b) False
a
4. What is the Annual Intensity of irrigation (AII)?
a) Gross Irrigated Area/Cultivable Command Area
b) Cultivable Command Area/Gross Irrigated Area
c) Net Irrigated Area/Cultivable Command Area
d) Cultivable Command Area/Net Irrigated Area
a
5. What is Gross Cropped Area?
a) Net irrigated area + Area irrigated more than once during the same year
b) Net cropped area + Area sown more than once during the same year
c) Net irrigated area + Net cropped area
d) Total area irrigated once a year + area irrigated more than once in that year
b
6. The ratio of the actual operating period of a distributary to the crop period is called as ____________
a) capacity factor
b) time factor
c) full supply coefficient
d) nominal duty
b
7. The number of hectares irrigable per cumec of the canal capacity at its head is known as ____________
a) nominal duty
b) duty on capacity
c) design full supply discharge
d) capacity factor
b
8. The cropped area in Rabi season is usually increased.
a) True
b) False
a
9. The Gross Command Area for a distributary is 8000 hectares 80% of which is culturable irrigable. The intensity of irrigation for Rabi season is 50% and the average duty at the head of the distributary is 2000 hectares/cumec. Determine the discharge required at the head of the distributary.
a) 1.33 cumec
b) 1.60 cumec
c) 1.40 cumec
d) 1.44 cumec
b
The area to be irrigated = CCA x Intensity of irrigation = 6400 x 50/100 = 3200 hectares
The water required at the head of the distributary = 3200/2000 = 1.6 cumec.
10. The CCA of a water course is 1500 hectares. The intensity of sugarcane and wheat crops is 20% and 40% respectively. The duties for the crops at the head of the watercourse are 730 hectares/cumec and 1600 hectares/cumec respectively. Calculate the design discharge at the outlet assuming a time factor equal to 0.8.
a) 0.55 cumec
b) 1.0 cumec
c) 0.72 cumec
d) 0.92 cumec
c
Area to be irrigated under wheat = 1500 x 40/100 = 600 hectares
Discharge required for sugarcane = 300/730 = 0.410 cumec
Discharge required for wheat = 600/1800 = 0.333 cumec
The discharge required at the head of the water course = 0.410 + 0.333 = 0.743 cumec
The actual design discharge at the outlet = 0.743/0.8 = 0.92 cumec.
11. The transplantation of rice takes 18 days and the total depth of water required by the crop is 60 cm on the field. During this transplantation period, rain starts falling and about 10 cm of rain is being utilized to fulfill the rice demand. Find the duty of irrigation water required for rice assuming 25% losses of water in watercourses.
a) 233.28 hectares/cumec
b) 240 hectares/cumec
c) 230 hectares/cumec
d) 244.44 hectares/cumec
a
Duty of irrigation water = 864 B/D = 864 x 18/50 = 311.04 hectares/cumec
Duty at the head of the watercourse = 311.04 x (1-0.25) = 233.28 hectares/cumec.
