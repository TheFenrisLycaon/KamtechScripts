5. What is the minimum value of inspection bank width recommended by Indian Standards if the discharge is more than 30 cumecs?
a) 8.0
b) 5.0
c) 6.0
d) 7.0
a
6. When the concrete lining is not reinforced in a channel, velocities up to 2.5 m/sec are permitted.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Calculate hydraulic mean depth for concrete-lined channel to carry a discharge of 350 cumecs at a slope of 1 in 5000. The value of manning’s constant for the lining is 0.015. The side slopes of a channel may be taken as 1.5:1. Assume limiting velocity in the channel as 2m/sec.
a) 2.20 m
b) 2.40 m
c) 2.60 m
d) 2.80 m
d
2 = 1/0.015 x R2/3 x 1/50001/2
R = 2.80 m.
8. Calculate the central depth of a triangular channel section to carry a discharge of 15 cumecs. Consider the available slope as 1 in 9000. Assume the side slopes of the channel be 1.25:1 and manning’s constant is 0.015 for good brick work in lining.
a) 2.94 m
b) 3.14 m
c) 2.25 m
d) 2.77 m
a
A = y2 (Q + cotQ) = 1.925y2 and R = y/2
Q = 1/n.A.R2/3.S1/2
15 = 1/0.015 x 1.925y2 x (0.5y)2/3x 1/90001/2
y = 2.94 m.
