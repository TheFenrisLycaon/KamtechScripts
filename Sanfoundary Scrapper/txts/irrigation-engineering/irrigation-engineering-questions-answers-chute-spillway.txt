a) a concave vertical curve
b) a convex vertical curve
c) a hyperbolic curve
d) a parabolic curve
a

b
9. The portion of a chute spillway which is known as its control structure is ________________
a) low ogee weir
b) chute channel
c) approach channel leading the water from the reservoir to the ogee weir
d) silting basin at its bottom
a
10. The type of spillway which is provided on narrow valleys where no side flanks are available is ____________________
a) ogee spillway
b) chute spillway
c) side-channel spillway
d) straight drop spillway
c
11. Which of the following curve is provided when the slope of the chute changes from milder to steeper?
a) Concave vertical curve
b) Hyperbolic curve
c) Convex vertical curve
d) Straight plan
c
12. Calculate the freeboard for the top levels of the side walls if the mean velocity of water in the chute reach is 3.5 m/s and the mean depth of water in the chute reach under consideration is 4.7 m.
a) 0.60 m
b) 1 m
c) 0.85 m
d) 0.55 m
c
F.B = 0.61 + 0.04 Vm. dm1/3 where ‘Vm‘ is the mean velocity of water in the chute reach and ‘dm’ is the mean depth of water in the chute reach under consideration.
F.B = 0.61 + 0.04 x 3.5 x 4.71/3 = 0.84 m.

b) 0.45% of the concrete area
c) 0.30% of the concrete area
d) 0.25% of the concrete area
d
