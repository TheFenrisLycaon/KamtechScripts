5. In a siphon aqueduct, the worst condition of uplift on the floor occurs when ________
a) the canal is full and the drainage empty with the water table at drainage bed
b) the canal and drainage are flowing full
c) the canal is empty and the drainage full with the water table at drainage bed
d) the canal is full and the drainage empty with water table below the floor
c
6. To reduce the cost of the CD works we resort to _____
a) fluming
b) blocking of drain
c) cut-off
d) lifting of canal water
a
7. The greater is the fluming, the greater is the length of upstream and downstream transition wings.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Which of the following wings protect the earthen slopes of the canal and also guide the drainage water?
a) Canal wings
b) Land wings
c) River wings
d) Side wings
c
9. The head loss through a siphon barrel is usually given by Unwin’s formula by neglecting velocity of approach as HL = [1 + F1 + F2. L/R] V2/2g, where F1 and F2 respectively represent the coefficient of head losses due to?
a) Barrel friction and entry
b) Entry and barrel friction
c) Barrel friction and exit
d) Exit and barrel friction
b
HL = [1 + F1 + F2. L/R] V2/2g
where F1 is coefficient of head loss at entry and F2 is coefficient such that loss of head due to surface friction is given by F2 = a[1+b/R], a and b are the values depending upon the material of the surface of the barrel.
10. The floor of a siphon aqueduct needs to be designed for conditions when?
i. The canal and drainage are flowing full
ii. The canal is full and there is no drainage discharge
iii. The canal is empty and drainage  discharge is full
a) i only
b) ii only
c) i and ii
d) ii and iii
d
I. full water load and dead weight with no uplift
II. full-uplift with no water load.
The floor should be designed for the summation of the total uplift caused due to the seepage and the static head.
11. A siphon aqueduct is constructed at a canal crossing site where drainage HFL was 212.2 m by allowing an afflux of 0.4 m at high flood discharge. At this site, the water level downstream of the crossing at the same high flood will be _________
a) 212.2 m
b) 212.6 m
c) 211.8 m
d) It cannot be predicted
a
The D/s water level = 212.2 m
The U/s water level = 212.2 + 0.4 = 212.6 m.
12. The following data is available at the proposed site of a canal crossing:
Item
Drain
Canal
B.L (m)
252.2
248
FSL/HFL (m)
253.2
253
Discharge(cumecs)
2
400
The most appropriate and economical CD work at the above site will be:
a) An aqueduct
b) A super-passage
c) A siphon aqueduct
d) A siphon
d
13. Calculate the depth of cut-off for scour holes for an irrigation channel of F.S.Q equal to 354 cumecs and H.F.Q of natural drainage equal to 600 cumecs. Assume the value of friction factor as 1.
a) 7 m
b) 7.5 m
c) 10.5 m
d) 8 m
c
R = 0.47 (354/1)1/3 = 7 m
The depth of cut-off provided for scour holes = 1.5 R (on both sides)
= 1.5 x 7 = 10.5 m.
14. Calculate the value of hydraulic mean radius for a channel designed by Lacey’s theory which has a mean velocity of 1m/sec. The silt factor can be taken as unity.
a) 1 m
b) 0.5 m
c) 2 m
d) 2.5 m
d
R = 5/2 (V2/f) where V = 1 m/sec and f = silt factor = 1.
R = 2.5 m.
