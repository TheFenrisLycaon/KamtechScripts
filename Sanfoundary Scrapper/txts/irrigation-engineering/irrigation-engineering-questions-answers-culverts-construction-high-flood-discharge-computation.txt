1. What is the design frequency discharge for road bridges and culverts?
a) 1 in 100 years
b) 1 in 50 years
c) 1 in 75 years
d) 1 in 25 years
b
2. The existing width of the stream is contracted at the bridge site by _________
a) U/s wing walls
b) D/s wing walls
c) Canal wings
d) Drain wings
a
3. For purely rigid streams, the foundation of the bridge substructure is taken above the bed.
a) True
b) False
b
4. Consider the following statements for quasi-alluvial streams.
i. The bed is not pitched and sides are banked with stable soils or pitching
ii. The bridge span length is equal to the length of water line between banks measured along HFL
iii. The stream is not contracted
Which of the following statements are correct?
a) i and ii
b) ii and iii
c) i and iii
d) i,ii and iii
a
D = D’ (W’/L)0.61 where W’ = the natural unobstructed width of the stream and D’ = the scour depth in the quasi-alluvial stream having L=W’.
5. The relation between the scour depth (R) and Regime scour depth (Re) for an alluvial river having regime width (W) and contracted width (B) is given by ______
a) R = Re (W/B)0.61
b) R = Re (B/W)0.61
c) R = Re (W/B)0.33
d) R = Re (W/B)0.33
a
The value of Lacey’s regime scour depth (Re) is given by R = Re (W/B)0.61.
6. The Lacey’s scour depth R given by equation R = 0.473 (Q/f)1/3 is applicable when the river width is equal to ___________
a) actual river width
b) regime width
c) any contracted width
d) span length
b
Silt factor (f) is obtained by the equation f = 1.76 d1/2 where d is the average size of particle in mm.
7. Culverts are all those road bridges whose spans are up to ________
a) 6 m
b) 8 m
c) 10 m
d) 12 m
b
8. A road bridge is proposed to be constructed across an alluvial stream with the estimated design discharge as 2500 m3/s. It is decided to adopt a total effective waterway equal to 300 m for this bridge as against the regime width of 237.5 m due to afflux considerations. If the HFL at the site is at RL 214 m, then the RL of the open foundation can be suggested as _______
a) 206.6 m
b) 208.5 m
c) 207.2 m
d) 210.2 m
a
R = 1.35 (q2/f)1/3 = 1.35 (2500/300)1/3 = 5.55 m
The foundation may be taken down below HFL by 1.33R or R + 1.2 m (whichever is more).
i. 1.33R = 7.38 m
ii. R + 1.2 = 6.75 m (<7.38 m)
Hence, foundation level = 214 – 7.38 = 206.6 m.
9. Calculate the value of maximum scour depth for a single span structure having normal scour depth 5m.
a) 5 m
b) 7.5 m
c) 2.5 m
d) 10 m
b
Maximum scour depth = 1.5 x 5 = 7.5 m.
10. The average grain size of the bed material is 0.16 mm for medium silt, Lacey’s silt factor is likely to be _______
a) 0.30
b) 0.45
c) 0.70
d) 1.32
c
F = 1.76 (0.16)1/2
F = 0.704.
11. The waterway for a bridge on the river in alluvial plain having a dominant discharge of 3600 cumecs should be ________ m.
a) 250 m
b) 285 m
c) 300 m
d) 225 m
b
W = L = 4.75 Q1/2 = 4.75 x 60 = 285 m.
