1. The bar screens used to cover the dam outlets to prevent entry of debris, or ice into the spillway conduits are called __________________
a) gate controlled ports
b) projecting collars
c) trash racks
d) intakes
c
2. Projecting collars are provided on sides of a rectangular tunnel of length L made through an earthen dam to increase the seepage path. Their projection length (X) and numbers (N) are decided so as to provide increased seepage path equal to 2NX where 2NX should generally be ______________________
a) greater than L/4
b) greater than L/3
c) greater than L/2
d) greater than L
a
3. The outlet provided in a dam body to release water for the downstream water demand is known as ______________________
a) spillway
b) sluiceway
c) under-sluice
d) waterway
b
4. A 2 m diameter sluiceway at RL 300 m is provided through a concrete overflow dam section to release water to the downstream where tail water level is not more than 275 m. The discharge through this outlet when the water level in the reservoir is at FRL of 330 m is of the order of_________________
a) 20 cumecs
b) 40 cumecs
c) 50 cumecs
d) 80 cumecs
c
Q = Cd. A. (2gHL)1/2 where Cd is the coefficient of discharge = 0.62 for free over-fall, H = Water head over centre line of sluice = 330 – 300 = 30 m and A = π/4 x 4 = 3.14 m2
Q = 0.62 x 3.14 x (2 x 9.81 x 30)1/2 = 47.23 cumecs.
5. A 4 m diameter tunnel has been constructed through an earthen dam with a bell mouth entry. The water levels on the U/s and D/s sides of the dam are at RL 226 m and 210 m respectively. What will be the discharge through this outlet?
a) 64 cumecs
b) 104 cumecs
c) 165 cumecs
d) 216 cumecs
c
Q = Cd. A. (2gHL)1/2  where HL = 226 – 210 = 16 m
Q = 0.8 x (π/4 x 16) x (2 x 9.81 x 16) = 164 cumecs.
6. Which of the following entrance of the sluiceway is most superior?
a) A square-edged entrance
b) A Bell-mouthed entrance
c) A rectangular entrance
d) A circular entrance
b
7. What is the correct Douma’s equation for rectangular tunnels or conduits?
a) X2 + 10.4 Y2 = d2
b) 4X2 + 10.4 Y2 = d2
c) 4X2 + 44.4 Y2 = d2
d) X2 – 10.4 Y2 = d2
a
i. For circular conduits: 4X2 + 44.4 Y2 = d2 where d is the diameter of the circular conduit
ii. For rectangular tunnels or conduits: X2 + 10.4 Y2 = d2 where d is the width or height of the conduit depending on whether the sides or top and bottom curves are being designed. Where X and Y are the coordinates of any point on the curve and d is the width or height of the conduit.
8. What is the value of head loss for the fully open gate and butterfly valves?
a) 0.5 V2 / 2g
b) V2 / 2g
c) 0.2 V2 / 2g
d) 0.04 V2 / 2g
c
