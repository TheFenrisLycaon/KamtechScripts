1. What is the U.S.B.R recommended value for freeboard when the height of the dam is more than 60 m?
a) 2 m to 3 m
b) 2.5 m above the top of gates
c) 3 m above the top of gates
d) More than 3 m
c
2. What is the recommended formula for top width of a very low dam?
a) H + 3
b) 0.2H + 3
c) 0.2 H
d) H + 5
b
A = H/5 + 3 where H is the height of the dam.
3. What is the Terzaghi’s recommended value of U/s side slope for earth dam of height less than 15m of homogenous silty clay?
a) 2: 1
b) 2.5: 1
c) 3: 1
d) 3.5: 1
b
4. If the height of the dam is 10 m, then the value of top width (A) according to Strange’s recommendations is _________________
a) 1.85 m
b) 2.5 m
c) 3.0 m
d) 4.0 m
b
5. When the height of the dam is in between 7.5 to 15, the Strange’s recommended value for maximum freeboard of low earth dams is ______________
a) 1.2 to 1.5
b) 1.5 to 1.8
c) 1.85
d) 2.1
c
6. Calculate the top width (A) of the earth dam of height 50 m.
a) 5.0 m
b) 4.75 m
c) 6.10 m
d) 3 m
c
A = 1.65 (H + 1.5)1/3 where H is the height of the dam.
A = 1.65 (50 + 1.5)1/3 = 6.13 m.
7. A phreatic line in seepage analysis is defined as the line on which pressure is _______________
a) equal to the atmosphere
b) greater than atmosphere
c) lower than atmosphere
d) varying
a
8. Provision of horizontal berms at suitable vertical intervals may be provided in the downstream face of an earthen dam in order to _________________
a) allow the movement of cattle
b) allow the inspection of vehicles to move
c) reduce the erosion caused by the flowing rainwater
d) increase the erosion
c
It behaves like a good lining for reducing losses and leakage.
They provide protection against erosion and breaches due to wave action.
They help the channel to attain regime conditions as they help in providing a wider waterway.
It can be used as borrow pits for excavating soil to be used for filling.
9. During seepage through an earthen mass, the direction of seepage is ________________ to the equipotential lines.
a) perpendicular
b) parallel
c) not defined
d) diagonal
a
10. The upstream face of the earth dam is considered as _____________________
a) equipotential line
b) streamline
c) streak line
d) path line
a
10. The effects of capillary fringe are on the slightly safer side and are neglected.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Which of the following line acts as a dividing line between dry (or moist) and submerged line?
a) Equipotential line
b) Path line
c) Seepage line
d) Streak line
c
