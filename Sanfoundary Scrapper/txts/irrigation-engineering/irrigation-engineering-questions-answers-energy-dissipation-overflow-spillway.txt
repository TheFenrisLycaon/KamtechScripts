1. The energy dissipation at the toe of the spillway is affected basically by the use of hydraulic jump in _______________________
a) roller bucket
b) a ski-jump bucket
c) a sloping apron below the downstream river bed
d) both roller and ski-jump bucket
c
2. The most ideal condition for energy dissipation in the design of spillways is the one when the tail-water rating curve coincides with the jump rating curve at all discharge.
a) True
b) False
a
3. When the tail-water depths in the river downstream of a spillway are quite low such that the tail-water curve at all discharges lies below the post jump depth curve, then the energy dissipation can be affected best by ___________________
a) a roller bucket
b) a ski-jump bucket
c) either roller or ski-jump bucket
d) a sloping apron
b
4. The device which does not help in energy dissipation at the bottom of a hydraulic structure over which water spills is ________________
a) chute block
b) dentated sill
c) morning glory
d) baffle piers
c
5. The formation of hydraulic jump at the foot of a spillway is one of the common methods of energy dissipation because ______________________
a) it destroys more than 90% of total energy by the turbulence produced in the jump
b) it reduces the kinetic energy by increasing the depth of flow
c) its action is not understood
d) it reduces the kinetic energy by decreasing the depth of flow
a
6. A ski-jump bucket is also known as _____________________
a) flip bucket
b) solid roller bucket
c) slotted roller bucket
d) flexible bucket
a

8. Which of the following stilling basin help in stabilizing the flow and improve the jump performance?
a) dentated sills
b) chute blocks
c) baffle piers
d) friction blocks
b
9. What is the expected solution for the case when the T.W.C is lying above the J.H.C curve at all discharges?
a) By providing a simple concrete apron of length 5(Y1 – Y2)
b) By providing a sloping apron above the river bed
c) By providing a sloping apron below the river bed
d) Provision of a ski-jump bucket
b
1) By constructing a sloping apron above the river bed
2) By providing a roller bucket type of energy dissipator.
In this case, the jump is formed at the toe will be drowned by the tail-water and little energy will be dissipated.
10. A sloping apron is provided partly above the river bed and partly below the river bed in case of ____________________________
a) when TWC coincides with the JHC at all discharges
b) when TWC lies above the JHC at all discharges
c) when TWC lies below the JHC at all discharges
d) when TWC lies above the JHC at low discharges and below the JHC at high discharges
d
11. When the TWC lies below the JHC at all discharges, the problem can be solved by which of the following provisions?
i. Constructing a sloping apron above the river bed
ii. Provision of roller bucket type of energy dissipator
iii. Provision of a ski-jump bucket
iv. A sloping apron below the river bed
v. Construction of a subsidiary dam
vi. A sloping apron partly above and partly below the river bed
a) i, iii and v
b) i, ii and vi
c) iii, iv and v
d) i, iii, iv and v
c
i. Provision of a ski-jump bucket
ii. A sloping apron below the river bed of length 5 (y2 – y1)
iii. Construction of a subsidiary dam below the main dam.
