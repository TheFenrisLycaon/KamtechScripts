1. The design annual rainfall for the catchment of a proposed reservoir has been computed to be 99 cm. The catchment area contributing to the proposed reservoir is 1000 sq.km having a mean annual temperature of 20°C. Calculate the annual design catchment yield for the reservoir using Khosla’s formula.
a) 89.4 M.m3
b) 8.94 M.m3
c) 894 m3
d) 894 M.m3
d
Q = P – 0.48 Tm where, Rainfall (P) = 99 cm and Mean annual temperature (Tm) = 20°C
Q = 99 – 0.48 x 20 = 89.4 cm = 0.894 m
The total yield produced from the given catchment = 0.894 x 1000 x 106 = 894 M.m3.
2. The reservoir capacity cannot exceed the catchment yield.
a) True
b) False
a
i. The accessed gross storage required to meet the demand
ii. The accessed dependable yield for the reservoir site.
3. With the reduction in reservoir capacity over the passage of time, the trap efficiency ___________
a) increases
b) decreases
c) remains unaffected
d) may increase or decrease depending upon the reservoir characteristics
b
4. Trap efficiency of a storage reservoir is defined as the ratio of ___________________
a) total annual sediment inflow to the reservoir capacity
b) total sediment deposited in a given period to the total sediment inflow in that period
c) total annual sediment deposited in the reservoir to the dead storage capacity of the reservoir
d) reservoir capacity to the total annual sediment
b
5. Capacity inflow ratio for a storage reservoir is defined as the ratio of  _______________________
a) reservoir capacity to the average annual flood inflow
b) reservoir capacity to the average annual sediment inflow
c) the dead storage capacity of the reservoir to the average annual sediment deposited
d) total annual sediment inflow to the reservoir capacity
a
6. The capacity-inflow ratio for a reservoir _________________
a) is a constant factor overtime
b) increases with time
c) decreases with time
d) may increase or decrease with time
c
7. A sequent peak algorithm is a plot between __________________
a) Accumulated flow v/s time
b) Discharge v/s time
c) (Cumulative Inflow – Cumulative Outflow) v/s time
d) Mass outflow v/s time
d
8. A flow duration curve is a curve plotted between ________________
a) Accumulated flow v/s time
b) Discharge v/s time
c) (Cumulative Inflow – Cumulative Outflow) v/s time
d) Streamflow v/s Percent of time the flow is equaled or exceeded
d
9. A steep slope of the flow duration curve indicates a stream with _________________
a) highly variable discharge
b) small variability of flow
c) considerable base flow
d) large flood plains
a
10. The lowest portion of the capacity-elevation curve of a proposed irrigation reservoir draining 20 km2 of catchment is represented by the following data:
i. The rate of silting for the catchment = 300 m3 / km2 / year
ii. Life of the reservoir = 50 years
iii. Dead storage = 30
iv. The FSD of the canal at the head = 80 cm
v. The crop water requirement = 250 ha.m
vi. Dependable yield of the catchment = 0.29 m
Calculate the gross capacity of the reservoir.
a) 287.5 ha.m
b) 317.5 ha.m
c) 580 ha.m
d) 37.5 ha.m
b
Live storage to meet the given demand = 250 + 37.5 = 287.5 ha.m
Gross storage required to meet the demand = live storage + dead storage = 287.5 + 30 = 317.5 ha.m
Dependable yield = 0.29 x 20 x 106 = 580 ha.m
The gross capacity is fixed at the lesser value of the gross storage and the dependable yield. Hence, the reservoir capacity = 317.5 ha.m.
