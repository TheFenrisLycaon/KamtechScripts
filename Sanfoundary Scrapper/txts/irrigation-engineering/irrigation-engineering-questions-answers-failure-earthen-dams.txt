1. Stone pitching or riprap is generally provided to avoid _______________
a) over-topping
b) erosion of U/s and d/s face
c) cracking due to frost action
d) gully formation
b
2. Provision of sufficient freeboard eliminates _______________

i. Over-topping failure
ii. Erosion of U/s face
iii. Erosion of D/s face
iv. Cracking due to frost action
v. Gully formation
Which of the following is/are correct?
a) i and v
b) ii and iii
c) iv and v
d) i and iv
d
3. The collection and removal of water before it acquires high downward velocities is ensured by provision of ____________________
a) berms
b) freeboard
c) burrow pits
d) spoil banks
a
The provision of berms serves the following purposes –
• It behaves like a good lining for reducing losses and leakage
• They provide protection against erosion and breaches due to wave action
• They help the channel to attain regime conditions as they help in providing a wider waterway
• It can be used as borrow pits for excavating soil to be used for filling.
4. In order to prevent the possibility of the cross-flow towards the earthen embankments, it is necessary to provide _____________________
a) counter berms
b) sides walls of sufficient height and length
c) spoil banks
d) sufficient freeboard
b
5. Sloughing is the process of _________________
a) progressive erosion
b) subsequent removal of soil grains from within the dam
c) uncontrolled seepage through the dam body
d) progressive removal of soil from the D/s face
d
6. In foundation slide failure___________________________
a) top of embankment gets cracked and lower slope moves outward forming large mud waves near the heel
b) top of embankment gets cracked and lower slope moves inward forming large mud waves near the heel
c) bottom of embankment gets cracked and lower slope moves outward forming large mud waves near the heel
d) bottom of embankment gets cracked and lower slope moves inward forming large mud waves near the heel
a
7. What is the most critical condition of slide of the U/s slope?
a) The sudden drawdown of the reservoir
b) Reservoir full condition
c) Steady seepage condition
d) Sudden drawdown and reservoir full condition
a
8. When the reservoir is full, the slope which is most likely to slide is _____________________
a) the upstream slope
b) the downstream slope
c) both upstream and downstream slope
d) no effect
b
9. In order to keep the saturation line in a canal embankment well within the toe, it is necessary to provide _____________________
a) spoil bank
b) counter berm
c) freeboard
d) berm
b
10. Which of the following failures generally occur due to the development of unaccounted pore pressures?
a) Hydraulic failures
b) Piping through the dam body
c) Sliding in embankments
d) Sloughing of the d/s toe
c
