1. The line joining the static water levels in several wells excavated through a confined aquifer is known as the _____________
a) cone of depression
b) piezometric surface
c) perched water-table
d) hypsometric curve
b
2. The permeability of an aquifer (m/day) will ____________
a) increase with an increase in temperature of water flowing through the aquifer
b) decrease with an increase in temperature of water flowing through the aquifer
c) not get affected by the change in temperature of water flowing through the aquifer
d) increase up to 20°C and then decreases with the increase in the temperature of water flowing through the aquifer
a
3. The discharge per unit drawdown at a well is known as ___________
a) specific yield
b) specific retention
c) specific capacity
d) specific storage
c
4. Coefficient of storage (A) has the dimensions of _____
a) L3
b) L
c) L2
d) Dimensionless
d
5. The units of specific capacity of a well are _____
a) m3/sec
b) m2/sec
c) m/sec
d) no units
b
Specific capacity = discharge of the well / Drawdown = Q / (C1Q + C2Q2) = m3/sec/m = m2/sec. This equation also shows that the specific capacity of the well is not constant but decreases as the discharge increases.

6. Specific yield for an unconfined aquifer is ________________
a) greater than porosity
b) less than porosity
c) equal to porosity
d) unrelated to porosity
b
7. A perched aquifer is found within ____________
a) unconfined aquifer
b) confined aquifer
c) aquiclude
d) both confined and unconfined aquifer
a
8. The specific capacity of a confined well under equilibrium condition and within the working limits of drawdown ______________
a) is constant at all drawdowns
b) decreases as the drawdown are increased
c) increases as the drawdown are increased
d) may increase or decrease
b
Specific capacity = Q/(C1.Q + C2.Q2). i.e. Discharge/ Drawdown (Well loss + Aquifer loss).
9. The standard specific capacity of a well is the well-discharge per unit of drawdown. This value of discharge should be obtained at ________
a) any drawdown
b) a particular drawdown of 3 m
c) the first 1 m of drawdown
d) the first 2 m of drawdown
c
10. An example of aquitard stratum in the ground profile is a layer of ___________
a) granite rock
b) clay
c) sandy clay
d) sandstone
c
11. An aquifer which is confined at its bottom but not at the top is called ___________
a) semi-confined aquifer
b) confined aquifer
c) unconfined aquifer
d) artesian aquifer
c
12. The clogging of well screens and consequent reduction in pump efficiency is indicated by _____________
a) the high value of the well-loss
b) the low value of the well-loss
c) variable value of the well-loss
d) both high and low value of the well-loss
