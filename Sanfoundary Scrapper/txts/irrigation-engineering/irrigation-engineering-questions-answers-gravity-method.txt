1. When the reservoir is empty, the single force acting on it is the self-weight of the dam which acts at a distance of ____________
a) B/2 from the heel
b) B/6 from the heel
c) B/3 from the heel
d) B/4 from the heel
c
2. When the reservoir is empty, the maximum vertical stress equal to ________________
a) At heel = 2W/B and at toe = 0
b) At heel = 0 and at toe = 2W/B
c) At heel = toe = zero
d) At heel = toe = 2W/B
a
Pmax/min = V/B [1 + 6e/B] and V/B [1 – 6e/B] where e = B/6 and V = total vertical force = weight W
Pmax = 2W/B and Pmin = 0.
The maximum vertical stress at the heel is equal to 2W/B and at the toe is zero.
3. The two-dimensional stability analysis of gravity dams proves better for U-shaped valleys than for V-shaped valleys.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Calculate the value of minimum base width for an elementary triangular concrete gravity dam supporting 72 m height of reservoir water and full uplift? (Take specific gravity of concrete as 2.4 and coefficient of friction as 0.7)
a) 36.28 m
b) 39.77 m
c) 51.5 m
d) 73.5 m
d
Case 1: B = H / (Sc – c)1/2 (For full uplift c = 1 and specific gravity of concrete = 2.4 )
= 72/ (2.4 – 1)1/2 = 60.85 m
Case 2: B = H/μ (S – 1) where μ = coefficient of friction taken as 0.7
B = 72 / 0.7 x 1.4 = 73.46 m
The highest among the two base width value is to be selected i.e. B = 73.46 m.
5. For usual values of permissible compressive stress and specific gravity of concrete, a high concrete gravity is the one whose height exceeds ______________
a) 48 m
b) 70 m
c) 88 m
d) 98 m
c
Hmax = 3000/[(2.4 + 1) x 9.81] = 89.9 m.
6. For triangular dam section of height H for just no tension under the action of water pressure, self-weight and uplift pressure, the minimum base width required is _____________
a) H / (S-1)
b) H / S1/2
c) H / (S – 1)-1
d) H / (S-1)1/2
d
B = H / (S – 1)-1 where S is specific gravity of concrete and H is the height of water.
If uplift is not considered – B = H/S1/2.
7. If the eccentricity of the resultant falls outside the middle third, the ultimate failure of the dam occurs by ______________
a) tension
b) crushing
c) sliding
d) overturning
a
8. What is the value of eccentricity for no tension condition in the dam?
a) e < B/6
b) e > B/6
c) e > B/3
d) e < B/3
a
9. What is the formula for limiting height of a gravity dam?
a) Hmax = f / (Sc + 1) γw
b) Hmax = f / (Sc – 1) γw
c) Hmax = f / (Sc + C) γw
d) Hmax = f / (Sc – 1) γw
a
Hmax = f / (Sc + 1) γw where f = allowable stress of the dam material, Sc = Specific gravity of concrete and γw = unit weight of water.
This limiting height draws a dividing line between a low gravity dam and a high gravity dam.
10. Calculate the top width of the dam if the height of water stored is 84m.
a) 5 m
b) 2.5 m
c) 5.55 m
d) 7.75 m
a
A = 0.522 H1/2 = 0.522 x 841/2 = 5.05 m.
As per Creager, the economical top width has been found to be equal to 14% of the dam height without considering earthquake forces.
