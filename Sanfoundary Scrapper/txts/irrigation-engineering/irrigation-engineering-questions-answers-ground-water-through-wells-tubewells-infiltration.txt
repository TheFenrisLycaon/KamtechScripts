1. The field measurement of infiltration is done by ____________________
a) potentiometer
b) lysimeter
c) infiltrometer
d) tensiometer
c

5. Rate of infiltration determined by infiltrometer is less than the one determined by rainfall simulator.
a) True
b) False
b
6. Deep vertical movement of water in the ground is called as ____________________
a) infiltration
b) percolation
c) runoff
d) seepage
b
7. Vegetation cover or grass-cover _____________
a) increases the field capacity
b) decreases the field capacity
c) may increase or decrease the field capacity
d) have no effect on field capacity
a
8. What is the correct expression of Horton’s equation?
a) ft = fC + (fC – fO) e-K.t
b) ft = fC + (fC – fO) eK.t
c) ft = fC + (fO – fC) eK.t
d) ft = fC + (fO – fC) e-K.t
d
ft = fC + (fO – fC) e-K.t
Where fC = final constant rate of infiltration at saturation, fO = initial rate of infiltration capacity, k is the decay constant depending upon soil and vegetation and t = time from the beginning of the storm.
