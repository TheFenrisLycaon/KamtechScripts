a
11. If the specific speed in revolution per minute of a turbine is in between 60 to 300, the type of the turbine is ________________
a) Pelton turbine
b) Francis turbine
c) Propeller turbine
d) Kaplan turbine
b
12. A draft tube is essentially required for impulse type turbines.
a) True
b) False
b
13. Pick the correct choice of turbine required to generate 10,000 HP under a head of 81 m while working at a speed of 500 rpm.
a) Pelton
b) Kaplan
c) Bulb
d) Francis
d
Where, N = the normal speed of turbine = 500 rpm
Pt = Turbine output in metric horsepower = 10,000 hp
H = effective head = 81 m
Ns = 500 x 100 / 815/4 = 205.76 rpm.
The turbine which is suitable for a head between 25 to 150 m and Ns of 60 – 300 is Francis turbine i.e reaction type turbine.

b) ii and iii
c) i and iv
d) ii and iv
b
15. The Pumps in series operation allow the head to increase and the pumps in parallel operation increase the flow rate.
