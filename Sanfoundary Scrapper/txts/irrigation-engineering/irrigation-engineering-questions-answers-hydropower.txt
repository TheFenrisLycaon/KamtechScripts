1. The minimum power which a hydropower plant can generate throughout the year is called as ________________
a) power plant capacity
b) power plant load
c) firm power
d) water power
c
2. If the peak load for a power plant equals the plant capacity then the ratio of the capacity factor to load factor will be _________________
a) 1
b) 0
c) < 1
d) > 1
a
Capacity factor = Average load over a given time period / Plant capacity
Since, Plant capacity = Peak load
Ratio of CF / LF = 1.
3. If the peak load on a power plant having a capacity of 100 MW is 70 MW during a given week and the energy produced is 58, 80,000 kWh, the capacity factor for the plant for the week will be ___________________
a) 35%
b) 50%
c) 70%
d) 65%
a
Average load = Energy produced / Time (in hours) = 58,80,000 / 7 x 24 = 35000 kW
C.F = 35 MW / 100 MW = 0.35 (or 35%).
4. During a certain week a power plant turns out 84,00,000 kWh and the peak load during the week is 100,000 kW. What is the load factor during the week?
a) 40%
b) 45%
c) 50%
d) 60%
c
Average load = 84,000,000 / (24 x 7) = 50,000 kW
L.F = Average load / Peak load = 50,000 / 100,000 = 0.5 or 50%.
5. A canal drop is 6 meters and discharges available through the turbine is 50 cumec. Find the electrical energy available.
a) 2352 KW
b) 2352 MW
c) 2.352 kW
d) 235.2 kW
a
Electrical energy = 7.84 x 50 x 6 = 2352 kW.
6. The ratio of maximum power utilised to the maximum power available is _____________
a) power factor
b) plant use factor
c) reserve capacity
d) capacity factor
b
7. The net amount of power which is continuously available from a plant without any break is known as _____________
a) firm power
b) secondary power
c) power factor
d) utilization factor
a
8. The value of power factor is generally _____________________
a) equal to unity
b) less than unity
c) greater than unity
d) equal to zero
b
9. To ensure maximum overall plant efficiency, the rated head should be equal to ______________
a) the design head
b) the gross head
c) the operating head
d) effective head
a
10. The difference of head at the point of entry and exit of turbine is _______________
a) design head
b) gross head
c) effective head
d) rated head
c
11. The load on a hydel plant varies from a minimum of 10,000 kW to a maximum of 35,000 kW. Two turbo-generators of capacities 20,000 kW each have been installed. Calculate Plant factor.
a) 50%
b) 51%
c) 56.2%
d) 59.7%
c
Since two turbo generators are installed, the total installed capacity = 40000 kW
P.F = [(10000 + 35000) / 2] / 40000 = 56%.
12. Calculate utilisation factor if the maximum power utilised is 40,000 kW and two turbo generators installed each of capacity 23,000 kW.
a) 73%
b) 87%
c) 57.5%
d) 63%
b
U.F = 40,000 / (2 x 23000) = 86.9% (since two generators are installed).
13. If the peak load on a power plant having a capacity of 100 MW is 70 MW during a given week. Calculate the utilization factor.
a) 0.35
b) 0.50
c) 0.70
d) 0.60
c
U.F = Max power utilised/ Max power available = 70 / 100 = 0.7.
14. 400 cumecs of water are being released from dam storage to meet the downstream demand through the turbines of the connected hydro plant. The effective head of water acting on the turbines is 50 m. The efficiency of the hydro plant is 0.8. The electrical power generated from this plant is __________________
a) 1,56,800 MW
b) 156.8 M kW
c) 156.8 MW
d) 156.8 kW
c
Electrical energy = 7.84 x 400 x 50 = 1, 56,800 kW = 156.80 MW.
15. What is the highest elevation of water level that can be maintained in the reservoir without any spillway discharge either with gated or non-gated spillway?
a) Normal Water level
b) Minimum Water level
c) Weighted average level
d) Operating head
a
