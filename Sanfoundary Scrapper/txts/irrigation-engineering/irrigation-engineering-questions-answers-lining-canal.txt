5. Design a lined canal carrying a discharge of 20 cumecs. The slope is 1 in 7000. Assume suitable values for side slopes and lining.
a) Side Slope = 1.2: 1, Depth = 4.4 m
b) Side Slope = 1.4: 1, Depth = 4.1 m
c) Side Slope = 1.5: 1, Depth = 3.77 m
d) Side Slope = 1.3: 1, Depth = 4.5 m
c
Now let us design a triangular section.
A = y2 (θ + cotθ), P = 2y(θ + cotθ), and R = A/P = y/2
Tanθ = (1/1.5) and cotθ = 1.5 and θ = 0.59
A = y2 (0.59 + 1.5) = y2 (2.09)
P = 2 y (0.59 + 1.5) = y (4.18)
R = 0.5y
Now Manning’s equation gives
Q = 1/n x A x R2/3 x S1/2
20 = (1/0.015) x y2 (2.09) x (0.5y) 2/3 x (1/7000)1/2
y= 3.02 m
Freeboard = 0.75 m
Total depth = 3.02 + 0.75 = 3.77 m and side slope = 1.5 : 1
6. Design a lined canal to carry a discharge of 400 cumecs and slope is 1 in 6000. Take side slopes as 1 : 1 and rugosity constant as 0.012. Assume limiting velocity as 3 m/sec.
a) Total Depth = 6.3 m, Bed Width = 15 m
b) Total Depth = 6.28 m, Bed Width = 14.2 m
c) Total Depth = 6.5 m, Bed Width = 14 m
d) Total Depth = 6.25 m, Bed Width = 14.4 m
d
3 = (1/0.012) x R2/3 x (1/6000)1/2
R = 4.7 m
Design a trapezoidal section canal.
A = y (B + yθ + y cotθ), P = B + 2yθ + 2y cotθ
Now Tanθ = 1/1, θ = 0.785 radians, and cotθ = 1
Now A = y (B + y x 0.785 + y x 1) = y(B + 1.785y), P = B + 2y(0.785) + 2y(1) = B + 2.57y
A = Q/V = 400/3 = 133.33 sq.m
100 = y (B +1.785y), B = 100/y – 1.785y
R = A/P = 133.33/P
4.7 = 133.33/B + 2.57Y
y= 5.5 m
B = 14.4 m
Total Depth = 5.5 + 0.75 = 6.25 m
Bed Width = 14.4 m.
