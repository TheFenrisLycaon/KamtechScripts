0.056. Yw. d. (Gs – 1) >or = Yw. R. S where, for sand of gravel Gs = 2.65
d >or = 10.82 R.S
d >or = 11 R.S.

a) 0.025 m
b) 0.035 m
c) 0.055 m
d) 0.1 m
a
n = 0.051/6/24 = 0.025 m.
8. The manning’s coefficient for a lined trapezoidal channel with a bed slope of 1 in 4000 is 0.014 and it will be 0.028 if the channel is unlined. The area in the case of the lined section is 19.04 m2 and for the unlined section is 29.09 m2. What percentage of earthwork is saved in a lined section relative to an unlined section, when a hydraulically efficient section is used in both the cases?
a) 24.44 %
b) 34.55%
c) 50%
d) 37.66%
b
= (29.09 – 19.04) / 29.09 x 100
= 34.55%.
9. Calculate the critical tractive stress if the median diameter of the sand bed is 1.0 mm.
a) 0.53 N/m2
b) 0.61 N/m2
c) 0.73 N/m2
d) 1.61 N/m2
a
Tc = 0.155 + [0.409 d2/(1 + 0.177 d2)0.5] 
= 0.155 + [0.409 x 12/(1 + 0.177 x 12)0.5] = 0.53 N/m2.
10. Calculate the ratio of the tractive critical stress to the average shear stress if the water flows at a depth of 0.8 m in a wide stream having a bed slope of 1 in 3000. The median diameter of the sand bed is 2 mm.
a) 0.53
b) 1.86
c) 0.86
d) 1.53
a
Tc = 0.155 + [0.409 d2/(1 + 0.177 d2)0.5] 
= 0.155 + [0.409 x 22/(1 + 0.177 x 22)0.5] = 1.40 N/m2.
The average shear stress = Yw. RS = 9.81 x 0.8 x 1/3000 = 2.616 N/m2
Ratio = 1.40/2.616 = 0.53.
11. Determine the shear stress required to move the single grain on the side slopes, if the critical shear stress required moving the similar grain on the horizontal bed is 2.91 N/m2. Consider the angle of the side slope with the horizontal as 30° and the angle of repose of soil as 37°.
a) 1.61 N/m2
b) 2.61 N/m2
c) 2.91 N/m2
d) 1.00 N/m2
a
Tc’ = (1 – Sin230°/Sin237°)1/2x 2.91 = 1.61 N/m2.
12. The shear stress required to move grain on the side slopes is less than the shear stress required to move the grain on the canal bed.
a) True
b) False
a
Tc’ = {(1 – Sin2Q/Sin2R)1/2.Tc } where Tc’ = shear stress on the side slopes, Tc = shear stress on the horizontal bed, Q = Angle of side slope with the horizontal, and R = angle of repose of the soil.
