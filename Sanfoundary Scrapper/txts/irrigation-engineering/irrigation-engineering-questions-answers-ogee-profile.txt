1. The discharge passing over an ogee spillway per unit length of its apex line is proportional ___________________
a) H
b) H2
c) H1/2
d) H3/2
d
Q = C. Le. H3/2 where Le is the effective length of the spillway crest, C is the coefficient of discharge and H is the total head over the crest including the velocity head.
It is clear from the discharge equation that the discharge is proportional to H3/2.
2. When the crest of an ogee spillway is designed to be in accordance with the lower nappe of a free-falling water jet over a duly ventilated sharp-crested weir then theoretically
a) The pressure on the spillway crest will be zero at design head only
b) The pressure on the spillway crest will always be zero
c) The pressure on the spillway crest will always be negative
d) The pressure on the spillway crest will be always positive
a
3. When the gated sluices are provided through the body of the dam spillway then the ogee spillway structure shall normally be of Corbel type.
a) True
b) False
b
4. The velocity of approach has found to be negligible effect upon discharge if ____________
a) the ratio H/Hd is more than 1.33
b) the ratio H/Hd is less than 1.33
c) the ratio H/Hd is equal to zero
d) the ratio H/Hd is more than 1
a
5. If a flood enters a dam reservoir at F.R.L, the efficiency of its ogee spillway will ______________
a) increase with the increasing head
b) reduce with the increasing head
c) remain constant with the increasing head
d) vary with the increasing head
a
6. The downstream apron of the ogee spillway is found to have a negligible effect on the coefficient of discharge when the value of ________________
a) (Hd + d) / He is less than 1.7
b) (Hd + d) / He exceeds 1.7
c) (Hd + d) / He is equal to 1
d) (Hd + d) / He is less than 1.33
b
7. What is the value of the pier abutment coefficient for pointed nose piers?
a) 0.1
b) 0.02
c) 0.01
d) 0.0
d
S.NO.
Pier Shape
Contraction Coefficient
1
Square nosed piers without any rounding
0.1
2
Rounded nose piers and 900 cut water nosed piers
0.01
3
Pointed nose piers
0.0
8. What is the value of abutment contraction coefficient for square abutment with headwall perpendicular to the direction of flow?
a) 0.2
b) 0.1
c) 0.02
d) 0.01
a
9. What is the assumption that is taken during the entire design of an overflow spillway?
a) The upper and lower nappe is subjected to negative pressures
b) The upper and lower nappe is subjected to full atmospheric pressure
c) The upper and lower nappe is subjected to zero atmospheric pressure
d) The upper and lower nappe is subjected to both positive and negative pressure
b
10. The greater is the divergence from the streamline flow, greater is the contraction coefficient.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Calculate the effective length of the spillway which consists of 6 spans having a clear width of 10 m each. The thickness of each pier may be taken as 2.5 m and the total design head on the crest including velocity head is 16.3 m. Assuming 90° cut water nose piers and rounded abutments.
a) 55 m
b) 60 m
c) 65 m
d) 75 m
a
Le = L – 2[N.Kp + Ka].H
Where  L = clear length of the spillway crest = 6 x 10 = 60, N = Number of piers = 5 and H = 16.3 m
For 90° cut water nose piers and rounded abutments; Ka = 0.1 and Kp = 0.01
Le = 60 – 2[5 x 0.01 + 0.1] x 16.3 = 55.1 m.
