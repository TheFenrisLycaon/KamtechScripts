1. The value of consumptive use may be different for different crops and different for the same crop at different times and places.
a) True
b) False
a
2. What is the process of a plant called, through which it leaves water?
a) Photosynthesis
b) Transpiration
c) Evapotranspiration
d) Chlorosis
b
3. Transpiration process is an integral part of the main process called photosynthesis.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Which protein in the leaf of the plant utilize carbon dioxide and produce carbohydrates?
a) Chloroplasts
b) Stomata
c) Xylene
d) Leaf
a
5. Total transpiration about 95% occurs during the day alone.
a) True
b) False
a
6. On which factor does the transpiration loss also depends on?
a) Available Moisture
b) Type of Soil
c) Type of Irrigation
d) Method of Irrigation
a
7. On what factor does transpiration ratio depends on?
a) Water
b) Soil
c) Air
d) Moisture
a
8. In transpiration ratio what type of crop is considered to be weighed, for mass of dry matter produced?
a) Marketed Crop
b) Cash Crop
c) Horticulture Crop
d) Plantation Crop
a
9. Given information is that total mass of water required for the growth of a plant is 285 kgs, and mass of the marketed crop is 19 kgs. Find the transpiration ratio?
a) 12
b) 16
c) 25
d) 15
d
= (285/19)
= 15.
10. A crop is being tested in the lab to its loss due to transpiration. Given that initial weight of instrument is 100 kgs, and final mass of instrument is 150 kgs. The amount of water added during full growth of plant is 70 kgs. Find the loss due transpiration when the method used is phytometer method?
a) 20 kgs
b) 15 kgs
c) 25 kgs
d) 10 kgs
a
= (M1 + M) – (M2)
M1 = initial mass of instrument
M = mass of water added during full growth of plant
M2 = final mass of instrument
Therefore (T) = (100 + 70) – 150 = 170 – 150 = 20 kgs.
11. By what number should the value from the phytometer method be multiplied when it comes to obtain possible field results?
a) 5
b) 6
c) 9
d) A Constant Number
d
12. Which type of soil has less ratio of AET/PET than the other?
a) Clayey Soil
b) Sandy Soil
c) Alluvial Soil
d) Black Soil
b
13. On what factors Potential Evapotranspiration critically depends?
a) Climatological Factors
b) Types of Crop
c) Types of Soils
d) Vegetation
a
14. On what factors Actual Evapotranspiration depends?
a) Climatological Factors
b) Types of Crop
c) Types of Soils
d) Characteristics of Soil and Vegetation
d
15. Which type of method is adopted for research studies on crops?
a) Phytometer Method
b) Lysimeter Method
c) Furrow Irrigation Method
d) Drip Irrigation Method
b
