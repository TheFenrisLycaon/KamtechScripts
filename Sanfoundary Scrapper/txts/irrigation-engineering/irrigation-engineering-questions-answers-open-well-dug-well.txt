1. The rate of water contribution to the well increases with the increase in the depression head.
a) True
b) False
a
2. The performance of a well is measured by its ________
a) specific capacity
b) specific yield
c) storage coefficient
d) permeability coefficient
a
3. The safe depression head for open wells is generally taken to be x times the critical depression head when x is ______
a) 1/6
b) 1/3
c) 1/2
d) 3/4
b
4. The yield of a well depends on ________________
a) permeability of soil
b) area of aquifer opening into the wells
c) actual flow velocity
d) permeability and actual flow velocity
a
5. Which type of open well is suitable when the sub-soil is formed of gravel or coarse sand deposits?
a) Unlined wells
b) Wells with pervious lining
c) Wells with impervious lining
d) Temporary wells
b
6. Depending upon the type of sub-soil formation, the construction of well is done in two ways i.e. Dug wells and Sunk wells. Dug wells are constructed in soft formations.
a) True
b) False
b
7. A well 3 meters in diameter has its normal water level 3 meters below the ground level. By pumping water level in the well is depressed to 10 meters below the ground level. In 4 hours the water rises by 5 meters. Calculate the specific yield of the well.
a) 2.213 m3/hr
b) 5 m3/hr
c) 1.242 m3/hr
d) 3.224 m3/hr
a
Given values, A = 3.14/4 x 9 = 7.065 sq. m, T = 4 hours, H1 = 7m, H2 = 2m
K = 2.303 x 7.065 x 1/4 x log (7/2) = 2.213 m3/hr under a head of one meter.
8. An open well is called shallow well when ____________
a) the depth of well is small
b) the water table is high
c) it does not encounter mota formation
d) it finds the foundation in the mota formation
c
9. Open well has big diameter than tube well because ____________
i. Open well has to irrigate more area.
ii. Water contribution to the well is natural and therefore, the percolation area has to be more.
iii. Storage of water has to be made before irrigation is done.
a) i and ii
b) i and iii
c) ii and iii
d) i, ii and iii
c
10. If the sub-soil formation is of fine sand, the rough value of the specific yield of well per unit area of the well (K/A) given by Marriot is ____________
a) 0.25
b) 0.50
c) 0.75
d) 1.0
b
11. Which of the following method of lifting water is very suitable when the depth of well is from 12 to 20 meters?
a) Denkli
b) Churus
c) Persian wheel
d) Windmill
c
12. Mota layer sometimes is also known as Marbarwa or Magasan is an impervious layer.
a) True
b) False
a
13. A well is to be constructed in a fine sandy sub-soil formation. The discharge of the well under the depression head of 4 m is 0.004 m3/sec. Calculate the diameter of the well.
a) 2 m
b) 2.5 m
c) 3 m
d) 3.5 m
c
Q or yield = K x H
14.4 = K x 4 or K = 3.6 m3/hour under head of 1 meter.
From Marriot’s table, the value of K/A for sandy sub-soil formation = 0.5
3.6/A = 0.5 or A = 7.2 m2
Diameter of well = (A x 4/3.14)1/2 = 3.07 m.
