1. The flow through the penstocks and pressure conduits is generally ____________________
a) laminar
b) turbulent
c) both laminar and turbulent
d) unpredictable
b
2. The head loss in the flow of water through a penstock pipe of given length ____________
a) increases with the increase in flow velocity
b) decreases with the increase in flow velocity
c) decreases with the increase in the roughness of the pipe surface
d) decreases with time
a
HL = f’. V2. L / 2gd where L is the length of pipe in meters, d is the diameter of the pipe, V is the velocity of the pipe and f’ is the friction factor which depends on Reynold’s number and the relative roughness of the pipe.
It is clear from the given equation that the head loss is directly proportional to the length of the pipe hence the head loss increases with the increase in the length of the pipe.
3. Hoop’s reinforcement is provided in cement concrete pressure pipes in order to counteract the _________
a) water hammer pressure
b) internal hammer pressure
c) stresses caused by the external backfills
d) both water hammer pressure and internal hammer pressure
d
T1 = p1 d/2t where p1 is the internal static pressure, d is the diameter of the pipe and t is the thickness of the pipe shell.
Similarly, the circumferential tensile stress caused by water hammer pressure is given by –
T2 = p2 d/2t where p2 is the maximum water hammer pressure developed in pipelines.
4. The more rapid the closure of the valve, greater is the water hammer pressure developed.
a) True
b) False
a
5. Which of the following types of pressure conduits is preferably used for large heads?
a) PCC pipes
b) Cast iron pipes
c) Pre-stressed concrete pipes
d) Asbestos pipes
c
6. Which head loss formula is also applicable to turbulent flow in pressure conduits?
a) Darch-Weisbach equation
b) Manning’s formula
c) Hazen-Williams formula
d) Both Darch-Weisbach and Manning’s formula
b
HL = n2. V2. L / R4/3 where, n = manning’s rugosity coefficient, L is the length of pipe, V is the flow velocity through pipe and R is the hydraulic mean depth of the pipe.
7. __________________ joint is often used for connecting cast iron pipes.
a) Flexible joint
b) Expansion joint
c) Collar joints
d) Bell and spigot joint
d
8. Which of the following conduits is used when large diameter pipes of smaller wall thickness are required?
a) Cast iron conduits
b) Galvanized steel pipes
c) Hume steel conduits
d) Centrifugal type RCC pipe
b
9. A special flexible joint called simplex joint is generally used to join _______________
a) vitrified clay conduits
b) galvanised iron pipes
c) asbestos conduits
d) hume steel conduits
c
10. Which of the following statement is incorrect?
a) Steel conduits are lighter than cast iron pipes
b) RCC pipes are generally made from 1:2:4 cement concrete with a maximum size of aggregates as 6 mm
c) RCC pipes and Hume steel conduits are heavy and difficult to handle
d) Riveted pipes are smoother and stronger than welded pipes
d
11. Which of the following pipes is used for carrying hot water in the interior of the building?
a) Wrought iron pipes
b) Copper pipes
c) Galvanised iron pipes
d) Plastic pipes
b
12. Wrought iron pipes are heavier than cast iron pipes and cannot be easily fabricated.
a) True
b) False
b
