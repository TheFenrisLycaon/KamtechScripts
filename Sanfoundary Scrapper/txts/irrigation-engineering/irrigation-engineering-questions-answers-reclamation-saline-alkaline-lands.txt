b) sodic Soils
c) saline-alkali soils
d) saline soils
d
8. A soil sample has an Exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) of 16%, its electrical conductivity is 3.2 Milli-Mohs/cm and a pH of 9.5. How is the soil classified?
a) Saline soil
b) Saline-alkaline soil
c) Alkaline soil
d) Non-saline soil
c
9. What are the three classes of salty soil?
a) Saline soil, Saline-alkali soil, Non-saline soil
b) Saline soil, Alkali soil, Non-saline soil
c) Saline soil, Alkali soil, Saline-alkali soil
d) Alkali soil, Non-saline soil, Saline-alkali soil
c
i. Saline or white alkali or solonchak soil- High soluble salts and low ESP
ii. Alkali or Sodic or black alkali soil – Low salt content but high ESP
iii. Saline-alkali soils – High salt content and High ESP.
10. What is Solonetz soil?
a) White alkali soil
b) Black alkali soil
c) Highly saline soil
d) Non-saline soil
b
11. Estimate the leaching requirement when electrical conductivity (EC) value of a saturated extract of soil is 10 m mho/cm at 25% reduction in the yield of the crop. The EC of irrigation water is 1.5 m mho/cm.
a) 15%
b) 6.66%
c) 7.5%
d) 10%
c
E.C value of saturated soil = 10 milli-mhos/cm and E.C value of irrigation water = 1.2 milli-mhos/cm.
The EC of leaching water is assumed to be twice the EC value of saturation soil extract i.e. = 2 x 10 = 20 milli-mhos/cm
L.R = EC of irrigation water / EC of leaching water = 1.5 / 20 x 100%
L.R = 7.5%.
12. The higher the concentration of sodium present in the irrigation water, the lower is the risk.
a) True
b) False
b
