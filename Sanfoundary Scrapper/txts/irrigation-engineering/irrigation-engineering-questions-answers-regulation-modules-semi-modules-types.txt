1. Which of the following is not a type of semi-modules?
a) Free pipe outlet
b) Kennedy’s Gauge outlet
c) Open flume outlet
d) Gibb’s module
d
2. Which of the following is the simplest and the oldest type of a flexible outlet?
a) Kennedy’s gauge outlet
b) Open flume outlet
c) Free pipe outlet
d) Adjustable orifice semi-module
c
3. Calculate full supply discharge for a free pipe outlet for the following data.
Head on the upstream side above the centre line of pipe = 0.55 m
Coefficient of discharge = 0.62
The diameter of the pipe = 25 cm
a) 8 lit/sec
b) 9 lit/sec
c) 0.9 lit/sec
d) 9 cumecs
b
Q = Cd. A. (2gH)1/2 where H is the head on U/s side measured from FSL of distributary up to the centre of pipe outlet and A is the area of cross-section of the pipe.
Q = 0.62 x [3.14/4 x 0.25 x 0.25] x (2 x 9.81 x 0.55)1/2
Q = 0.09 cumecs or 9 lit/sec.
4. Which module is mostly adopted and is considered to be the best of all the modules?
a) Adjustable orifice semi-module
b) Open flume outlet
c) Venturi-flume outlet
d) Free pipe outlet
a
5. Calculate the minimum modular head loss involved in ASOM if the head measured from the upstream water level in the distributary is 1.5 m and the width of the throat as 0.16 m.
a) 1.50 m
b) 1.15 m
c) 1.07 m
d) 1.00 m
b
HL = 0.82 HS – W/2 where HS = Head measured from the U/s level in the distributary to the lowest point of the roof block and W = width of the throat
HL = (0.82 x 1.5) – 0.08 = 1.15 m.
6. The proportionality of APM was sacrificed to enable the outlet to carry higher silt charge by increasing the setting to 8/10.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Calculate the discharge through an open flume outlet for the following data:
Coefficient of discharge = 1.71
Width of the throat = 0.15 m
Head over the crest measured from FSL of distributary = 1.8 m
a) 0.62 cumecs
b) 0.82 cumecs
c) 0.62 lit/sec
d) 6.2 lit/sec
a
Q = Cd. W H3/2 where W = 0.15 m, Cd = 1.71 and H = 1.8 m
Q = 1.71 x 0.15 x 1.83/2 = 0.62 cumecs.
8. The only irrigation semi-module through which the discharge is not proportional to H1/2 where H is the head causing flow through the module is _____________
a) kennedy’s gauge outlet
b) open flume outlet
c) free pipe outlet
d) adjustable orifice semi-module
b
Q = Cd. A. (2gH)1/2 where H is the head on U/s side measured from FSL of distributary up to the centre of pipe outlet, Cd is the coefficient of discharge, and A is the area of cross-section of the pipe.
The discharge through an open flume outlet is given as: Q = Cd. W H3/2 where W is the width of the throat.
The discharge through AOSM is given by- Q = Cd. (W. y0).(2gH)1/2 where ‘y0’ is the height of an orifice opening.
9. An irrigation outlet is said to be proportional, when its ______________
a) Setting = outlet index/ channel index
b) Setting = channel index/ outlet index
c) Setting = channel index x outlet index
d) Setting = channel index + Outlet index
a
10. The principal feature of an ASOM is similar to those of a flume regulator.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Choose the incorrect advantage of AOSM.
a) The adjustment can be made by raising or lowering the roof blocks at low costs by dismantling the masonry in which the roof bolts are fixed
b) Any undue tampering of roof blocks by the cultivators can be easily detected
c) The module is not perfectly rigid
d) It is the most simple and cheaper outlet
c
12. For a wide trapezoidal channel, the channel index is ______
a) 2/3
b) 5/3
c) 4/3
d) 1/3
b
