a) higher
b) lower
c) equal
d) lower or higher as per designers discretion
b
3. Yield of a reservoir represents ___________________
a) the inflow into the reservoir
b) the capacity of the reservoir
c) the outflow demand on the reservoir
d) the optimum value of catchment yield
c
4. Design yield of a storage reservoir is kept _______________
a) higher than its firm or safe yield
b) lower than its firm or safe yield
c) equal to its firm or safe yield
d) higher or lower than the firm yield depending upon the designer’s intuition
b
5. Who did the first effort to give empirical relations for converting the yearly rainfall value into the yearly runoff for the given catchment?
a) Mr. W L Strange
b) Alexander Binnie
c) Mr. T.G Barlow
d) Sir Inglis
b
6. In which of the following method, the catchments were categorized as good, bad and average catchments to account for the general characteristics of the catchment?
a) Binnie’s percentages
b) Strange’s tables
c) Barlow’s tables
d) Inglis formula
b
7. What is the value of Barlow’s runoff percentage (K) for hills and plains with little cultivation?
a) 10
b) 15
c) 20
d) 25
d
8. What is the value of Lacey’s monsoon duration factor for a good year?
a) 0.5
b) 1.2
c) 1.5
d) 1.8
c
9. Which of the following yield formula is used for the catchments of West Maharashtra state of India?
a) Inglis formula
b) Khosla’s formula
c) Lacey’s formula
d) Barlow’s table
a
10. Which of the following formula for calculating yield can be applied to all catchments?
a) Inglis formula
b) Khosla’s formula
c) Lacey’s formula
d) Barlow’s table
b
Yield (Q) = P – 0.48 Tm where Q = the yield in cm, P = rainfall in cm, and Tm = mean annual temperature of the area.
11. According to the Inglis formula, the non-ghat areas are the one where rainfall is _____________
a) 200 cm or more
b) 200 cm or less
c) 100 cm or more
d) 100 cm or less
b
For ghat areas, Yield = (0.85P – 30.48)
For non-ghat areas, Yield = [P (P – 17.78)] / 254 where P is the rainfall in cm.
