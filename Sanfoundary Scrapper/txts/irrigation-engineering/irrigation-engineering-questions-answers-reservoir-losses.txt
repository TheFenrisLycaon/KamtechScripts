1. As the height of a proposed dam is increased, the cost per unit of storage initially increases and then decreases.
a) True
b) False
b
2. The economical height of a dam is that height for which the ____________________
a) cost per unit of storage is minimum
b) benefit-cost ratio is maximum
c) net benefits are maximum
d) benefit-cost ratio is minimum
a
3. If 20% of the reservoir capacity is earmarked for dead storage in a storage reservoir of 30 M.cum and the average annual silt deposition in the reservoir is 0.1 M cum, then the useful life of the reservoir will start reducing after ____________
a) 60 years
b) 120 years
c) 240 years
d) 300 years
a
Dead storage is 20% of the reservoir capacity = 0.2 x 30 = 6 M.cum
Time during which 6 M cum is filled by sediment @0.1 M.cum/yr = 6/0.1 = 60 years.
4. According to the Central Water Commission, the average annual evaporation loss is estimated to be _____________
a) 100 cm
b) 125 cm
c) 225 cm
d) 250 cm
c
