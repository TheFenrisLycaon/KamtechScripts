1. A land is said to be water-logged when _______________
a) the aeration is stopped in the root zone due to the rise in water content
b) there is a reduction in crop yield
c) there is an accumulation of alkali salts in the root zone of the crop
d) there is salinity in the soil
a
2. What is the pH range for strongly alkaline soils?
a) 7.4 – 7.8
b) 7.9 – 8.4
c) 8.5 – 9.0
d) > 9
c
Denomination
pH range
Slightly alkaline
7.4 – 7.8
Moderately alkaline
7.9 – 8.4
Strongly alkaline
8.5 – 9.0
Very strongly alkaline
> 9.0
3. Presence of excessive moisture retards the bacterial activities affecting crop growth.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Which of the following statement is wrong?
a) Seepage drains reduce the chances of water-logging
b) Untimely maturity of the crops is the characteristic of water-logged lands
c) The percolation loss can be reduced by keeping the intensity of irrigation low
d) There is no way to keep a watch over the problem of water-logging
d
5. The phenomenon of water-logging can be best understood with the help of a Hydrologic equation.
a) True
b) False
a
Inflow represents the amount of water that enters the sub-soil in various processes. The term outflow represents mainly evaporation from the soil, transpiration from plants, and underground drainage of the track. The term storage represents a change in the ground-water reservoir.
6. Swampy land is ________
a) ill-aerated land
b) the land where cultivation operations are impossible
c) land having deposition of alkali salts in the root zone of the crops
d) saline land
b
7. Salinity increases the osmotic activity of the plants.
a) True
b) False
b
8. Which of the following is a remedial measure for water-logging?
a) Controlling seepage from the canals
b) By lowering the F.S.L of the canals
c) Quick disposal of rainwater
d) Installation of lift irrigation systems
d
9. Which of the following factor do not contribute to water-logging?
a) Inadequate drainage
b) Seepage from unlined canals
c) Frequent flooding
d) Excessive tapping of groundwater
d
• Over and intensive irrigation
• Seepage of water through canals and adjoining high lands
• Inadequate natural drainage and surface drainage
• Excessive rains and submergence due to floods
• Impervious obstruction.
10. Which one of the following is not a remedial measure for waterlogging?
a) Good drainage for irrigated land
b) Conjunctive use of water in the basin
c) The lining of canals and watercourses
d) Contour bunding
d
• Canal lining
• Crop rotation and optimum use of water
• Provision of intercepting drains
• Reducing the intensity of irrigation
• Improving the natural drainage system and providing an efficient drainage system.
