6. Given that the bed slope of a channel is 1 in 2000 and the discharge is 60 cumecs. The depth of the channel is fixed and is given as 2 m. The tractive force needed for the movement of bedload is? Take critical velocity ratio as 1.1.
a) 8.89 N/m3
b) 8.87 N/m3
c) 8.85 N/m3
d) 8.83 N/m3
d
= 0.55 x 1.1 x (2)0.64
= 0.943 m/sec
Area = Q / Vo = 60 / 0.943 = 63.63 m2 (Given Q = 60 cumecs)
A = y (b + y (1/2)) (y = depth, b = base width)
63.63 = 2(b + 1) (for side slope as (1/2:1/2H:V))
b = 30.82 m
Perimeter (P) = b + √5y = 30.82 + 2 x √5
P = 35.3 m
R = A/P = 63.63 / 35.3 = 1.8 m (R = hydraulic mean depth)
Now, tractive force (τo) = γwRS = 9.81 x 103 x 1.8 x (1/2000) (γw = 9.81 x 103 N/m3)
= 8.83 N/m3.

b) Vapor State
c) Floods
d) Ice
c
9. What minimum value of shear stress is needed to move the sediment?
a) Critical Velocity Ratio
b) Critical Shear Stress
c) Critical Velocity
d) Drag Force
b
10. Design a channel carrying a 30 cumecs. The median grain diameter is taken as 0.5 mm. The bedload concentration is 60 p.p.m by weight. Use Lacey’s Regime perimeter and Meyer-peter’s formulas.
a) B = 26 m, S = 1/5600, y = 1.25 m
b) B = 22 m, S = 1/5800, y = 1.55 m
c) B = 24 m, S = 1/5500, y = 1.45 m
d) B = 25 m, S = 1/5700, y = 1.35 m
d
Quantity of bed load transported per second = 40/106 (30 x 9.81 x 1000) = 11.8 N/sec
Lacey’s Regime perimeter = 4.75 x √Q = 26.03 m
Let us take channel bed width (B) as 25 m
Bed load per unit width = gb = 11.8 / 25 = 0.472 N/m/sec
Meyer Peter equation –
gb = 0.417 x [τo(n’/n) – τc]3/2
n’ = (1/24) x (0.5)1/6
= 0.011
n = 0.02
n’/n = 0.55
τc = 0.687 x da = 0.687 x 0.5 = 0.3435 N/m2
gb = 0.417 [9.81 x 1000 x RS x (0.55)3/2 – 0.3435]3/2
RS = 0.0002
Manning’s equation –
Q = 1/n x R2/3 x S1/2
R2/3 x S1/2 = 0.6
S = 0.0002/R
S = 1/5700
R = 1.15 m
Now P = 25+y√5, A = 25y + y2/2 for trapezoidal channel of 1/2:1 slopes
R = A/P = (25+√5y)/ (25+y2/2) = 1.15
From this y = 1.35 m
Therefore B = 25 m, y = 1.35 m, S = 1/5700.
