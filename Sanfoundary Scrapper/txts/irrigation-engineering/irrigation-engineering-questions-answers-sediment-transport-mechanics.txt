1. The soil is assumed to be coherent in the study of the mechanism of sediment transport.
a) True
b) False
b
2. The basic mechanism behind the phenomenon of sediment transport is ______________
a) drag force opposite to the direction of the flow
b) drag force in the direction of the flow
c) free motion of the sediment particles
d) force exerted by water vertically
b
3. Which of the following statement is wrong?
a) Threshold condition is the one in which a few particles on the bed will just start moving
b) Knowledge of critical velocity helps in designing stable non-scouring channels
c) The critical tractive force approach helps in designing unstable channels in alluviums
d) The knowledge of threshold condition is required for the computation of sediment load
c
4. For the bed of the canal, the average shear stress is equal to the tractive force per unit area.
a) True
b) False
a
5. A wide unlined channel carrying silt-free water has a depth of 2.0 m. The maximum slope that can be given to a channel is 1 in 10,000. Calculate the maximum tractive stress permissible on the bed to prevent scouring.
a) 0.2 kg/m2
b) 1.962 kg/m2
c) 2 kg/m2
d) 1 kg/cm2
a
= 9.81 x 1000 x 2.0 x 10-4
= 1.962 kg/m2
6. The water flows at a depth of 0.6 m in a wide stream having a bed slope of 1 in 2500. The critical tractive stress is 0.53 N/m2. Determine the motion of soil grains and the average shear stress.
a) 2.35 N/m2 and soil grains will be stationary
b) 2.35 N/m2 and soil grains is in motion
c) 0.235 N/m2 and soil grains will be stationary
d) 0.235 N/m2 and soil grains is in motion
b
= 9.81 x 1000 x 0.6 x 1/2500 = 2.35 N/m2.
This value is more than 0.53 N/m2, the soil grains will not be stationary and sediment transport and scouring will occur.
