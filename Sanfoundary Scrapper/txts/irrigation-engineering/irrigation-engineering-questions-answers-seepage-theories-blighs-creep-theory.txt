1. What is the value of Bligh’s coefficient for coarse-grained soil?
a) 15
b) 12
c) 5 to 9
d) 8
b
S.No.
Type of soil
Value of C
1.
Micaceous sand
15
2.
Coarse-grained soil 
12
3.
Sand mixed with boulder and gravel and for loam soil
5 to 9
2. For sand mixed with boulder and gravel and for loam soil, the safe hydraulic gradient should be ___________
a) 1/15
b) 1/12
c) 1/5 to 1/9
d) 1/8
c
3. Which of the following is not a limitation of creep theory?
a) No distinction between the vertical and horizontal creep
b) No distinction between effectiveness of outer and inner faces of sheet pile
c) Significance of exit gradient is not considered
d) Only a nominal floor thickness is required on the upstream side so as to resist water
d
4. If the value of Bligh’s coefficient for a particular soil is equal to 12 then, what is the safe hydraulic gradient for that soil?
a) 1/12
b) 1/9
c) 1/15
d) 1/5
a
Bligh’s coefficient = 12
So, safe hydraulic gradient = 1/12.

5. According to Bligh, a vertical cut-off at U/s end of the floor is less useful than the one at the D/s end of the floor.
a) True
b) False
b
6. Consider the following statements about Bligh’s Creep Theory.
i. Creep length is the length of path traversed by percolating water
ii. To increase the path of percolation vertical cut-off or sheet piles can be provided
iii. Loss of head per unit creep length is hydraulic gradient
iv. Bligh gave no criteria for the safety of weir against undermining
Which of the following statements are correct?
a) i, ii, iii
b) ii, iii, iv
c) i, iii, iv
d) i, ii, iv
a
L = CH where, C = Bligh’s coefficient and H = seepage head
OR
Hydraulic gradient (i) ≤ 1/C.
7. As per Bligh’s theory, thickness to be provided by taking a factor of safety equal to _______
a) 2/3
b) 4/3
c) 1/3
d) 1/2
b
Thickness (t) = 4/3 x h / (G-1) where h = ordinate of HGL from top of floor and G = specific gravity of floor material.
8. Calculate the value of creep length for the following.
a) 50 m
b) 26 m
c) 58 m
d) 36 m
c
d1 = 6 m, d2 = 4 m, d3 = 8 m and b = 22 m
L = 22 + 2 x (6+4+8) = 58 m.
