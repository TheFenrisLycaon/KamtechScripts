a) inside the body of a gravity dam
b) inside the upstream reservoir
c) inside the downstream reservoir
d) on the side flanks of the main dam
b
2. The siphons installed within a gravity dam to spill the surplus reservoir water are known as ______________________
a) hooded type siphon spillway
b) tilted outlet type siphon spillway
c) both hooded and titled type siphon spillway
d) shaft spillway
b
3. The siphons installed over overflow dams constitute what are known as __________________
a) hooded type siphon spillway
b) tilted outlet type siphon spillway
c) discharge carriers
d) baby siphons
a
4. The only spillway among the following through which the discharge does not increase as fast as it increases in all others is _________________
a) chute spillway
b) side-channel spillway
c) ogee spillway
d) shaft spillway
d
5. The only spillway among the following through which the discharge is almost at its capacity rate even from the start of its functioning is ________________
a) chute spillway
b) side-channel spillway
c) ogee spillway
d) siphon spillway
d
6. An air vent is provided at FRL to break the siphoning action at that level in a ___________________
a) hooded type of siphon spillway
b) tilted outlet type of siphon spillway
c) saddle siphon spillway
d) volute siphon spillway
c
7. Which of the following spillway is designed in India by Ganesh Iyer?
a) Saddle siphon spillway
b) Saddle spillway
c) Glory hole spillway
d) Volute Siphon spillway
d
8. The crest of a siphon spillway is fixed at ________________
a) full reservoir level
b) dead storage level
c) maximum water level
d) top of the dam
a
9. A siphon spillway is sufficiently independent of the water surface elevation of the reservoir.
a) True
b) False
a
Q = Cd. A. (2gH)1/2 where Cd is the coefficient of discharge, A is the area of the cross-section and H is the effective head i.e. the difference of the water level in the reservoir and the tailwater level for a submerged outlet. The discharge through the spillway is affected to a very less extent is the water surface in the reservoir rises.
10. The allowable maximum negative head on an average is equal to __________
a) 2.5 m or so
b) 5 m or so
c) 7.5 m or so
d) 10 m or so
c
Limiting vaccum pressure = Atmospheric pressure – Vapour pressure = 10 – 2.5 = 7.5 m.
11. The structure which is not used in a shaft spillway is ________________
a) tunnel
b) bridge
c) radial gates
d) radial piers
c
12. Morning glory is the _____________________________
a) special flared inlet of the shaft spillway of a dam of very small height
b) special flared inlet of the shaft spillway of a large dam project
c) a horizontal tunnel constructed in a shaft spillway across the body of a gravity dam to carry surplus reservoir water to the d/s river
d) a horizontal tunnel constructed in a shaft spillway of an earthen dam through its foundation to carry surplus reservoir water to the d/s river
b
13. For a saddle siphon, the maximum operative head is 4.53 m. The width and height of the throat of the siphon are 5 m and 2.25 m respectively. The coefficient of discharge is 0.90. How many units are required to pass a flood of 350 cumecs? (Assume g = 10 m/s2)
a) One
b) Two
c) Three
d) Four
d
Q = Cd. A. (2gH)1/2 Where Cd = 0.9, H = 4.53 m and A = 5 x 2.25 = 11.25 m2
Q = 0.9 x 11.25 x (2 x 9.81 x 4.53)1/2 = 95.45 m3/sec
No. of units of saddle siphon = 350 / 95.45 = 3.66 units. = 4 units.
14. A siphon spillway in a concrete gravity dam is in the shape of ________________
a) U-shape
b) Inverted U-shape
c) Horizontal bend through the abutment
d) Any straight line
b
