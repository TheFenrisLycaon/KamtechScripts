1. Greater is the afflux, lesser will be the available clearance for the same deck level.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Greater is the reduction in the linear waterway, the lesser is the afflux.
a) True
b) False
b
3. The proposed masonry arch bridge having the total height of its abutments or piers from top to bottom as H can be proposed to have economical spans each equal to ______
a) 2/3 H
b) 2H
c) 1.2 H
d) 1.5 H
b
4. A bridge culvert is to be constructed across a proposed lined canal. The afflux at this site for a contracted canal width can be computed by __________
a) Unwin’s formula
b) Broad-crested weir formula
c) Orifice formula
d) Molesworth formula
d
h = [V2/17.88 + 0.01524] [(A/a)2 – 1]
Where, h = afflux in meters, V = velocity in an unobstructed stream in m/sec, A = unobstructed sectional area of the stream in sq.m and a = obstructed reduced c/s area of the stream at the bridge site.
5. While going to the Tirupati Tirumala Devasthanam from Madras, highway road is found to be lowered at several places over which natural drainage flow during the rainy season. Such dips in the roads are called ___________________
a) freeways
b) road dips
c) causeways
d) broadways
c
6. Which of the following formula is valid when the downstream depth is more than 80% of the upstream depth?
a) Unwin’s formula
b) Broad-crested weir formula
c) Orifice formula
d) Molesworth formula
c
Q = Co (2g) 1/2. L. ϒd. [h + (1+e)Va2 / 2g] where, Co = coefficient for the orifice formula, ϒd = downstream depth, Va2 / 2g = head due to velocity of approach.
7. What is the value of the coefficient of discharge for the wide bridge opening with floors?
a) 0.90
b) 0.94
c) 0.96
d) 0.98
c
TYPE OF BRIDGE OPENING
VALUE OF Cd
1. Narrow bridge with or without floors
0.94
2. Wide bridge opening with floors
0.98
3. Wide bridge opening with no bed floors
0.96
8. Calculate the economic length of one span for RCC Slab Bridge if the total height of abutment or pier from the bottom of its foundation to its top is 6m.
a) 6 m
b) 4 m
c) 9 m
d) 3 m
c
Clear span length = 1.5 x 6 = 9 m.
9. In Broad Crested Weir formula, the discharge is dependent on ________________
a) upstream water depth only
b) downstream water depth only
c) both upstream and downstream water depth
d) independent of both U/s and D/s water depth
a
10. Calculate the longitudinal braking force (P) for four-lane bridges designed for class 70R loading.
a) 14 tonnes
b) 21 tonnes
c) 17.5 tonnes
d) 35 tonnes
b
For four lane bridges- P = 0.3 x 70 = 21 tonnes. (20% + 5% of the loads in lanes in excess of two)
11. The greater is the heading up of water at the inlet end, the greater will be the flow velocity in case of culvert across some flat terrain.
a) True
b) False
a
12. The foundations of bridges on erodible beds are taken down below the HFL by an amount equal to _____________
a) 4/3 times the maximum scour depth
b) 2/3 times the maximum scour depth
c) 1.5 times the maximum scour depth
d) 2 times the maximum scour depth
a
