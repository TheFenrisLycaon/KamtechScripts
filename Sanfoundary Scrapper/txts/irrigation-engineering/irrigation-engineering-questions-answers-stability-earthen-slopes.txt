1. Which of the following method is also called as the Slices method?
a) Fellenius method
b) Swedish slip circle method
c) Bishop’s simplified method
d) Spencer’s method
b
2. In Fellenius method for small values of angle of internal friction of soil, the critical arc passes ________________
a) through the toe of the slope
b) above the toe of the slope
c) below the toe of the slope
d) anywhere near the toe of the slope
c
3. What is the correct expression of equivalent liquid unit weight?
a) ϒeq.tan2 [45 – Φ/2] 
b) ϒeq.tan2 [45 + Φ/2] 
c) ϒeq.tan [45 – Φ/2] 
d) ϒeq.tan [45 + Φ/2] 
a
ϒeq.tan2 [45 – Φ/2] 
where ϒeq = the equivalent unit weight of dry soil in foundation and dam and Φ = the equivalent angle of internal friction.
4. Calculate the maximum shear-stress induced if the horizontal average shear stress induced in u/s portion of the dam at the base is 36.45 kN/m2.
a) 43.74 kN/m2
b) 47.38 kN/m2
c) 51.03 kN/m2
d) 54.67 kN/m2
c
Ꞇmax = 1.4 Ꞇavg = 1.4 x 36.45 = 51.03 kN/m2.

5. Calculate the factor of safety at the point of maximum shear if unit shearing resistance is 97.9 kN/m2 and the maximum shear-stress induced is 55.72 kN/m2. Check whether the dam is safe or unsafe.
a) F.O.S = 1.93 and safe
b) F.O.S = 1.75 and unsafe
c) F.O.S = 0.569 and safe
d) F.O.S = 1.75 and safe
d
F.O.S = 97.9 / 55.72 = 1.75
this value should be more than unity, hence safe.
