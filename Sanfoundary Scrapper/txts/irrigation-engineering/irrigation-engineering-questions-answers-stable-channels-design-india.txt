12. Given to design the irrigation channel to carry 80 cumecs of discharge. The channel slope is 1 in 3000. The critical velocity ratio is 1.3. Take rugosity coefficient as 0.021.
a) Depth = 3 m, Base width = 15 m
b) Depth = 3.5 m, Base width = 15.5 m
c) Depth = 3.3 m, Base width = 15.2 m
d) Depth = 3.2 m, Base width = 15.1 m
d
Critical velocity (Vo) = 0.55my0.64 (y = depth of the channel)
= 0.55 x 1.3 x (2)0.64
= 1.114 m/sec
Area (A) = Q/Vo = 80 / 1.114 = 71.8 m2
Now assume side slope as (1/2): 1(1/2H: V)
Now, A = y (b + y x 1/2)
71.8 = 2(b + 2 x 1/2)
71.8 = 2(b + 1)
b = 34.9 m
Perimeter (P) = b + 2 x √5/2y
= 34.9 + 4.47
= 39.37 m
Now R = A/P = 71.8 / 39.37 = 1.82 m
V = ((1/n + (23 + 0.00155/s)) / (1 + (23 + 0.00155/s)n/\(\sqrt{RR}\)))\(\sqrt{RSRS}\) 
V = 0.78 m/sec
Now calculating for critical velocity,
Vo = 0.55 x 1.3 x y0.64
= 0.715 x y0.64
Now assume y = 2.5 m
Vo = 0.715 x (2.5)0.64 = 1.28 m/sec
A = 80 / 1.28 = 62.5 m2
62.5 = 2.5 (b + 1/2(2.5))
b = 23.75 m
P = 23.75 + 2 x √5/2(2.5) = 29.35 m
R = A/P = 2.13
√R  = 1.46
V = 75.27/1.4 x (1.46/54.8) = 1.432 m/sec
V > V0
Now assume y = 3.2 m
Vo = 0.715 x (3.2)0.64 = 1.51 m/sec
A = 80 / 1.5 = 53.33 m2
53.33 = 3.2 (b + 1.6)
b= 15.1 m
P = 15.1 + √5(3.2)
P = 22.2 m
R = A/P = 53.33/22.2 = 2.4 m
√R = 1.56
V = (75.27/1.4) x (1.56/54.8)
= 1.53 m/sec
Therefore V = Vo
Hence use the depth equal to 3.2 m and base width 15.1 m with slope 1/2:1.
13. Design a regime channel for a discharge of 90 cumecs and silt factor is 1.3 use Lacey’s Theory.
a) Depth = 2.2 m, Base width = 40.5 m, Slope = 1/4670
b) Depth = 2.12 m, Base width = 40.42 m, Slope = 1/4675
c) Depth = 2.135 m, Base width = 40.3 m, Slope = 1/4676
d) Depth = 2.123 m, Base width = 40.1 m, Slope = 1/4672
c
V = [Qf2/140]1/6 = 1.014 m/sec
A = Q/V = 90/1.014 = 88.76 m2
R = 5/2 x V2/f = 2 m
P = 4.75√Q = 45.06 m
For a trapezoidal channel with 1/2H: 1V slopes
P = b +√5y and A = (b + y/2) y
45.06 = b + √5y, 88.76 = (b + y/2) y
b = 45.06 – 2.24y, substitute this value in area equation
88.76 = (45.06 – 2.24y + y/2) y
Y = 2.135 m
b = 45.06 – 2.24 x 2.135 = 40.3 m
S = (f5/3 / 3340Q1/6) = 1/4676.
14. According to Lacey what factor is needed to have a true regime in an artificial channel?
a) Flow is Uniform
b) Critical Velocity = Actual Velocity
c) No Silting or Scouring Action
d) Lining of the Channel Bed
