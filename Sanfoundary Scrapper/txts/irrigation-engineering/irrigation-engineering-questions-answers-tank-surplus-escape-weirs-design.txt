1. The usual difference between F.T.L and M.T.L is rarely allowed to exceed _____________
a) 0.3 m
b) 0.6 m
c) 0.9 m
d) 0.5 m
c
2. Which of the following type of tank weirs are provided with a number of vertical steps instead of horizontal or sloping downstream apron?
a) Type A: Masonry weir with a vertical drop
b) Type B: Rock-fill weirs with a sloping apron
c) Type C: Masonry weirs with a glacis
d) Type D: Combination of Type A and Type C
d
3. The width of the horizontal floors of type A and D weirs from the foot of the drop wall to the d/s edge of the floor should never be less than ________________
a) 5 (D + H)
b) 3 (D + H)
c) 2.5 (D + H)
d) 2 (D + H)
d
4. Which among the following is a correct representation of Ryve’s formula?
a) Qp = C1. A2/3
b) Qp = C1. A1/3
c) Qp = C1. L A2/3
d) Qp = C1. A
a
Qp = C1.A2/3 where Qp is the peak flood discharge, C1 is the Ryve’s coefficient, A is the catchment area
The formula is directly applicable for free catchments in all isolated tanks.
5. The capacity of an irrigation tank is sometimes increased by installing a temporary stone wall over the top of the tank weir. This fixture is known as____________________
a) saddle
b) dam stone
c) breast wall
d) divide wall
b
6. The discharge through the sluice of a small irrigation tank is usually controlled by _______________
a) dam stone
b) plug
c) special balanced valves
d) shutters
b
7. What will the discharging capacity of a masonry waste weir of 55 m length and 1.5 m width provided in an earthen bund for passing a flood with 1.2 m water depth over its crest?
a) 120 cumecs
b) 254 cumecs
c) 59.4 cumecs
d) 65.8 cumecs
a
Q = C.L H3/2 where C = 1.66 when the width of rectangular crest > 0.9 m, L is the length of the weir and H is the head of water over the weir.
Q = 1.66 x 55 x 1.23/2 = 120 cumecs.
8. Pipe sluices are generally not adopted in tank bunds where the depth below F.T.L exceeds ____________
a) 1.5 m
b) 1 m
c) 2.5 m
d) 5 m
c
9. Calculate peak discharge for a combined catchment of a tank forming a constituent unit of a group with the following given data –
Combined catchment 			     = 26 sq. km
Intercepted catchment 			     = 20 sq. km
Ryve’s coefficient for combined catchment    = 9.0
Ryve’s coefficient intercepted 		     = 1.8
a) 66 cumecs
b) 59 cumecs
c) 50 cumecs
d) 69 cumecs
a
Peak flood discharge Qp = C1A2/3 – c1a2/3 where C1 = 9.0, c1 = 1.8, A = 26 sq.km and a = 20 sq.km
Qp = (9 x 262/3) – (1.8 x 202/3) = 65.9 cumecs.
10. What is the approximate value of Ryve’s coefficient for combined catchment having limited areas near hills?
a) 6.5
b) 8.5
c) 10.2
d) Up to 40
c
