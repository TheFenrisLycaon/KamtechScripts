12. Furrows of 150 m long and 2 m apart, have longitudinal slope of 0.5 percent are initially irrigated by non-erosive stream for 100 minutes. The stream size is reduced to 50% and continued for another 40 minutes. Determine the average depth of irrigation.
a) 50.34 mm
b) 43.56 mm
c) 47.58 mm
d) 43.84 mm
d
Now we have qm = 0.6/s = 0.6/0.5 = 1.2 lps
Now q = 0.4qm = 0.4×1.2 = 0.48 lps
Average depth of water applied
= (2 x 100 x 60 + 0.48 x 40 x 60) / 1000 x (1 / 300) x 1000
= (12+1.152) / 300 x 1000
= 43.84 mm.

b) Free Flooding
c) Contour Farming
d) Basin Flooding
a
15. In which method of flooding, does the water take circuitous route to irrigate the land?
a) Check Flooding
b) Zigzag Flooding
c) Free Flooding
d) Basin Flooding
b
