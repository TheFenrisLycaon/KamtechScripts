1. For maximum productivity of crops both surface and sub-surface drains are sometimes needed.
a) True
b) False
a
2. How can tile drainage help to increase crop yields?
a) Increases Free Gravity Water
b) Increases Volume of Soil
c) Decrease Air Circulation
d) Increases Water Table Level
b
3. Tile drainage helps to reduce soil erosion.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Which type of soils is benefited by using tile drainage?
a) Dry Soils
b) Black Soils
c) Wet Soils
d) Red Soils
c
5. In what chemical ways does tile drainage help in plant growth?
a) Decreases Alkalinity of Soils
b) Increases salinity of Soils
c) Increases Nitrogen
d) Reduces and Removes Toxic Substances
d
6. Under what strata the tile drainage should not be placed?
a) In Shallow Depths
b) More Pervious Strata
c) Less Pervious Strata
d) Pervious Strata
c
7. What structure is surrounded around the tile drains when used in less pervious strata?
a) Envelope Filters
b) French Drains
c) Beehive Grate
d) Surface Inlet
a
8. What is the size of the tile at an outlet of a 12 hectare drainage system, if the D.C is 2 cm and the tile grade is 0.5%. Assume the rugosity coefficient as 0.015 for the tile drain material.
a) 10 cm
b) 20 cm
c) 15 cm
d) 25 cm
b
Volume of water passing the drain in one second = (1200/24 x 3600) = 1/72 m3/sec
Q = 1/72 m3/sec
Q = 1/n x A x R2/3 x S1/2
A = πD2/4, P = πD, R = A/P = D/4
1/72 = (1/0.015) x (πD2/4) x (D/4) x (0.5/100)
On solving the value of D = 17.4 cm
Use D = 20 cm.
9. Which type of alternate layouts system for tile drainage has two mains?
a) Grid Iron System
b) Natural System
c) Double main System
d) Herring Bone System
c
10. How many cubic metres of water will be removed for this particular period of a system designed to use a D.C of 1.5 cm draining 20 hectares for a capacity of 5 days?
a) 10000 m3
b) 25000 m3
c) 15000 m3
d) 20000 m3
c
Volume of water entering the drain per day = (1.5/100) x 20 x 104 = 3000 m3/day
Volume of water passing the drain within 5 days of flow = 5 x 3000 = 15000 m3.
