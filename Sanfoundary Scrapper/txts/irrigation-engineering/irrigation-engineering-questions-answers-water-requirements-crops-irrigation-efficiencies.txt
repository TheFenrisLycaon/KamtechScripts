1. Which efficiency is also called on-farm efficiency?
a) Water conveyance efficiency
b) Water application efficiency
c) Water storage efficiency
d) Water use efficiency
b
2. What is water conveyance efficiency?
a) The ratio of the quantity of water delivered to the field and quantity of water pumped into the canal
b) The ratio of water stored in the root zone and the water delivered to the field
c) The ratio of water used beneficially and the water delivered to the field
d) The ratio of water stored in the root zone and the water needed before irrigation
a
3. The quantity of water beneficially used is the sum of the water used by the crops and the water used for leaching.
a) True
b) False
a
4. The mean depth of water is 1.5 cm and the mean deviation from the mean is 0.1 cm. Determine its distribution efficiency.
a) 15%
b) 85%
c) 66.66%
d) 93%
d
Nd = (1- d/D) x 100; where d = mean deviation and D = mean depth of water
Given, d=0.1 cm and D = 1.5 cm
Hence, Nd = 93%.
5. The presence of excess salts in the soil requires _____________
a) high water storage efficiency
b) low water storage efficiency
c) high water application efficiency
d) high water use efficiency
a
6. Which of the following statement is wrong about consumptive use efficiency?
a) It is the ratio of normal consumptive use of water to the net amount of water depleted from the root zone
b) It accounts for the loss of water by deep percolation
c) Evaporation losses are considered
d) The losses due to percolation and evaporation are not considered
d
7. The quantity of water that is pumped into a farm distribution system is 2 cumec. 1.6 cumec is delivered to a turn-out, 1km from the well. Compute the conveyance efficiency.
a) 80%
b) 20%
c) 50%
d) 60%
a
Given, Output = 1.6 cumec and Input = 2 cumec
So, Nc = 80%.
8. If the water losses are more, the output and the efficiency is more.
a) True
b) False
b
9. Determine the distribution efficiency, if the depths of water in the field are 1.1 cm and 1.8 cm.
a) 80%
b) 90%
c) 85%
d) 75%
d
Deviation from mean depth (d) = 1.80 – 1.45 = 1.1 – 1.45 = 0.35 (neglecting negative sign)
Nd = (1 – d/D) x 100 = 75%.
10. Uniformity coefficient is also known as ____________
a) water conveyance efficiency
b) consumptive use efficiency
c) water distribution efficiency
d) water storage efficiency
c
11. The water distribution efficiency is 1.0 if _____________
a) the deviation from the mean depth is 1
b) the deviation from the mean depth is 0
c) the deviation from the mean depth is less than 1
d) the deviation from the mean depth is greater than 1
b
12. What is the correct formula for uniformity coefficient efficiency?
a) Nd = 1 – d/D
b) Nd = 1 + d/D
c) Nd = 1 – D/d
d) Nd = 1 + D/d
a
Where Nd = water distribution efficiency, d = deviation from the mean depth and D = mean depth.
