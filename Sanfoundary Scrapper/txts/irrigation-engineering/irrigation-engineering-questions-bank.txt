a) 5 m or more
b) Less than 5 m
c) 0.5 m or more
d) Less than 0.5 m
a
3. The area-elevation curve when integrated will yield the capacity-elevation curve.
a) True
b) False
a

a) Prismoidal formula
b) Trapezoidal method
c) Average formula
d) Integration method
d
5. The surcharge storage in a dam reservoir is the volume of water stored ________________
a) between the minimum and maximum reservoir levels
b) between the minimum and normal reservoir levels
c) between normal and maximum reservoir levels
d) below the minimum pool level
c
6. The useful storage in a dam reservoir is the volume of water stored __________________
a) between the minimum and maximum reservoir levels
b) between the minimum and normal reservoir levels
c) between normal and maximum reservoir levels
d) below the minimum pool level
b
7. The dead storage in a dam reservoir is the available volume for collection of silt and sediment between _______________
a) bed level of the reservoir and minimum reservoir level
b) bed level of the reservoir and the silt level in the reservoir
c) bed level of the reservoir and the normal pool level
d) above the minimum pool level
a
8. Bank storage in a dam reservoir _________________
a) increases the compound reservoir capacity
b) decreases the computed reservoir capacity
c) sometimes increases and sometimes decreases the computed reservoir capacity
d) has no effect on computed reservoir capacity
a
9. The valley storage reduces the effective storage capacity of a reservoir.
a) True
b) False
a
10. The maximum level to which the water rises during the worst design flood is known as _________________________
a) full Reservoir level
b) maximum conservation level
c) minimum pool level
d) surcharge storage
a
11. Which of the following formula can be used to determine the storage when three consecutive sections at equal height are taken?
a) Prismoidal formula
b) Trapezoidal method
c) Average formula
d) Integration method
a
Storage = h/6 [A1 + 4A2 + A3] where A1, A2, and A3 are the areas of succeeding contours and h is the vertical distance between two alternate contours.
It can be preferably used where three consecutive sections at equal height are taken.
