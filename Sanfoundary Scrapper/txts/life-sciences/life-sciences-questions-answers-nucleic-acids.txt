a) 30%
b) 40%
c) 60%
d) 20%
a
                                                            (A+G) + (T+C) =100%
                                                         (A+20) + (T+20) =100%
                                                         (A+20) + (A+20) = 100%
                                                                                  2A= 100-40%
                                                                                   A = 30%.
