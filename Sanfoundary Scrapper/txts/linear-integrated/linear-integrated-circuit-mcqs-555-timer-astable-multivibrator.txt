1. Free running frequency of Astable multivibrator?
a) f=1.45/(RA+2RB)C
b) f=1.45(RA+2RB)C
c) f=1.45C/(RA+2RB)
d) f=1.45 RA/( RA+RB)
a
Therefore, f = 1/T =1.45/(RA+2RB)C.
2. Find the charging and discharging time of 0.5µF capacitor.
a) Charging time=2ms; Discharging time=5ms
b) Charging time=5ms; Discharging time=2ms
c) Charging time=3ms; Discharging time=5ms
d) Charging time=5ms; Discharging time=3ms
b
The time required to discharge the capacitor is tLow=0.69xRC =0.69x5kΩx0.5µF=2ms.
3. Astable multivibrator operating at 150Hz has a discharge time of 2.5m. Find the duty cycle of the circuit.
a) 50%
b) 75%
c) 95.99%
d) 37.5%
d
∴ Duty cycle, D%=(tLow/T) x 100% = (2.5ms/6.67ms)x100% = 37.5%.
4. Determine the frequency and duty cycle of a rectangular wave generator.
a) Frequency=63.7kHz; Duty cycle=50%
b) Frequency=53.7kHz; Duty cycle=55%
c) Frequency=43.7kHz; Duty cycle=50%
d) Frequency=60kHz; Duty cycle=55%
b
Where RA=100Ω+50Ω=150Ω,
RB=100Ω+20Ω=120Ω.
=>∴f=1.45/((150+120)x0.1µF) = 53703Hz = 53.7kHz.
Duty cycle, D% = [RB/(RA+RB)] x 100% = 120Ω/(150Ω +120Ω) x 100% = 0.55×100% = 55%. 
5. How to achieve 50% duty cycle in adjustable rectangular wave generator?                                      (Assume R1 –> Resistor connected between supply and discharge and R2 –> Resistor connected between discharge and trigger input.)
a) R1 < R2
b) R1 > R2
c) R1 = R2
d) R1 ≥ R2
c
6. How to obtain symmetrical waveform in Astable multivibrator?
a) Use clocked RS flip-flop
b) Use clocked JK flip-flop
c) Use clocked D-flip-flop
d) Use clocked T-flip-flop
b
7. Determine the output frequency of the circuit.
a) 1450Hz
b) 1333Hz
c) 1871Hz
d) 1700Hz
c
f=1.45/[(RA||RC)+2(RB)]xC = 1.45/[(2.3kΩ||2.3kΩ) + (2×3.3kΩ)] x 0.1µF = 1.45/{[(2.3×2.3)/(2.3+2.3)] + 6.6kΩ}x0.1µF = 1.45/(7.75×10-4) = 1870.9 ≅ 1871Hz. 
8. How does a monostable multivibrator used as frequency divider?
a) Using square wave generator
b) Using triangular wave generator
c) Using sawtooth wave generator
d) Using sine wave generator
a
