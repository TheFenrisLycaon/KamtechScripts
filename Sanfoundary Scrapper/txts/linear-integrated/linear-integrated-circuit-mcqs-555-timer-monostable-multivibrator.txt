1. Determine the time period of a monostable 555 multivibrator.
a) T = 0.33RC
b) T = 1.1RC
c) T = 3RC
d) T = RC
b
2. Find monostable vibrator circuit using 555 timer.
a
3. How to overcome mistriggering on the positive pulse edges in the monostable circuit?
a) Connect a RC network at the input
b) Connect an integrator at the input
c) Connect a differentiator at the input
d) Connect a diode at the input
c
The circuit shows the differentiator to be connected between trigger input and the +VCC. 
4. A monostable multivibrator has R = 120kΩ and the time delay T = 1000ms, calculate the value of C?
a) 0.9µF
b) 1.32µF
c) 7.5µF
d) 2.49µF
c
=> C = T/(1.1R) = 1000ms/(1.1×120kΩ) = 7.57µF.

5. Which among the following can be used to detect the missing heart beat?
a) Monostable multivibrator
b) Astable multivibrator
c) Schmitt trigger
d) None of the mentioned
a
6. A 555 timer in monostable application mode can be used for
a) Pulse position modulation
b) Frequency shift keying
c) Speed control and measurement
d) Digital phase detector
c
7. How can a monostable multivibrator be modified into a linear ramp generator?
a) Connect a constant current source to trigger input
b) Connect a constant current source to trigger output
c) Replace resistor by constant current source
d) Replace capacitor by constant current source
c
8. Determine time period of linear ramp generator using the specifications
RE = 2.7kΩ, R1 =47kΩ , R2 100kΩ , C= 0.1µF, VCC =5v.
a) 8ms
b) 4ms
c) 2ms
d) 1ms
d
= {(2/3)×5v×[2.7kΩ×(4.7kΩ+ 100kΩ)]×(0.1µF)}/{[(47kΩ)×5v]-[(0.7)×(47kΩ+100kΩ)]}
=>T= 132.3/132.100 =1.0015×10-3 = 1ms. 
9. What will be the output, if a modulating input signal and continuous triggering signal are applied to pin5 and pin22 respectively in the following circuit?
a) Frequency modulated wave form
b) Pulse width modulated wave form
c) Both pulse and frequency modulated wave form
d) None of the mentioned
b
