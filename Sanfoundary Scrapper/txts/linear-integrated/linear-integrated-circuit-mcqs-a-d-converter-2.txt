c) Monitoring system
d) All of the mentioned
d
4. In integrating type ADCs, the
a) Input voltage is proportional to input averaged over the integration period
b) Output voltage is proportional to input averaged over the integration period
c) Output voltage is proportional to sum of input voltage
d) Input voltage is proportional to sum of input voltage
b
5. Which type of ADC is chosen for noisy environment?
a) Successive approximation ADC
b) Dual slope
c) Charge balancing ADC
d) All of the mentioned
c
6. How to overcome the drawback of the charge balancing ADC?
a) By using precision integrator
b) By using Voltage to frequency converter
c) By using voltage comparator
d) By using dual slope converter
d
7. Which among the following has long conversion time?
a) Servo converter
b) Dual ramp converter
c) Flash converter
d) None of the mentioned
b
8. In which application dual slop converter are used.
a) Thermocouple
b) Digital panel meter
c) Weighting scale
d) All of the mentioned
b
9. A dual slope has the following specifications:
16bit counter; Clock rate =4 MHz; Input voltage=12v; Output voltage =-7v and Capacitor=0.47µF.
If the counters have cycled through 2n counts, determine the value of resistor in the integrator.
a) 60kΩ
b) 50kΩ
c) 120kΩ
d) 100kΩ
a
△(t) =t2-t1 =2ncounts/clock rate =216/4Mhz=16.38ms.
For integration,
△Vo=(-1/RC)×V×( t2-t1)
=> RC = -(12v/-7v) ×16.38ms=28.08ms
∴ R= 28.08ms =59744 ≅60kΩ. 
10. A 12 bit dual ramp generation has a maximum output voltage of +12v. Compute the equivalent digital number for the analog signal of +6v.
a) 1000000000
b) 10000000000
c) 1000000000000
d) 100000000000
d
N= 212×(6/12v) = 4096×0.5 =2048.
Binary equivalent for 2048 => 100000000000.
