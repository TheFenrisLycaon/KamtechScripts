1. How an AC amplifier can be powered by a single supply voltage, produces voltage swing?
a) By inserting a voltage divider at the inverting input
b) By inserting a voltage divider at the non-inverting input
c) By inserting a voltage divider at the output
d) By inserting a voltage divider at the feedback circuit
b
2. Given below are the circuits connected to the non-inverting input terminal of AC amplifier. Choose the circuit which produces positive output swing equal the negative?
b
3.  What is the output waveform at the point VO1 in the given circuit? (Take R1=1kΩ and RF=5kΩ)
c
Vo = -(RF/R1)×Vin = -(5kΩ/1kΩ)×6Vp = 30Vp sinewave. 
4. The input waveform of an AC non-inverting amplifier with single supply is given below. Find the output waveform?
b
5. Find the maximum output voltage swing of an AC inverting amplifier using op-amp 741C?
a) +15Vpp
b) ±15Vpp
c) ±13Vpp
d) +13Vpp
a
6. Determine the lower cut-off frequency of the circuit.
a) 21.3Hz
b) 12.15Hz
c) 1.35Hz
d) None of the mentioned
d
As [ri×(1+AB)] >> R2
=> Therefore, equ 1 becomes
RIF ≅ R2 || R3 = 100kΩ || 100kΩ = (100×100)/(100+100) = 50kΩ.
=> Rin = Ro = 150Ω.
∴ Lower cut off frequency, fL= 1/[2πCi×(RIF+Ro)] = 1/[2π×0.47µF×(50kΩ+150Ω)] = 6.75Hz. 
7. In differential op-amp configuration a subtractor is called as
a) Summing amplifier
b) Difference amplifier
c) Scaling amplifier
d) All of the mentioned
c
