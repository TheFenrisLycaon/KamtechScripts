6. Find out the application in which narrow band-reject filter can be used?
a) Embedded system
b) Biomedical instrument
c) Digital computer
d) None of the mentioned
b
7. Design 120Hzactive notch filter?
a
Notch Frequency, fn = 1/2πRC.
R= 1/(2πfnC)= 1/(2π×120Hz×0.68×10-6) = 1.95kΩ  ≅2kΩ.
For R/2, parallel of two 2kΩ resistor
=>R/2 = 2kΩ||2kΩ =(2×2)/(2+2)=1kΩ.
For C/2 , parallel of two 0.68µF capacitor
C/2=> 0.68µF + 0.68µF= 1.36µF. 
8. Find the application of area where all-pass filters are used?
a) Cathode ray oscilloscope
b) Television
c) Telephone wire
d) None of the mentioned
c
9. Determine the output voltage for all the all-pass filter and express it in complex form?
a) VO =Vin/ [(1-j2πfRC) /(1+ j2πfRC)].
b) VO =Vin× [(1+j2πfRC) /(1- j2πfRC)].
c) VO =Vin ×[(1- j2πfRC) /(1+ j2πfRC)].
d) None of the mentioned
c
10. Determine the input frequency for all-pass filter with phase angle as 62o. Consider the value of resistor and capacitor are 3.3kΩ and 4.7µF.
a) Input frequency= -7.65Hz
b) Input frequency= -6.77Hz
c) Input frequency= -3.89Hz
d) Input frequency= -9.65Hz
d
=> f=-tanΦ/4πRC =-tan(62o)/(4π×3.3kΩ×4.7µF)= -1.88/0.1948 =-9.65Hz. 
11. Determine the angle for given circuit diagram, if the frequency of input signal is 1khz
