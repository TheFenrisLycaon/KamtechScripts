a) 360o phase shift
b) 180o phase shift
c) 90o phase shift
d) 60o phase shift
b
2. How many RC stages are used in the RC phase shift oscillator?
a) Six
b) Two
c) Four
d) Three
d
3. Calculate the frequency of oscillation for RC phase shift oscillator having the value of R and C as 35Ω and 3.7µF respectively.
a) 1230 Hz
b) 204 Hz
c) 502Hz
d) 673 Hz
c
fo=1/(2πRC√6) = 1/(2×3.14×√6×3.7µF×35Ω)
=>  fo=  1/ 1.9921×10-3 = 502Hz.

a) Gain of amplifier is kept greater than 29

a
5. Calculate the feedback voltage from phase shit network.
a) Vf = ( VoR3S3C3) / (1+ 6SRC+5S2C2R2+S3R3C3)
b) Vf = ( VoR3S3C3) / (1+ 5SRC+6S2C2R2+S3R3C3)
c) Vf = ( VoR3S3C3) / (1+ 5SRC+5S2C2R2+S3R3C3)
d) Vf = ( VoR2S3C3) / (1+ 6SRC+5S2C2R2+S3R3C3)
b
=> I1(R+(1/SC))-I2=Vo  -> Equ1
=> -I1R+ I2(2R+(1/SC))- I3R=0 -> Equ2
=> 0- I2R+ I3(2R+(1/SC)=6 -> Equ3
WKT, Vf = I3× 2R,
Solving Equ 1, 2, and 3 for I3
=> I3= ( VoR2S3C3)/ (1+ 5SRC+6S2C2R2+S3R3C3)
=> Vf = I3× 2R
=( VoR3S3C3) / (1+ 5SRC+6S2C2R2+S3R3C3).
6. Which type of op-amp is avoided for high frequencies?
a) LM318
b) Op-amp 741
c) LF 351
d) None of the mentioned
b
7. Find out the constant values of α and ß in phase shift oscillator.
a) α = √6, ß = -1/29
b) α = 6, ß = -1/29
c) α = √6, ß = 1/29
d) α = 6, ß = -1/29
a
ß= 1/(1-5 α2)+j α(6- α2)  -> Equ1
For  Aß=1, ß should be real and the imaginary terms must be zero
α(6- α2)  =0
=> α=√6
Now substituting α2=6 in Equ 1, we get
ß=-1/29 (Negative sign indicates that the feedback network produces a phase shift of 180o).
8. A phase shift oscillator is designed to oscillate at 155Hz. Determine the value of Rf. (Take C=0.30µF)
a) 399Ω
b) 3.98MΩ
c) 13.9kΩ
d) 403kΩ
d
=> R= 1/7.153×10-4= 1398=13.9kΩ. 
9. The value of feedback resistor in phase shift oscillator is 180kΩ. Find its input resistance?
a) 52kΩ
b) 151kΩ
c) 209kΩ
d) 6.2kΩ
c
=> |A|=29 or |Rf / R1|=29
=> R1|= Rf / 29 = 180kΩ/29= 6.21kΩ, 
10. Determine the frequency of oscillation (fo) in phase shift oscillator?
a) fo = √6/ωRC
b) fo = 0.56/ωRC
c) fo = 0.065/ωRC
d) fo = 6/ωRC
c
fo = 1/(2π×RC×√6) = 1/15.38×RC
=> fo = 0.065/RC. 
11. The condition for zero phase shift in wein bridge oscillator is achieved by
a) Connecting feedback to non-inverting input terminal of op-amp
b) Balancing the bridge
c) Applying parallel combination of RC to the feedback network
d) All of the mentioned
b
