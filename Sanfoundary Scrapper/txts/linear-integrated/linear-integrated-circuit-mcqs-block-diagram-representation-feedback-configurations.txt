1. A feedback amplifier is also called as
a) Open loop amplifier
b) Closed loop amplifier
c) Feedback network amplifier
d) Looped network amplifier
b
2. How many types of configuration are available for feedback amplifier?
a) Six
b) Four
c) Two
d) Eight
b
3. Which of the following is not a feedback configuration?
a) Current-series feedback
b) Voltage-shunt feedback
c) Current-Voltage feedback
c) Current-Shunt feedback
c
4. When load current flows into the feedback circuit, the configuration is said to be
a) Current-shunt feedback
b) Voltage-shunt feedback
c) Voltage-series feedback
d) All of the mentioned
b
5. Find the voltage-series feedback amplifier from the given diagram?
a
6. On what criteria does the feedback amplifier are classified?
a) Signal fed back to input
b) Signal applied to input
c) Signal fed back to output
d) None of the mentioned
d
7. The closed loop voltage gain is reciprocal of
a) Voltage gain of op-amp
b) Gain of the feedback circuit
c) Open loop voltage gain
d) None of the mentioned
b
=> AF = 1+( RF/ R1) ; B= R1/( R1+ RF)
=> B = 1+( R1/ RF)
Therefore, AF = 1/B.
8. Select the specifications that implies the inverting amplifier?
a) V1 = -3v, V2 = -4v
b) V1 = -2v, V2 = 3v
c) V1 = 5v, V 2 = 15v
d) V1 = 0v, V2 = 5v
d
