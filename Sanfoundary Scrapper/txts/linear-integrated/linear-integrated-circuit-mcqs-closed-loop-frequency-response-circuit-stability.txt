b) Theoretical method
c) Analytical method
d) All of the mentioned
d
7. A standard block diagram of closed loop system composes of
a) Two blocks
b) Single block
c) Three blocks
d) None of the mentioned
a
(i) Forward block and
 (ii) Feedback block. 
8. “Transfer function” in control system refers to
a) Feedback block
b) Content of each block
c) Forward block
d) Input and output blocks
b
9. Which method is considered to be a graphical method in testing the system?
a) Bode plot
b) Routh-Hurwitz criteria
c) Circuit testing
d) None of the mentioned
a
10. Measure taken to increase the bandwidth of an op-amp.
a) Increase the frequency for the configuration
b) Reduce the gain of the configuration
c) Closed loop configuration is used
d) Open loop configuration is used
c
11. Name the block connected in the feedback path
a) Feedback block
b) Forward block
c) Output block
d) Summation of feedback, forward and output block
a
12. When the magnitude of (AoL )×( ß ) = 0dB, state the condition at which system become stable?
a) Phase angle is > -180o
b) Phase angle is < -180o
c) Phase angle is > +180o
d) Phase angle is < +180o
a
At lower frequency the contribution of AoL is zero. So, AoL×ß >0 and obviously AF < AoL and system is stable. 
13. Mention the phase condition that leads to sustained oscillation
a) ∠-Aß =0
b) All of the mentioned
c) ∠-Aß = multiple of 2π
d) ∠Aß = odd multiple of π
b
=> Loop gain, AoL×ß =1
Since AoL*ß  is a complex quantity , the magnitude is |AoL×ß |=1 and the phase condition are ∠-Aß=0 (or multiple of 2π) or ∠Aß= π (or odd multiple of π). 
14. Determine the state of the system
a) Stable system
b) Unstable system
c) Casual system
d) Bounded system
b
15. Find out the system stability when a system has three RC poles pairs
a) Attain stability at low frequency
b) Attain stability at high frequency
c) Attain instability at high frequency
d) Attain instability at low frequency
c
