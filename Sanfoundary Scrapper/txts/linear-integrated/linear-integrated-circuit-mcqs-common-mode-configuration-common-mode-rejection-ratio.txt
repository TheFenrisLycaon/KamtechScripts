1. When does the op-amp said to operate in common-mode configuration?
a) When the input voltage are equal
b) When input voltage is equal to the output voltage
c) When same voltage is applied to both input terminal of an op-amp
d) When different voltage is applied to both input and terminal of an op-amp
c
2. Common mode voltage gain of an op-amp is generally
a) >1
b) =1
c) <1
d) None of the mentioned
c
3. Find the op-amp common mode configuration
b
4. Calculate the common-mode voltage gain for the circuit
a) 30*10-3
b) 17*10-3
c) 51*10-3
d) 2.4*10-3
d
5. Define the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of op-amp?
a) CMRR=AD/ACM
b) CMRR=ACM/ AD
c) CMRR=VOCM/ACM
d) CMRR=AD*ACM
a
6. Determine the common mode output voltage .Given CMRR=65db
a) 2.81mV
b) 281.17mV
c) 28.11mV
d) 0.281mV
b
WKT, CMRR =( AD* VCM)/ VOCM= 20logCMRR = 65db = 10(65/20) = 1778.28
=> Common mode output voltage, VOCM= ( AD* VCM)/CMRR  = (10*5mV)/1778.28= 281.17mV.
7. Find the correct equation for common-mode rejection ratio
a) CMRR = 20log(AD/ ACM)
b) CMRR = 20log(Vio/ VCM)
c) CMRR = (AD* VCM)/ VOCM
d) All of the mentioned
d
8. When an op-amp exhibits poor common mode rejection?
a) Small common mode output voltage
b) Large common mode output voltage
c) Negligible common mode output voltage
d) None of the mentioned
b
9.  Higher value of common mode rejection ratio can be reached
a) By reducing the common mode voltage
b) By decreasing the differential gain
c) By reducing the common mode input voltage
d) All of the mentioned
d
