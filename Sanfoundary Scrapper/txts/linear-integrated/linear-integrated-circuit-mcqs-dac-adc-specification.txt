1. Find out the resolution of 8 bit DAC/ADC?
a)  562
b)  625
c)  256
d)  265
c
Resolution =2n, where n-> number of bits
∴ Resolution =28=256 possible output values. 
2. Non-linearity in the output of converter is expressed in
a) None of the mentioned
b) Percentage of reference voltage
c) Percentage of resolution
d) Percentage of full scale voltage
d
3. A binary input 000 is fed to a 3bit DAC/ADC. The resultant output is 101. Find the type of error?
a) Settling error
b) Gain error
c) Offset error
d) Linearity error
c
4.  How many equal intervals are present in a 14-bit D-A converter?
a) 16383
b) 4095
c) 65535
d) 1023
a
5. Resolution of a 6 bit DAC can be stated as
a) Resolution of 1 part in 63
b) 6-bit resolution
c) Resolution of 1.568% of full scale
d) All of the mentioned
d
=> Thus, resolution of a 6 bit DAC can be stated as a resolution of 1 part in 63. 
6. Find the resolution of a 10-bit AD converter for an input range of 10v?

c) Greater than or equal to (1/2)LSB
d) None of the mentioned
d
8. The maximum deviation between actual and ideal converter output after the removal of error is
a) Absolute accuracy
b) Relative accuracy
c) Relative /absolute accuracy
d) Linearity
b
