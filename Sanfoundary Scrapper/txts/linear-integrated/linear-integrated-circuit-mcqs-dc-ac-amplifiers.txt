5. Find the AC inverting amplifier from the circuits given below?
a
6. Determine the bandwidth of the AC inverting amplifier for high cut-off frequency of 15 Hz?
a) 4.321Hz
b) 8.356Hz
c) 7.056Hz
d) 2.334Hz
b
=> The source resistance RIN=RO=5kΩ.
Therefore, Low frequency cut-off, fL=1/2πCi(RIF+RO) = 1/ [2π×4.7µF×(5kΩ+100Ω)] = 6.64Hz. and the bandwidth is calculated as, BW= fH-fL = 15Hz-6.64Hz = 8.356Hz. 
7. When does the offset voltage compensating network must be used in inverting configuration?
a) When the input is AC voltage
b) When the input is DC voltage
c) When the input is either AC or DC voltage
d) None of the mentioned
b
8. State the application in which summing, scaling or averaging amplifiers are used?
a) Multiplexers
b) Counters
c) Audio mixers
d) All of the mentioned
