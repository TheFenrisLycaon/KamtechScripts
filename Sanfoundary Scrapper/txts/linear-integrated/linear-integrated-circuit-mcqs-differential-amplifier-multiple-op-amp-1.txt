a) Differential amplifier with one op-amp
b) Differential amplifier with two op-amps
c) Differential amplifier with three op-amps
d) Differential amplifier with four op-amps
a
3. What will be the output voltage when Vx =0v?
(Where Vx –> inverting input terminal of differential amplifier with one op-amp)
a) Vo = -(1+R F/R1)*V1
b) Vo   = -(1- R F/ R1)*V1
c) Vo  = (1+ R F/ R1)*V1
d) Vo = (R F/ R1)*V1
c
4. Compute the output voltage from the following circuit diagram?
a) -17v
b) -27v
c) -39v
d) -15v
b
Vo  = -(RF/R1)*VA  = -(15kΩ/1.5kΩ)*2.7v = -10*2.7 = -27v.
5. Compute the output voltage if the input voltage is reduced to zero in differential amplifier with one op-amp?
a) Inverted Voltage
b) Same as the input voltage
c) Amplified inverted voltage
d) Cannot be determined
d
6. The difference between the input and output voltage are -1v and 17v. Calculate the closed loop voltage gain of differential amplifier with one op-amp?
a) -51
b) 34
c) -17
d) 14
c
=> AD = 17v/-1v = -17v.
7. For the differential amplifier given below, determine the Vx and RF value. Assume that the circuit is initially nulled.
a) Vx = -8v, RF  = 9.9kΩ
b) Vx = 8v, RF = 9.9kΩ
c) Vx = -8v, RF  = -9.9kΩ
d) Vx = 8v, RF = -9.9kΩ
d
=> RF = -3*3.3kΩ = -9.9kΩ
The net output is given is VO=-(RF /R1)*(Vx-Vy)
=> Vx= Vy– Vo (-R1 /RF)
=> Vx = 6+6(3.3kΩ/9.9kΩ) = 6+2 = 8v.
8. The gain of differential amplifier with one op-amp is same as that of
a) The inverting amplifier
b) The non-inverting amplifier
c) Both inverting and non-inverting amplifier
d) None of the mentioned
a
9. Find the value of input resistance for differential amplifier with one op-amp. If R1 = R2=100Ω and RF  = R3  =5kΩ.
a) RIFx = 110Ω; RIFy = 6.7kΩ
b) RIFx = 100Ω; RIFy = 5.1kΩ
c) RIFx = 150Ω; RIFy = 7.2kΩ
d) RIFx = 190Ω; RIFy = 9.0kΩ
b
=> ∴ RIFx = 100Ω and
=> RIFy =100+5kΩ =5.1kΩ.
10. What is the net output voltage for differential amplifier with one op-amp
a) Vo = -(RF /R1)*Vx
b) Vo = -(RF /R1)*(Vx -Vy)
c) Vo = (1+RF /R1)*(Vx -Vy)
d) None of the mentioned
b
