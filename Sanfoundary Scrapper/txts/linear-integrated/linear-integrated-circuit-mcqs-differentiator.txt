10. A sine wave of 1vpeak at 1000Hz is applied to a differentiator with the following specification: RF =1kΩ and C1=0.33µF, find the output waveform?
a
The output of differentiator Vo = -RF×C1×(dVin/dt) =(1kΩ)×(0.33µF)×d[sin2π×1000t]/dt
= -3.3×10-4×2π×1000 ×[cos2π(1000)t] =-2.07×[cos2π(1000)t]. 
11. Choose the value of RF and C for a 5kHz input signal to obtain good differentiation.
a) RF = 1.6×103Ω,  C1 = 33×10-6F
b) RF = 1.6×103Ω,  C1 = 0.47×10-6F
c) RF = 1.6×103Ω,  C1 = 47×10-6F
d) RF = 1.6×103 Ω, C1 = 10×10-6F
b
Given f=5kHz , T=1/f = 1/5kHz = 2×10-4 –> Equ(1)
RF×C1 = 0.4µF×1.6kΩ =7.52×10-4 –> Equ(2)
Hence Equ(1) ≥ Equ(2). 
12. Determine the transfer function for the practical differentiator
a) Vo(s) /V1(s) = -S×RF×C1/(1+R1×C1)2
b) Vo(s) /V1(s) = -S×RF×C1/(1+RF×C1)2
c) Vo(s) /V1(s) = -S×RF×C1/(1+R1×CF)2
d) None of the mentioned
a
Vo(s) /V1(s) =-S×RF×C1/{[1+(RF CF)]×[1+(S×R1×C1)]}.
In a practical differentiator,  RFCF = R1C1
=> Vo(s) /V1(s) = -SRF×C1/(1+SRF×CF)2    or    Vo(s) /V1’(s) = -S×RF×C1/(1+R1×C1)2.
