1. Which factor affects the power supply voltages in amplifier?
a) Poor regulation and filtering
b) Resistive network connected to amplifier
c) Change in temperature
d) All of the mentioned
a
2. Change in the input bias current does not affect?
a) Input offset voltage
b) Output offset voltage
c) Input offset current
d) Output offset current
c
3. A supply voltage rejection ratio of 15µv/v is given for an op-amp. Find its equivalent value in decibels
a) 74db
b) 77dB
c) 76.48dB
d) 76dB
c
= 20log(1/150µV/V) =20log(106/150) =20log(6666.67)= 76.48dB. 
4. When does the op-amp perform better?
a) Low value of SVRR in µV/V
b) High value if SVRR in µV/V
c) Low value of SVRR in dB

5. Write the equation for change in the output offset voltage?
a) △Voo = [-RF/R1)]× [△Vio/△V] ×△V
b) △Voo = [1+(RF/R1)]× [△Vio/△V] ×△V
c)  △Voo = [1+(RF/R1)]× [△Vio/△V].
d) None of the mentioned
b
 △Voo =[1+(RF/R1)]× [△Vio/△V] × △V
Where, △V = Change in supply voltage +Vcc & -Vee,
△Vio/△V = Supply voltage rejection ratio (µV/V) and
[1+(RF/R1)] = Gain of the differential amplifier. 
6. A LM307 amplifier has SVRR of 92dB, express it in terms of microvolts per volts?
a) 65µV/V
b) 37.98µV/V
c) 25.12µV/V
d) 101.4µV/V
c
=> log(1/SVRR) = 92/20
=> 1/SVRR= 104.6
=> SVRR = 1/104.6 =25.12µV/V. 
7. Which value remain the same regardless of whether it is  computed from the change in low dc supply or change in +Vcc or  -Vee ?
a) △V
b) △Vio
c) △Voo
d) None of the mentioned
d
8. Consider LM307 is initially nulled. Suppose, the op-amp has poor filter, 20mVrms then ac ripple is measured across the terminals. If Vin=0v, determine the change in output offset voltage caused by the change in supply voltage?
a) 81µVrms
b) 8.1µVrms
c) 0.81µVrms
d) 810µVrms
b
The change in output offset voltage, △Voo =[1+(RF/R1)]× [△Vio/△V] ×△V = [1+(950kΩ/1kΩ)] × (15.85µV/V) × 910mv= 8.1µVrms.
