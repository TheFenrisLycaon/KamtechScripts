b) 15dB
c) 6dB
d) 12dB
d
|VO/Vin|≅12 dB
AF= 1+(RF /R1)= 1+(12kΩ/4kΩ) =4.
fL= 1/(2πRC) = 1/2π×15kΩ×0.047µF= 1/4.427×10-3 =225.86Hz.

a) 6.9kΩ
b) 5.86kΩ
c) 10kΩ
d) 12.56kΩ
b
=> AF= [1+(RF/R1)]
=> RF= (AF-1)×R1 =(1.586-1)×10kΩ =5860 =5.86kΩ. 
6. Consider the following circuit and calculate the low cut-off frequency value?
a) 178.7Hz
b) 89.3Hz
c) 127.65Hz
d) 255.38Hz
a
7. Determine voltage gain of second order high pass butterworth filter.

a) -11.78dB
b) -26.51dB
c) -44.19dB
d) None of the mentioned
c
=> C2 = 1/(2π ×fL×R2) = 1/(2π ×1kHz×33Ω)
=> C3 =C2= 4.82µF.
Voltage gain of filter |VO/Vin|=AF / [√ 1+(fL/f)4] = 1.586/[1+(1kHz/250kz)4] =1.586/252=6.17×10-3 =20log(6.17×10-3)= -44.19dB. 
8. From the given specifications, determine the value of voltage gain magnitude of first order and second order high pass butterworth filter?
Pass band voltage gain=2;
Low cut-off frequency= 1kHz;
Input frequency=500Hz.
a) First order high pass filter =-4.22dB , Second order high pass filter=-0.011dB
b) First order high pass filter =-0.9688dB , Second order high pass filter=-6.28dB
c) First order high pass filter =-11.3194dB , Second order high pass filter=-9.3257dB
d) First order high pass filter =-7.511dB , Second order high pass filter=-5.8999dB
b
|VO/Vin|=AF ×(f/fL) / [ √1+(f/fL)2] =(2×(500Hz/1kHz)) /√[1+(500Hz/1kHz)2]
=> |VO/Vin| = 1/1.118= 0.8944 =20log(0.8944) =-0.9686dB.
For second order high pass filter,
|VO/Vin|=AF / [ √ 1 +(fL/f)4] =2/√[1+ (1kHz/500Hz)2]
=>|VO/Vin|=2/4.123= =0.4851 = 20log(0.4851) = -6.28dB.

a) -160dB/decade
b) -320dB/decade
c) -480dB/decade
d) -200dB/decade
a
=>∴ for 8th order filter= 8×20=160dB/decade.
