6. Determine the high frequency model op-amp with single break frequency
a
7. The gain of the differential amplifier is -125. Assume the voltage applied to bridge circuit Vdc=+10v and the unstrained resistance of four element of strain gage is 200Ω. When a certain weight is placed on the platform, the output voltage Vo=5v. Determine the change in resistance of each strain gage for analog weight scale. (Assuming the output is initially nulled).
a) 1Ω
b) 0.8Ω
c) 0.3Ω
d) 1.83Ω
b
=> △R=( Vo/ Vdc)×(R1/RF)×R =( 5v×200Ω)/(125×10v) =0.8Ω. 
8. Assume that the increase and decrease in the resistance of the strain gage element is by the same number of △R. Determine the unbalanced voltage equation.
a) V = – Vdc×(△R/R)
b) V = – Vdc×(△R/R+△R)
c) V = Vdc×(△R/R)
d) V = – Vdc×[(△R+ R)/R].
