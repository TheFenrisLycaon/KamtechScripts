7. Find the difference between output current having  a load of 100Ω and 120Ω for 7805 IC regulator. Consider the following specification: Voltage across the load = 5v; Voltage across the internal resistor= 350mv.
a) 8.4mA
b) 7mA
c) 9mA
d) 3.4mA
a
When load = 100Ω, IL= IO= Ii= 5v/100 Ω = 50mA
When load=120Ω, IO= 5v/120 Ω = 41.6mA.
So, the difference between the output voltage = 50-41.6mA = 8.4mA. 
8. The change in output voltage for the corresponding change in load current in a 7805 IC regulator is defined as
a) All of the mentioned
b) Line regulation

c
9. An IC 7840 regulator has an output current =180mA and internal resistor =10Ω. Find the collector current in the output using the transistor specification: ß=15 and VEB(ON) =1.5v.
a) 270mA
b) 450mA
c) 100mA
d) 50mA
b
Where, IB= IO-(VEB(ON)/R1) = 180mA-(1.5v-10Ω) = 0.03A.
Therefore, IC= 15×0.03 = 0.45A = 450mA. 
10. How the average temperature coefficient of output voltage expressed in fixed voltage regulator?

b) miilivoltsoC
c) None of the mentioned

a
11. In the circuit given below, let VEB(ON)=0.8v and ß=16. Calculate the output current coming from 7805 IC and collector current coming from transistor Q1 for a  load  of 5Ω.
a) IO =111mA, IC= 808mA
b) IO =111mA, IC= 829mA
c) IO =111mA, IC= 881mA
d) IO =111mA, IC= 889mA
d
Therefore, IL =(ß+1)IO-[ß×(VEB(ON)/R1)
IO = [IL/(ß+1)]+ [ß×(VEB(ON)/R1) = [1/(16+1)]+[16×(0.8/2Ω)] ≅111mA.
=> IC=IL-IO=1A-111mA =889mA. 
12. Calculate the output voltage for LM314 regulator. The current IADJ is very small in the order of 100µA. (Assume VREF=1.25v)
a) 17.17v
b) 34.25v
c) 89.34v
d) 23.12v
a
=> VO=17.17v. 
13. Compute the input voltage of 7805c voltage regulator with a current source that will deliver a 0.725A current to 65Ω, 10w load. (Assume reference voltage =5v)
a) Vin = 84v
b) Vin = 34v
c) Vin = 54v
d) Vin = 64v
c
=> Input voltage, Vin = VO + dropout voltage = 52.125v+2v.
=> Vin ≅54v. 
14. Which of the following is not a characteristic of adjustable voltage regulators?
a) Non-versatile
b) Better performance
c) Increased reliability
d) None of the mentioned
a
