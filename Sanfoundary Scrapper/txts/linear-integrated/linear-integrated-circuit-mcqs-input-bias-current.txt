a
7. Name the resistor that is connected in the non-inverting terminal of op-amp which is in parallel combination of resistor connected in inverting terminal and feedback resistor.
a) Random minimizing resistor
b) Offset minimizing resistor
c) Offset reducing resistors
d) Output minimizing resistors
b
8. Calculate ROM, if the value of IB1 = IB2 in the given circuit.
a) 1173.11Ω
b) 171.31Ω
c) 1171.43Ω
d) 1071.43Ω
d
=> ROM = (1.2kΩ*10kΩ)/(1.2kΩ+10Ω) = 1071.43Ω.
9.  Calculate the output voltage for the given circuit using the specification: R1 = 820Ω; ROM=811.882Ω; Vin=10mVpp; VOIB≅0.
a) 1.025Vpp
b) 1.8Vpp
c) 1Vpp
d) 2Vpp
c
=> RF = (ROM* R1)/( R1– ROM) = (812Ω*811.882Ω)/(820Ω-811.882Ω) = 82kΩ.
∴ Vo = -(RF/ R1)* Vin = -(82kΩ/820Ω)*10mVpp = 1Vpp.
10. Analyse the given circuit and determine the correct option
a)  Voo ≥  VIOB
b) Voo =  VIOB
c) Voo  >>  VIOB
d) Voo  <<  VIOB
c
The output offset voltage due to input offset voltage is given as Voo =[1+(RF/R1)]*Vio = [1+(4.7kΩ/47Ω)]*6mv = 0.606v.
The output offset voltage due to input bias current is given as VIOB = RF*IB =4.7kΩ*500nA = 2.35mv.
=>∴ Voo  >>  VIOB.
11. The specification for LM101A op-amp is given as IB =75nA. Determine the value of VIOB– V1.
a) 0.112v
b) 0.750v
c) 0.374v
d) 0.634v
a
=> ∵ ROM = (R1*RF)/(R1+ RF) = (15kΩ*150Ω)/(15kΩ+150Ω) =148Ω
The output offset voltage is given as VIOB = RF*IB
=> VIOB = 15kΩ*7.5nA = 112.5mv
=> ∴ VIOB– V1 = 0.112v.
