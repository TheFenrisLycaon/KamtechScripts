1. The maximum amount by which the two input bias current may differ is known as
a) Input null current
b) Average input bias current
c) Input offset current
d) None of the mentioned
c
2. A 741 type op-amp has a maximum input offset current of 200nA dc. What conclusion can be derived from this statement?
{ IB1 – Input bias current at inverting input terminal and IB2 – Input bias current at non-inverting input terminal}
a) IB1 may be larger than IB2 by 200nA
b) IB2 may be larger than IB1 by 200nA
c) Iio and IB2 may be equal to  200nA
d) All of the mentioned
d
3.  The maximum magnitude of the output offset voltage is
a) VOIio = RF*Iio
b) VOIio = RF*( IB1+IB2)
c) VOIio = RF*IB1
d) VOIio = RF*( IB1-IB2)
a
4. Find the output offset voltage of an 741 op-amp; If the gain of the non-inverting amplifier is 8.5 and feedback resistor = 15kΩ? (IB=200nA for 741 op-amp)
a) 1µv
b) 4 µv
c) 3 µv
d) 2 µv
c
Gain, A=1+(RF/R1)
=> R1 = RF/(A-1) = 15kΩ/(8.5-1) = 2kΩ.
=> ROM =(R1* RF)/( R1+RF) = 1.76kΩ.
The output offset voltage, VOIB1= VOIB= RF*IB
=> VOIB1=  1.76kΩ*200nA*8.5 = 2.9×10-6 ≅ 3 µv.
5. Find out the input offset current from the circuit
a) Iio = |IBA*IBC|
b) Iio = |IBA+ IBC|
c) Iio = |IBA/ IBC|
d) Iio = |IBA– IBC|
d
6. Determine the maximum output offset voltage caused by input offset current
a) 5.4mv
b) 7.3mv
c) 6.9mv
d) 8.1mv
a
=> Therefore, VOIio = RF*Iio = 27kΩ*200nA =5.4mv.
7. Find the total output offset voltage of non-inverting op-amp?
a) VooT = {[1+(RF/R1)]*Vio} + RF*Iio
b) VooT = -[(RF/R1)*Vio] + RF*Iio
c) VooT = -[(RF/R1)*Vio] + Iio
d) None of the mentioned
b
8. Analyse the circuit and determine the value of total output offset voltage?
The op-amp is the MC1536 with the following specifications:
Vio = 7.5mv, Iio = 5nA, IB =250nA.
a) 0.12v
b) 1.4v
c) 0.76v
d) 8.5v
c
=> VooT = [1+(47kΩ/470Ω)]*7.5mv+(47kΩ*50nA) = 0.7598 ≅ 0.76v.
