1. Choose the compensating network design for non-inverting amplitude
a
2. Find the thevenin’s equivalent for resistance and voltage?
a) 1-iii, 2-ii, 3-1
b) 1-ii, 2-I, 3-iii
c) 1-I, 2-ii, 3-iii
d) 1-ii, 2-iii, 3-i
b
3. What is done to compensate the voltage, when V1 > V2?
a) Move the wiper towards +Vcc
b) Move the wiper towards –Vee
c) Keep the wiper at the center of potentiometer
d) None of the mentioned
a
4. Calculate the maximum thevenin equivalent resistance, if a 10kΩ potentiometer is used?
a) 0.4kΩ
b) 5 kΩ
c) 2.5kΩ
d) 4kΩ
c
Given potentiometer, Ra = 10kΩ
=> Therefore, Rmax = 10kΩ/4 =2.5kΩ.
5. Find the input offset voltage for the circuit shown
a) Vio = (Rb*Vmax)/( Rmax+ Rb+ Rc)
b) Vio = Rmax/( Rmax+ Rb+ Rc)
c) Vio = (Rc*Vmax)/( Rmax+ Rb+ Rc)
d) Vio = Vmax/( Rmax+ Rb+ Rc)
c
6.  Find the value of Ra and Rb from the circuit shown?
a) Ra =4.6kΩ ; Rb= 9kΩ
b) Ra =7.3kΩ ; Rb= 3.4kΩ
c) Ra =2.5kΩ ; Rb= 5.1kΩ
d) Ra =4kΩ ; Rb= 10kΩ
d
=> Rb = Vmax*(Rc / Rb ) = (10v/10mv)*10Ω (∵ Vio specified on the datasheet is 10mv for LM307 op-amp).
=> Rb =10000 = 10kΩ.
Since Rb > Rmax let us choose Rb = 10*Rmax. (Where Rmax = Ra/4).
∴ Rb = (10*Rb)/4  and Ra = Rb/2.5 = 10kΩ/2.5=4kΩ.
7. Why does an op-amp without feedback is not used in linear circuit application?
a) Due to high current gain
b) Due to high voltage gain
c) Due to high output signal
d) All of the mentioned
b
8. When the input voltage is reduced to zero in a closed loop configuration the circuit acts as
a) Inverting amplifier
b) Non-inverting amplifier
c) Inverting and non-inverting amplifier
d) None of the mentioned
c
If the non-inverting input terminal is connected to ground, it acts as inverting op-amp and vice versa.
9.  How the value of output offset voltage is reduced in closed loop op-amp?
a) By increasing gain
b) By reducing gain
c) By decreasing bandwidth
d) By reducing bandwidth
b
