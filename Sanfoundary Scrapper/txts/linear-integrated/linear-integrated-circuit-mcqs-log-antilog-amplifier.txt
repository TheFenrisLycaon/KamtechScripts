1. Which of the following functions does the antilog computation required to perform continuously with log-amps?
a) In(x)
b) log(x)
c) Sinh(x)
d) All of the mentioned
d
2. Find the circuit that is used to compress the dynamic range of a signal?
a
3. Find the output voltage of the log-amplifier
a) VO = -(kT)×ln(Vi/Vref)
b) VO = -(kT/q)×ln(Vi/Vref)
c) VO = -(kT/q)×ln(Vref/Vi)
d) VO = (kT/q)×ln(Vi/Vref)
b
VO =-(kT/q)×ln(Vi / Vref).
4. How to provide saturation current and temperature compensation in log-amp?
a) Applying reference voltage alone to two different log-amps
b) Applying input and reference voltage to same log-amps
c) Applying input and reference voltage to separate log-amps
d) None of the mentioned
c
5. The input voltage, 6v and reference voltage, 4 v are applied to a log-amp with saturation current and temperature compensation.  Find the output voltage of the log-amp?
a) 6.314(kT/q)v
b) 0.597(kT/q)v
c) 0.405(kT/q)v
d) 1.214(kT/q)v
c
VO = 0.405(kT/q)v. 
6. Find the  circuit used for compensating dependency of temperature in the output voltage?
c
Now the output voltage becomes,VO = [1+ (R2/ RTC)]×[(kT/q)×ln(Vi / Vref)]
Where, RTC –> temperature sensitive resistance with a positive co-efficient of temperature. 
7. Determine the output voltage for the given circuit
a) VO = Vref/(10-k’vi)
b) VO = Vref+(10-k’vi)
c) VO = Vref×(10-k’vi)
d) VO = Vref-(10-k’vi)
c
 Where k’ = 0.4343 (q/kt)×[(RTC/ (R2 +RTC)].
8. Calculate the base voltage of Q2 transistor in the log-amp using two op-amps?
a) 8.7v
b) 5.3v
c) 3.3v
d) 6.2v
c
