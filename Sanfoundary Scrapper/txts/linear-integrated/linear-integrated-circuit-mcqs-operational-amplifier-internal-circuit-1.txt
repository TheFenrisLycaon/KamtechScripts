b) VO1=12v ,  VO2=3.9v
c) VO1=12v ,  VO2=0v
d) VO1=3.9v ,  VO2=-3.9v
b
⇒ VO1 = VCC 	VO2= VCC-αF×IQ×RC,
⇒ VO1 = 12v , VO2=12v-1×3mA×2.7k = 3.9v.

11. Find collector current IC2, given input voltages are V1=2.078v & V2=2.06v and total current IQ=2.4mA. (Assume α=1)
a) 0.8mA
b) 1.6mA
c) 0.08mA
d) 0.16mA
a
VT = Volts equivalent of temperature = 25mv,
	⇒ Vd = V1-V2   =2.078v-2.06v=0.018v    (equ1)
Substituting equation 1,
	 ⇒ Vd/VT  = 0.018v/25mv  =   0.72v (equ2)
Substituting equation 2,
	⇒ IC2= 1×2.4mA/(1+e0.72)  =  2.4mA/(1+2.05)  = 0.8mA.
12. A differential amplifier has a transistor with β0= 100, is biased at ICQ = 0.48mA. Determine the value of CMRR and ACM, if RE =7.89kΩ and RC = 5kΩ.
a) 49.54 db
b) 49.65 d
c) 49.77 db
d) 49.60 db
b
⇒ ACM= -(gmRC)/(1+2gmRE)
(for β0≫1).
Substituting the values,
⇒ gm= ICQ/VT =  0.48mA/25mv=19.2×10-3Ω-1
⇒ ADM= -gm×RC= -19.2×10-3Ω-1×5kΩ= -96
⇒ ACM= -(gmRC)/(1+2gmRE)= -(19.2×10-3Ω-1×5kΩ) /(1+2×-⇒ 19.2×10-3Ω-1×7.89kΩ)  = -0.3158
CMRR = -96/-0.3158= 303.976
    =20log⁡303.976
    =49.65db
