1. Which circuit can be used as a full wave rectifier?
a) Absolute vale output circuit
b) Positive clipper with two diodes
c) Negative clipper with two diodes
d) Peak clampers
a
2. For the circuit shown below find the output voltage
a) Vo (+) = +10 v
b) Vo (+) = +12v
c) Vo (+) = +7v
d) None of the mentioned
b
V1 = (12-0.7) /2 = 5.65 v	 (Vd1= voltage drop across diode=0.7)
Similarly, the voltage at the negative terminal V2 = (Vo -Vd3 ) /2 = (Vo – 0.7) /2
 Since Vid ≅ 0v , ∴ V1 = V2
  Vo = (5.65 *2 ) + 0.7 = 12v. 
3. Determine the output waveform for the circuit
Where input = 2 Vp sine wave with time period 0.2ms.
a
Therefore, Vo (+) = Vo (-) = 2 Vp sine wave with 0.2 ms time period. So, the output wave form will be a full wave rectified output of 2v amplitude, 
4. What is the alternate method to measure the values of non-sinusoidal waveform other than ac voltmeter?
a) Clipper
b) Clamper
c) Peak detector
d) Comparator
c
5. State the condition needed to be satisfied by peak detector for proper operation of circuit.
a) CRd ≤ T/10 and CRL ≥ 10T
b) CRd ≤ 10T and CRL ≥ T/10
c) CRd ≥ T/10 and CRL ≤ 10T
d) CRd ≥ 10T and CRL ≤ T/10
a
