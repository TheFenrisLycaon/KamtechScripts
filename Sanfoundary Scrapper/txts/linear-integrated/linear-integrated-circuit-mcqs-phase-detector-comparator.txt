1. Analog phase detector is often referred as
a) Full wave detector
b) Half wave detector
c) Rectifier wave detector
d) None of the mentioned
b
2. What happens when VCO output is 90o out of phase with respect to input signal?
a) Perfect lock
b) Attenuation
c) Shift in phase of comparator
d) Error signal is removed
a
3. Find the error voltage of phase comparator whose input signal is Vs= Vssin(2πfst) and the output signal Vo= Vosin(2πfot+φ).
a) Ve=[k×(Vs/2)]×[cos(-φ)-cos(2πfot+φ)].
b) Ve=[k×Vs×(Vo/2)]×[cos(-φ)-cos(2πfot+φ)].
c) Ve=[k×Vs×(Vo/2)]×[cos(-φ)+cos(2πfot+φ)].
d) Ve=[k×Vs×Vo]×[cos(-φ)-cos(2πfot+φ)].
b
Where k – phase comparator gain.= k×Vs×Vo/2[cos(-φ)-cos(2πfot+φ)]
When at lock, fs =fo
=> Ve = Ve={k×Vs× Vo/2}x[cos(-φ)-cos(2πfot+φ)]. 
4. How to overcome the problem associated with switch type phase detective?
a) Increase loop gain depending on input signal
b) Phase shift is made linear
c) Limit the amplifier of input signal
d) All of the mentioned
c
5. If the average error voltage & the phase shift are given as 6.2v & π/4.Determine the phase angle to voltage transfer coefficient of full wave switching phase detector.
a) -0.19
b) -0.09
c) -0.03
d) -0.13
d
=>kφ = (φ-π/2)/ Ve (avg) =[π/4-π/2]/6.2 =[π-2π/4]/6.2 = -(π/4)/6.2 = -π/24.8
=>kφ = -0.13. 
6. When does a digital phase detector can be used, where fo->output frequency, fs->input frequency.
a) Both fo & fs signals should be square wave
