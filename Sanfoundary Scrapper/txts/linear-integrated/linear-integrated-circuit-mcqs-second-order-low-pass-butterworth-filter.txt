1. How can a first order low pass filter can be converted into second order low pass filter
a) By adding LC network
b) By adding RC network
c) By adding RC || LC network
d) None of the mentioned
b
2. Consider the following specifications and calculate the high cut-off frequency for the circuit given?
a) 95Hz
b) 48Hz
c) 14Hz
d) 33Hz
d
= 1/[2π√(33kΩ×15kΩ×0.47µF×0.1µF)]= 1/[2π× 4.82×(10-3)]= 33Hz. 
3. Find the gain and phase angle of the second order low pass filter?
Where pass band gain of the filter is 5, frequency and the high cut-off frequency of the filter are 3000Hz and 1kHz.
a) None of the mentioned
b) Gain magnitude = -1.03dB , φ =63.32o
c) Gain magnitude = -5.19dB , φ =71.56o
d) Gain magnitude = -4.94dB , φ =90o
c
=> [VO /Vin] = 20log(0.55) =-.519dB.
Phase angle of second order low pass filter is given as φ= tan-1(f/fH)
=> φ =71.56o. 
4. Design a second order low pass butterworth filter at a high cut-off frequency of 2.2kHz. Given RF=20kΩ and capacitor 0.047µF.
c
R3 = 1/(2πfHC3 = 1/(2π×2.2kHz×0.047µF) =1/5.9032×10-4 =1.69kΩ.
=>R3 =R2=1.67kΩ
Since, RF=0.586R1
=> R1=RF/0.586 =20kΩ/0.586
 R1 = 34.13kΩ. 
5. A second order low pass filter is given an input frequency of 30kHz and produce a output having phase angle of 79o. Determine the pass band gain of the filter?
a) 11 dB
b) 89.11 dB
c) 46.78 dB
d)  None of the mentioned
c
=> fh =f×tan(φ) =30kHz × tan(79)= 154.34kHz.
Therefore, the pass band gain AF = fH/0.707 = 154.34kHz/0.707
AF= 218.3 =20log(218.3)= 46.78dB. 
6. The pass band voltage gain of a second order low pass butterworth filter is
a) 1.586
b) 8.32
c) 0.586
d) 0.707
a
7. Arrange the series of step involved in designing a filter for first order low pass filter
Step 1: Select a value of C less than or equal to 1µF
Step 2: Choose a value of high cut-off frequency fH
Step 3: Select a value of R1C and RF depending on the desired pass band gain
Step 4: Calculate the value of R
a) Steps- 2->4->3->1
b) Steps- 4->1->3->2
c) Steps- 2->1->4->3
d) Steps- 1->3->4->2
b
8. Frequency scaling is done using
a) Standard capacitor
b) Varying capacitor
c) Standard resistance
d) None of the mentioned
a
