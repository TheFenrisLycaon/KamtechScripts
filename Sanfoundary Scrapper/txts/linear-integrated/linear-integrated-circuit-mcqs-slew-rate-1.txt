c) Both output input voltage with respect to time
d)  None of the mentioned
a
2. How the slew rate is represented?
a) 1V/ms
b) 1V/s
c) 1V/µs
d) 1mv/S
c
3. The natural semiconductor LH0063C has a slew rate of
a) 1400V/µs
b) 6000V/µs
c) 500V/µs
d) None of the mentioned
b
4. Rise time is specified for
a) Large signal
b) Medium signal
c) Small signal
d) All of the mentioned
c
5. Op-amps with wide bandwidth will have
a) Increase in output
b) Higher slew rate
c) Low response time
d) None of the mentioned
b
6. Which factor is responsible for causing slew rate?
a) Internal capacitor
b) External resistor
c) None of the mentioned
d) Both internal and external capacitor
d
7. Find the value of capacitor, if the rate of change of voltage across the capacitor is 0.78V/µs and current= 12µA.
a) 5µF
b) 2µF
c) 10µF
d) 15µF
d
=> C= I/ (dVc/ dt)  = 12µA/0.78V/µs = 15.38 ≅15µF. 
8. Find the slew rate of op-amp from the output waveform given below?
a) 3.4V/µs
b) 10V/µs
c) 20.66V/µs
d) 16V/µs
c
SR = 3.1-(-3.1v)/ (0.6/2)µs  =6.3/0.3 = 20.66Vµs. 
9. For the circuit shown below, calculate the rate of change of output signal
a) Vm ωcosωt
b) Vm cosωt
c) Vm cosωt/ωt
d) Vm cosωt/ω
a
=> Vo= Vmsinωt
=>∴  the rate of change of the output voltage = dVo /dt= d(Vmsinωt)/ dt = Vm ωcosωt. 
10. At what condition, the output of op-amp will be free of distortion?
a) Slew rate > 2πfVm /106 V/µs
