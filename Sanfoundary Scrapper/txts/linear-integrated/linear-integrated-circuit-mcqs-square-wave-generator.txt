b
4. Determine capacitor voltage waveform for the circuit
c
Similarly, when the op-amp’s output voltage is at positive saturation, V1 =  [(R1) / (R1+ R2 )] × (+Vsat) = [10kΩ/ ( 10 kΩ +11.6 kΩ)] × (+15v) = +7v
The time period of the output waveform,T= 2RC ln ×[( 2R1+ R2) / ( R2)] = 2× 10kΩ × 0.05 µF× ln (2×10kΩ + 11.6kΩ) / 11.6kΩ] = 1×10-3 × ln2.724 = 1ms.
The voltage across the capacitor will be a triangular wave form.

a) fo = (1/2RC)
b) fo = (ln/2RC)
c) fo = (ln /2 ×√RC)
d) fo = (ln/√(2 RC))
b
6. What could be the possible output waveform for a free running multivibrator whose op-amp has a supply voltage of ±5v operating at 5khz?
c
=> Frequency= 5khz   , f =1/t = 0.2ms. 
7. Determine the output frequency for the circuit given below

a) 3.9 µF
b) 0.3 µF
c) 2 µF
d) 0.05µF
d
=> C = 1/2Rfo = 1/ (2×10kΩ×1khz) = 0.05µF.
