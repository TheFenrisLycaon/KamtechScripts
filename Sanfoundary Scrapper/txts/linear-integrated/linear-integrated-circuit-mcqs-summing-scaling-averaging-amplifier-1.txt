1. In which amplifier the output voltage is equal to the negative sum of all the inputs?
a) Averaging amplifier
b) Summing amplifier
c) Scaling amplifier
d) All of the mentioned
b
2. Determine the expression of output voltage for inverting summing amplifier consisting of four internal resistors? (Assume the value of internal resistors to be equal)
a) Vo = -(Rf/R )×(Va +Vb+Vc+Vd)
b) Vo =  (RF/R)×(Va +Vb+Vc+Vd)
c) Vo =  (R/ RF)×(Va +Vb+Vc+Vd)
d) None of the mentioned
a
Then, the output voltage for inverting amplifier is given as Vo= -(Rf/R)×(Va +Vb+Vc+Vd). 
3. An inverting amplifier with gain 1 have different input voltage: 1.2v,3.2v and 4.2v. Find the output voltage?
a) 4.2v
b) 8.6v
c) -4.2v
d) -8.6v
d
VO= -(Va+Vb+Vc) =-(1.2+3.2+4.2)= -8.6v. 
4. In which type of amplifier, the input voltage is amplified by a scaling factor
a) Summing amplifier
b) Averaging amplifier
c) Weighted amplifier
d) Differential amplifier
c
5. An inverting scaling amplifier has three input voltages Va, Vb and Vc. Find it output voltage?
a) VO= – {[(RF/Ra)×Va] +[(RF/Rb)×Vb]+[(RF/Rc)×Vc]}
b) VO= – [(RF/Ra)+(RF/Rb)+(RF/Rc)]×[( Va +Vb+Vc)].
c)  VO = – {[(Ra/RF)×Va] +[(Rb/RF)×Vb]+[(Rc/RF)×Vc]}
d) None of the mentioned
a
=> ∴ RF/Ra ≠ RF/Rb ≠ RF/Rc
Therefore, output voltage Vo = -{[(RF/Ra) Va] +[(RF/Rb) Vb]+[(RF/Rc) Vc]}. 
6. An amplifier in which the output voltage is equal to average of input voltage?
a) Summing amplifier
b) Weighting amplifier
c) Scaling amplifier
d) Averaging amplifier
d
7. Find out the gain value  by which each input of the averaging amplifier is amplified ?( Assume there are four inputs)
a) 0.5
b) 0.25
c) 1
d) 2
b
=> RF /R =1/n , where n=number of inputs
∴ RF /R=1/4 = 0.25 (Four inputs)
So, each input in the averaging amplifier must be amplified by 0.25. 
8. 3v, 5v and 7v are the three input voltage applied to the inverting input terminal of averaging amplifier. Determine the output voltage?
a) -5v
b) -10v
c) -15v
d) -20v
a
9. The following circuit represents an inverting scaling amplifier. Compute the value of RoM and VO?
a) VO = -0.985v ; RoM = 111.11Ω
b) VO = -2.567v ; RoM = 447.89Ω
c) VO = -1.569v ; RoM = 212.33Ω
d) VO = -1.036v ; RoM = 320.56Ω
d
= – {[(10kΩ/1kΩ)×3.3mv] + [(10kΩ/1.25kΩ)×5mv] + [(10kΩ/820Ω)×7.9mv]} = -1.036v.
RoM = [Ra||Rbc||RF]
= [(Ra×Rb)/(Ra+ Rb)] || [(Rc×RF)/( Rc+ RF)] = [(1kΩ×1.25kΩ)/(1kΩ+1.25kΩ)] || [(820Ω×10kΩ)/(820Ω+10kΩ)] = 555.55||757.85 =[(555.55 ×757.85)/(555.55+757.85)] = 320.56Ω.
