13. Find the value of Rsc, L and Co for a µA7840 switching regulator to provide +5 v at 3A, using the following specifications: toff= 24µs, ripple voltage = 400mA and ton=26µs.
a) Rsc = 55 mΩ , L = 25µH  & Co = 750µF
b) Rsc = 550 mΩ , L = 25µH  & Co = 75µF
c) Rsc = 650 mΩ , L = 25µH  & Co = 65µF
d) Rsc = 720 mΩ , L = 25µH  & Co = 250µF
a
∴ Rsc = 0.33ohm/Ipk = 0.33ohm/6   = 0.055ohm.
=> L= [(Vo +Vp) / I pk]×toff =[(5+1.25) /6 ]× 24×10-6 =25µH.
=> Co = [Ipk (Ton +Toff)]/[8×Vripple]
 ∵T = [ton + toff] = 26µs + 24µs = 50µs
=> Co = [ (6×50µs)]/(8×50mA) = 7.5×10-4 = 750µF. 
14. Calculate the efficiency of the step down switching regulator given the input voltage Vin= 13.5v and output voltage =6v. Assume the saturating Voltage Vs=1.1v and the forward voltage drop Vd = 1.257v
a) η = 75%
b) η = 48.5%
c) η = 63.9%
d) η = 80.5%
d
=> Efficiency of switching regulator, η = (1.012×0.7955)×100 = 0.8051×100 = 80.5%.
