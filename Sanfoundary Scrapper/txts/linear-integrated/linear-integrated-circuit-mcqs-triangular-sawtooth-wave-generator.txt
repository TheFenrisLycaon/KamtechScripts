d
2. The increase in the frequency of triangular wave generator.
a) Ramp the amplitude of triangular wave
b) Increase the amplitude of triangular wave
c) Decrease the amplitude of triangular wave
d) None of the mentioned
a
3. Which among the following op-amp is chosen for generating triangular wave of relatively higher frequency?
a) LM741 op-amp
b) LM301 op-amp
c) LM1458 op-amp
d) LM3530 op-amp
b
4. What is the peak to peak (PP) output amplitude of the triangular wave?
a) VO(pp) =  + VRamp + (- VRamp)
b) VO(pp) =  – VRamp + (+ VRamp)
c) VO(pp) =  + VRamp – (- VRamp)
d) VO(pp) =  – VRamp – (+ VRamp)
c
Where,   – VRamp –> Negative going ramp ;
    + VRamp–> positive  going ramp. 
5. Determine the output triangular waveform for the circuit.
b
=>   -Vramp =(-R2 / R3) × (+Vsat)
= (-10kΩ/40kΩ) ×15v =-3.75v
Similarly, the voltage at which A1 switch from -Vsat to +Vsat
=> +Vramp = (-R2 / R3) × (-Vsat)
= 10kΩ/40kΩ ×15v =3.75v
∴ Time period, T = (4R1C1R2) / R3
 = (4×10kΩ×0.05µF×10kΩ) /40kΩ = 0.5 ms. 
6.  Find the capacitor value for a the output frequency,  fo = 2kHz & VO(pp) = 7v , in a triangular wave generator. The op-amp is 1458/741 and supply voltage = ±15v. (Take internal resistor=10kΩ)
a) 0.03nF
b) 30nF
c) 0.3nF
d) 3nF
d
∴  VO(pp) = (2R2/R3) × Vsat
=> R2 =(VO(pp) ×R3) / (Vsat×2) = [7/(2×15)]×R3 = 0.233R3
∵ Internal resistor, R2 = R1= 10kΩ
=> R3 = 0.233×10kΩ = 2.33kΩ.
So, the output frequency fO = R3 / ( 4×R1 ×C1× R2)
=>  2khz = 2.33khz/ (4×10kΩ ×10kΩ×C1)
=> C1 = 2.33kΩ / (8×10-11)  = 2.9 ×10-9 ≅3nF.
