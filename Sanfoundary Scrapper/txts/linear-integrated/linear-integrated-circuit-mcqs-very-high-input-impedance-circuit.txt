b) Op-amp with higher slew rate
c) Buffer or voltage follower
d) All of the mentioned
d
4. What must be done to block the ac input voltage riding on a dc level?
a) Use RC network
b) Use coupling capacitor
c) Use resistive transducer
d) None of the mentioned
b
5. To get higher input resistance in AC coupled voltage follower,
a) The output resistance is bootstrapped
b) The input resistance is bootstrapped
c) The bias resistance is bootstrapped
d) The feedback resistance is bootstrapped
c
6. Find out AC-coupled voltage follower?
b
7. Voltage follower circuit are used in
a) Active filter
b) All of the mentioned
c) Sample and hold circuit
d) Bridge circuit with transducer
b
8. Compute the reference voltage for a fundamental log-amp, if it’s internal resistance=5MΩ.
a) 0.5µv
b) 0.05µv
c) 5µv
d) None of the mentioned
a
Where, Is~10-13A (for an emitter saturation current).
∴ Vref = 10-13 × 5MΩ = 5×10-7 = 0.5µv.
