1. Which device is used for diagnostic purposes and for recording?
a) Low pass filter
b) Monolithic PLL
c) Voltage Controlled Oscillator
d) None of the mentioned
c
2. If the output of the Schmitt trigger is given below. Estimate the output at the pin 3 of VCO.
a
3. Write the equation for time period of VCO?
a) (2×Vcc×CT)/i
b) (Vcc CT)/(2×i)
c) (Vcc×CT×i)/2
d) (2×Vcc)/(i×CT)
b
4. Determine the value of current flow in VCO, when the NE566 VCO external timing resistor RT =250Ω and the modulating input voltage Vc=3.25V.(Assume Vcc=+5v).
a) 3mA
b) 12mA
c) 7mA
d) 10mA
c
=>i =7mA. 
5. From the circuit given, find the value of output frequency?
a) 178.484 Hz
b) 104.84 Hz
c) 145.84 Hz
d) 110.88 Hz
b
=> fo=104.84 Hz. 
6. The output frequency of the VCO can be changed by changing
a) External tuning resistor
b) External tuning capacitor
c) Modulating input voltage
d) All of the mentioned
d
From the equation, it is clear that the fo is inversely proportional to CT & RT and directly proportional to Vc.Therefore, the output frequency can be changed by changing either voltage control, CT or RT. 
7. Calculate the value of external timing capacitor, if no modulating input signal is applied to VCO. Consider fo=25 kHz and RT=5 kΩ.
a) 6nF
b) 100µF
c) 2nF
d) 10nF
c
=> CT =1/(4×RT×fo) =1/(4×5kΩ×25kHz) = 2×10-9 =2nF. 
8.  What is the advantage of using filter?
a) High noise immunity
b) Reduce the bandwidth of PLL
c) Provides dynamic range of frequencies
d) None of the mentioned
a
9. Which filter is used in VCO?
d
10. Choose the VCO for attaining higher output frequency.
a) NE566
b) SE566
c) MC4024
d) All of the mentioned
c
11. Voltage to frequency conversion factor for VCO is
a) Kv = △Vc/ △fo
b) Kv = △fo/△Vc
c) Kv = △fo × △Vc
d) Kv = 1/(△fo×△Vc)
b
=>  Kv=△fo/△Vc.
12. Calculate the voltage to frequency conversion factor, where fo=155Hz and Vcc=10V.
a) 130
b) 124
c) 134
d) 116
b
13. Find the equation for change in frequency of VCO?
a) △fo = (2×△Vc)/(RT×CT×Vcc)
b) △fo = △Vc/(4×RT×CT×Vcc)
c) △fo = △Vc/(2×RT×CT×Vcc)
d) △fo = (4×△Vc)/(RT×CT×Vcc)
a
The new frequency f1 =2×[Vcc-Vc]/[RT×CT×Vcc].
Change in frequency, △fo= fo– f1 = 2×[Vcc-Vc+△Vc]/[RT×CT×Vcc]-{2×[Vcc-Vc]/[ RT×CT×Vcc]
=> △fo = (2×△Vc)/(RT×CT×Vcc). 
14. Using the given specifications, determine the voltage to frequency conversion factor.
a) 8.32
b) 8.90
c) 8.51
d) 8.75
c
=>△Vc= (△fo×RT×CT×Vcc)/2 = (4.7µFx10kΩx5x112)/2 = 13.16V.
Kv= △fo/ △Vc = 112Hz/13.16V
=>Kv=8.51.
