1. Which circuit converts irregularly shaped waveform to regular shaped waveforms?
a) Schmitt trigger
b) Voltage limiter
c) Comparator
d) None of the mentioned
a
2. Determine the upper and lower threshold voltage
a) VUT = +14.63v,  VLT= +14.63v
b) VUT = -14.63v,  VLT= -14.63v
c) VUT = VLT= ±14.63v
d) None of the mentioned
b
Lower threshold voltage VLT = [R1/(R1+ R2)]×( -Vsat) = [10kΩ /(10kΩ+250Ω)]×(-15v)= -14.63v. 
3. What happens if the threshold voltages are made longer than the noise voltages in schmitt trigger?
a) All the mentioned
b) Enhance the output signal
c) Reduce the transition effect
d) Eliminate false output transition
d
4. To a schmitt trigger in non-inverting configuration an input triangular wave of 1Vp is applied. What will be the output waveform, if the upper and lower threshold voltages are 0.25v?
a) Square waveform
b) Pulse waveform
c) Sawtooth waveform
d) Cannot be determined
a
5. In which configuration a dead band condition occurs in schmitt trigger
a) Differential amplifier with positive feedback
b) Voltage follower with positive feedback
c) Comparator with positive feedback
d) None of the mentioned
c
6. Calculate the hysteresis voltage for the schmitt trigger from the given specification:
 R2 =56kΩ , R1 = 100Ω ,Vref = 0v &  Vsat = ±14v.
a) 0 mv
b) 25 mv
c) 50 mv
d) -25 mv
c
Lower threshold voltage VLT = [R1/(R1+ R2)]×(-Vsat) = [100kΩ /(56kΩ+100Ω)]×(-14v)= -25 mv.
∴ Hysteresis voltage =   VUT-VLT = 25-(-25) = 50mv. 
7. How to limit the output voltage swing only to positive direction?
a) Combination of two zener diodes
b) Combination of zener and rectifier diode
c) All of the mentioned
d) Combination of two rectifier diodes
b
8. For the circuit shown below, obtain output waveform. Assume zener voltage to be 4.78v and voltage drop across the forward biased zener to be 0.7v.
a
∴ (VZ +VD1) = 4.78 v+0.7 v = 5.5 v.
Similarly, during negative half cycle of the input wave form, the output voltage is equal to – (VZ +VD2) as the diode D2 would be in forward bias) , – (VZ +VD2) =- 4.78 v-0.7 v = -5.5 v.
9. A basic op-amp circuit has a zener and rectifier diode connected in the feedback path. Calculate the maximum positive voltage. Where, zener voltage = 5.1 v and voltage drop across the forward biased zener = 0.7v?
a) VO =  5.8v
b) VO =  9.9v
c) VO =  4.7v
d) VO =  7.1v
d
=> VO= 5.1v+0.7 v= 5.8v.
10. Use the specification and obtain the output voltage swing for op-amp comparator.
Specification: R= 1kΩ; RL=10kΩ; VZ=6v; VSat=±15v (Assume forward bias of zener = 0.7v).
