8. Specification of op-amp 741c is given below:
A=200000; Ri=2MΩ; Ro=75Ω; Supply voltages= ±15v; output voltage swing =±13v; fo=5hz.
Compute the value of output resistance, bandwidth and closed loop voltage gain for the circuit shown.
a) ROF=8.6mΩ , fF= 53005hz and AF=-9.36
b)  ROF=4.12mΩ , fF= 53005hz and AF=-11.78
c) ROF=7.1mΩ , fF = 53005hz and AF=-16.95
d) ROF=1.9mΩ , fF= 53005hz  and AF=-10
c
=> ROF= ±75/(1+200000*0.053) = 53005hz.
Closed loop voltage gain, AF= -(A*K)/(1+AB), Where k= RF/(R1+F) = 6.2kΩ/(330Ω+6.2kΩ) = 0.949
=> AF = -(200000*0.949)/[1+(200000*0.0535)] = -16.95.
