1. For the given circuit find the output voltage?
a) -5.625v
b) -3.50v
c) -4.375v
d) -3.125v
d
So, the output voltage Vo=-RF [(b3/2R) +(b2/4R) +(b1/8R)+(b0/16R)]
From the circuit, b3=5v, b2=0v, b1=5v, bo=0v.
Vo= -20kΩ[(5/2×20kΩ)+0+(5/8×20kΩ)+0]= -3.125v. 
2. Which type of switches are not preferable for a simple weighted resistor DAC?
a) Bipolar Transistor
b) Voltage switches
c) MOSFET
d) All of the mentioned
a
3. The inverted R-2R ladder can also be operated in
a) Inverted mode
b) Current Mode
c) Voltage mode
d) Non inverted mode
b
4. Which of among the following circuit is considered to be linear?
a) Weighted Resistor type DAC
b) R-2R ladder type DAC
c) Inverter R-2R ladder DAC
d) All of the mentioned
c
5. Multiplying DAC uses

6. Calculate the value of LSB and MSB of a 12-bit DAC for 10v?
a) LSB =7.8mv, MSB =5v
b) LSB =9.3mv, MSB =5v
c) LSB =14.3mv, MSB =5v
d) LSB =2.4mv, MSB =5v
d
For 10v range, LSB =10v/4096=2.4mv and MSB = (1/2)×full scale =(1/2)×10v =5v. 
7. A multiplying DAC is given a reference voltage VR = Vom cos2πft. Determine the output voltage?
a) Vo(t) = Vom sin(2πft+180o)
b) Vo(t) = Vom cos(2πft+180o)
c) Vo(t) = Vom tan(2πft+180o)
d) Vo(t) = Vom sec(2πft+180o)
b
8. Multiplying digital to analog converters are used in
a)  All of the mentioned
b)  Digitally programmable filter
c)  Digitally programmable oscillator
d)  Digitally controlled audio attenuator
d
9. A 10-bit D/A converter have an output range from 0-9v. Calculate the output voltage produced when the input binary number is 1110001010.
a) ±7.96v
b) -7.96v
c) 7.96v
d) None of the mentioned
c
=9v×(0.5+0.25+0+0.125+7.8125×10-3+1.95 ×10-3) =9v×0.8547 =7.96v. 
10. The basic step of a 8-bit DAC is 12.4mv.If the binary input 00000000 represents 0v. Determine the output, if the input is 101101111?
a) 1.36v
b) 2.27v
c) 5.45v
d) None of the mentioned
b
=12.4mv × 183 = 2.27v.
