1. To obtain a faster slew rate the op-amp should have
a) High current and large compensating capacitor
b) Small compensating capacitor
c) High current or small compensating capacitor
d) Low current or large compensating capacitor
c
Therefore the higher current should be given a small compensating capacitor is used internally or outside an op-amp. 
2. Find the expression for full power response.
a) fmax(Hz) =(slew rate×106)/(6.28×Vm)
b) fmax(Hz) =slew rate /(628×106×Vm)
c) fmax(Hz) =(slew rate×Vm×106)/6.28
d) fmax(Hz) =(6.28×Vm× 106)/ slew rate
a
where fmax is called as full power response. 
3. Calculate the time taken by the output to swing from +14v to -14v for a 741C op-amp having a slew rate of 0.5V/µs?
a) 22µs
b) 42µs
c) 56µs
d) 70µs
c
=> Time taken = 14-(-14)/ 0.5V/µs = 28v/0.5V/µs = 56µs. 
4. Consider a square wave having a peak to peak amplitude of 275mv and it is amplified to a peak to peak amplitude of 4v, with rise time of 5.2µs. Calculate the slew rate?
a) 0.615 v/µs
b) 0.712 v/µs
c) 0.325 v/µs
d) None of the mentioned
a
△v= (90%-10%)×4v= (0.9-0.1)×4v =3.2v.
Therefore, slew rate = 3.2v/5.2µs =0.615v/µs. 
5. Determine the maximum input signal to be applied to an op-amp to get distortion free output. If the op-amp used is an inverting amplifier with a gain of 50 and maximum output amplitude obtained is 4.2V sine wave?
a) 159mv
b) 0.168mv
c) 207mv
d) 111mv
b
∴ the output voltage = 4.2+4.2 =8.4 V peak to peak.
Hence for the output to be undistorted sine wave, the maximum input signal should be less than => 8.4/50= 0.168 = 168mVpeak to peak. 
6. What happens if the frequency or amplitude of the input signal is increased to exceed slew rate of the op-amp?
a) All of the mentioned
b) High frequency output
c) Distorted output
d) Large amplitude output
c
7. Compute the peak output amplitude, when the voltage gain verses frequency curve of 741C is flat upto 25Hz.
a)  4Vpeak
b)  9Vpeak
c)  20Vpeak
d)  None of the mentioned
d
=> Vm = (SR×106)/(2πf )  = (0.5×106)/(2π×25kHz)
Vm = 3.18Vpeak. 
8. Calculate the maximum input frequency at which the output will be distorted from the given specifications
Vo = 30 Vpp ; Slew rate = 0.6v/µs.
a) 1000Hz
b) 10kHz
c) 1kHz
d) 10kHz
d
=> 30v/(0.6v/µs) =50µs. Hence the maximize input frequency fmax at which the output get distorted is fmax = 1/(2×50µs) =10000 =10kHz. 
9. Match AC parameter of the op-amp in column 1 with the column 2.
 Column 1
 Column-2
1. Bandwidth
	 i . a large signal phenomenon
2. Transient response 
 ii. Rise time is related to bandwidth and overshoots measure stability
3. Slew rate 
 iii. Depends on compensating components and closed loop gain 
a) 1-i 2-iii 3-ii
b) 1-ii	2-iii 3-i
c) 1-iii 2-ii 3-i
d) 1-iii 2-i 3-ii
c
