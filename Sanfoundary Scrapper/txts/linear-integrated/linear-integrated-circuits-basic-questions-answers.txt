1. The temperature of a thermistor increases, when the value of its resistance
a) Remain constant
b) Increase
c) Decrease
d) Depends on the heating material
c
2.
Consider the entire resistors in the bridge circuit are equal. The resistance and change in resistance are given as 3kΩ and 30kΩ. Calculate the output voltage of differential instrumentation amplifier?
a) 4.95v
b) 1.65v
c) 8.25v
d) 14.85v
b
= (5.5kΩ/100Ω)×(30kΩ/3kΩ)×3 = 1.65v. 
3. Consider a thermistor having the following specifications: RF=150kΩ at a reference temperature of 35oC and temperature coefficient of resistance = 25oC. Determine the change in resistance at 100oC.
a) -1.625MΩ
b) 9.75MΩ
c) 4.78MΩ
d) None of the mentioned
a
△R=-1.625MΩ. 
4. Consider the given bridge circuit, find the voltage across the output terminal, Vab.
a) Vab = 4.9v
b) Vab = -5.6v
c) Vab =1.2v
d) Vab =-8.2v
a
Va =( Ra×Vdc)/[Ra+(RT+△R)] = (1kΩ×5v)/(1kΩ+75kΩ) = 0.065v
Vb = ( Rb×Vdc)/(Rb+Rc) = (50kΩ×5v)/(50kΩ+250Ω) = 4.975v
The voltage across the output terminal of the bridge, Vab = Va– Vb = 4.9v. 
5. Express the equation for transducer bridge, if all the resistor values are equal
a) v=-(△R×Vdc)/(2×R+△R)
b) v=-(△R×Vdc)/2×(R+△R)
c) v=-Vdc/[2×(2×R+△R)].
d) v=-(△R×Vdc)/ [2×(2×R+△R)].
d

a) Photocells
b) Light dependent
c) Stain gage
d) None of the mentioned
c
