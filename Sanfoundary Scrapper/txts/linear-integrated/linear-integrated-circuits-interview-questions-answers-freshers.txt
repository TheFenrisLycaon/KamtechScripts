1. To increase the input resistance, the differential amplifier replaces transistor by

b) Current repeater
c) Darlington pair
d) All of the mentioned
c
2.  In Darlington pair differential amplifier the current gain is given as 100. Where IB1=5µA and IC1=0.35mA. Determine IC2
a) 0.5mA
b) 1.5mA
c) 2mA
d) 0.15mA
d
Substituting the values in the equation, we get
IC2=(β×IB1)-IC1 =(100×5µA)-0.35mA =0.15mA. 
3. In the circuit shown, find the overall current gain?
a) 456218
b) 444878
c) 444210
d) 455734
b
IE1= IB1+ IC1 = 1.43mA + 5.6µA = 1.435mA.
IE1= IB2 = 1.435mA.
The individual current gain values,
β1=IC1/ IB1
=> β1 = 1.43mA/5.6µA= 255.36.
Similarly,β2=IC2/ IB2
=> β2 = 2.5A / 1.435mA =1742.16
Therefore, the overall current gain, β = β1 × β2 = 255.36 × 1742.16 = 444878. 
4. Introducing FET differential amplifier pair at the input stage of differential amplifier produces
a) High output resistance

7. What is the equation of load current for a differential amplifier with an active load?
a) IL = gm×vd
b) IL = Iq /2

a) 0.156A
b) 1.56A
c) 0.156mA
d) 15.6µA
a
IL = gm×Vin1 + gm×Vin2
= gm×( Vin1 – Vin2) = 0.065 Ω-1×(4.9v-2.5v) = 0.156A. 
9. Calculate the VI – VO for the level shifter shown in the figure (Assume identical silicon transistor and very large value of β). Transistor QA and QB form current mirror.
a) 5.56V
b) 6.00v
c) 7.98v
d) 6.65v
d
=> I = (VCC – VBE) / R0 = (15v-0.7)/12k Ω (for β>>1, output current =input current)
=> I= 1.19mA.
The shift in level is given as VI – VO = VBE + I×R1 =0.07v+1.19mA×5kΩ =6.65v. 
10. Load resistors (Re) is neglected for maximizing the voltage gain in amplifier because,
a) Requires large chip are
b) Requires large power supply
c) Quiescent drop across Re increases
d) All of the mentioned
d

a
13. An output stage amplifier can produce output signal, when the input signal is
a) 0.48v
b) 0.9v
c) 1.2v
d) 0.5v
c
Since, VBE= 0.5v
=> 2×VBE= 1v. 
14. Find the disadvantage in the following circuit diagram:
a) Voltage get attenuated by R1
b) Voltage get attenuated by R2
c) Voltage get attenuated by R1 and R2
d) Voltage shift get increased by the drop across R1 and R2
b
=> R2/(R1 + R2).
