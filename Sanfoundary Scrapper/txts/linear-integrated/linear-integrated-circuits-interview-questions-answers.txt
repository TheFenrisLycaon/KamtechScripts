1. What is the frequency of oscillation of wein bridge oscillator?
a) fo = 1/(2πRC)
b) fo = 2π/RC
c) fo = RC/2π
d) fo = 2πRC
a
2. Sustained oscillation in wein bridge oscillator is possible when the value of ß is
a) 3
b) 1/3
c) 1
d) None of the mentioned
b
3. Determine the value of  fo, ß and Rf from the following circuit diagram.
a) fo = 80Hz, ß = 0.162 and Rf = 7kΩ
b) fo = 100Hz, ß = 1.62 and Rf = 7kΩ
c) fo = 60Hz, ß = 0.0162 and Rf = 7kΩ
d) fo = 120Hz, ß = 16.2 and Rf = 7kΩ
c
fo = 1/(2π×√(R1R2C1C2))
= 1/(2π×√(2.7kΩ×5kΩ×0.1µF×6µF) = 1/(2π×2.85×10-3)
=> fo = 55.8 = 60Hz.
The value of ß = (R2C1) / (R1C1 + R2C2 + R2C1)
= (5kΩ×0.1µF)/(2.7kΩ×0.1µF+5kΩ×6µF+5kΩ×0.1µF)= 0.0162.
Rf =2 R3
=> Rf = 2×3.5kΩ=7kΩ. 
4. What is the problem faced by the wein bridge oscillator?
a) Output sinewave get clipped
b) Output sinewave remain constant without growing
c) Output sinewave keep on decreasing and die out
d) All of the mentioned
a
5. Find the type of oscillator shown in the diagram
a) Quadrature oscillator
b) Biphasic oscillator
c) RC phase shit oscillator
d) None of the mentioned
d
6. Calculate the value of capacitance in wein bridge oscillator, such that fo =1755Hz and R=3.3kΩ.
a) 2.7µF
b) 0.91µF
c) 0.03µF
d) 0.05µF
c
=> C = 0.159/R×fo = 0.159/3.3kΩ×1755Hz
=> C = 0.027µF = 0.03µF. 
7. Quadrature oscillators have signals with

c) 159Hz
d) 318Hz
d
=> fo= 1/(2π×50kΩ×0.01µF)= 318Hz.
