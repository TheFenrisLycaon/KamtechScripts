1. Which type of amplifier has output voltage equal to the average of all input voltages?
a) Inverting averaging amplifier
b) Non-inverting averaging amplifier
c) Non-inverting summing amplifier
d) Inverting scaling amplifier
b
2. Expression for output voltage of non-inverting summing amplifier with five input voltage?
a)  Vo  = 5×( Va + Vb+ Vc+ Vd+ Ve)
b)  Vo  = [1+( Rf/R1)]× ( Va + Vb+ Vc+ Vd+ Ve)
c)  Vo = Va + Vb+ Vc+ Vd+ Ve
d)  Vo  = ( Va + Vb+ Vc+ Vd+ Ve) /5
c
Since there are five input voltages => (1+ ( Rf /  R1 )) =5
Therefore, Vo  = 5×( Va + Vb+ Vc+ Vd+ Ve) /5
=> Vo =  (Va + Vb+ Vc+ Vd+ Ve). 
3. Find the value of V1 in the circuit shown below?
a)  4v
b)  2v
c)  3v
d)  None of the mentioned
d
4. If the gain of a non-inverting averaging amplifier is one, determine the input voltages if the output voltage, if the output voltage is 3v?
a)  V1  =6v ,V2=3v and V3=2v
b)  V1  =9v ,V2=5v and V3=-4v
c)  V1  =8v ,V2=-6v and V3=1v
d)  V1  =7v ,V2=4v and V3=-3v
d
∴ sum of input voltage =3×3=9.
From the given option, the combination of input voltage 7v, 4v and -3v gives the value 9v. 
5. In the circuit shown, supply voltage = ±15v, Va= +3v , Vb= -4v , Vc= +5v, R= R1= 1kΩ and RF= 2kΩ.  741 op-amp has A=  2×105 and R1= 10kΩ. Determine the output voltage internal resistance of the circuit?
a)  Vo ≅3v , RiF=6.67MΩ
b)  Vo ≅3v , RiF= 7MΩ
c)  Vo ≅3v , RiF=9.2MΩ
d)  Vo ≅3v , RiF= 3.5MΩ
a
Internal resistance of circuit, RiF =R i [A×R1/ (R1+ RF)] = 100Ω×[(200000×1kΩ)/(1kΩ+2kΩ)]
=> RiF= 6.67 MΩ.

7. Calculate the output voltage, when a voltage of 12mv is applied to the non-inverting terminal and 7mv is applied to inverting terminal of a subtractor.
a) 19mv
b) 5mv
c) 1.7mv
d) 8.4mv
b
8. Find the differential amplifier configured as a subtractor from the given circuit.
d
