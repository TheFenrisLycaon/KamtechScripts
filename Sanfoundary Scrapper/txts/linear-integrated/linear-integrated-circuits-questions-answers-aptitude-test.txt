a) A/[1+ j(f/fo1)]x[1+ j(f/fo2)]x[1+ j(f/fo3)].
b) A/[1+ j(f/fo)]3
c) A/A/[1+ j(f/fo1)]+ [1+ j(f/fo2)]+ [1+ j(f/fo3)].
d)  All of the mentioned
c
7. Find out the frequencies that are avoided in frequency response plot?
a) None of the mentioned
b) Single break frequency
c) Upper break frequency
d) Lower break frequency

8. In a phase response curve of MC1556, the phase shift is -162.5o about 4MHz. If the approximate value of first break frequency is 5.5Hz. Determine the approximate value of the second break frequency?
a) 945.89MHz
b) 945.89kHz
c) 945.89GHz
d) 945.89Hz
b
=>  -162.5o = – tan-1(3MHz/5.5) –  tan-1(3MHz/fo2)
=>  tan-1(3MHz/fo2) = +162.5o-89.99o
=> 3MHz/fo2= tan(72.50o)
=> fo2 = 3MHz/tan(72.50o)=945.89kHz. 
9. Consider a practical op-amp having two break frequency due to a number of RC pole pairs. Determine the gain equation using the given specifications:
A ≅ 102.92dB; fo1 =6Hz ; fo2 =2.34MHz .
a) 140000/[1+ j(f/6)]x[1+ j(f/2.34)].
b) 140000/[1+ j(f/6)]x[1+ j(f/234)].
c) 140000/[1+ j(f/6)]x[1+ j(f/23400)].
d) 140000/[1+ j(f/6)]x[1+ j(f/2340000)].
d
=> A = 105.146 =139958.73 ≅ 140000.
The gain equation with two break frequency value is given as
 AOL(f) = A/[1+ j(f/fo1)]x[1+ j(f/fo2)] =140000/[1+ j(f/6)]x[1+ j(f/2.34)].

a) 106
b) 108
c) 10-5
d) 10-10
a
=> =fo×A = 0.2×106 × 5  = 106.
