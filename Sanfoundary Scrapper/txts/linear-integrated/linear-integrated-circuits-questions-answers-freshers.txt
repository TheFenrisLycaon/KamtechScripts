a) 9.8v
b) 5.6v
c) 7.8v
d) 10v
d
⇒ VA = Ro×Iref =2.5×2kΩ×2mA =10v.

b) 13/(1+1/β)Ω
c) 14/(1+1/β)Ω
d) 1.36/(1+1/β)Ω
c
⇒ RE= 0.025/(1+1/β)10mA × ln(12.7A/10mA) = 14/(1+1/β)Ω.

6. If the reference and collector current are 0.539mA and 0.49mA respectively, how many transistors are used in current repeater circuit? (Assume β =150)
a) 11
b) 14
c) 10
d) 8
b
⇒ 0.49mA= 0.539mA×150/(150+1+N)
⇒ N=14.
7. For the current repeater shown in the circuit, determine IC4 value, Where β = 75.
a) 0.035mA
b) 0.028mA
c) 0.04mA
d) 0.052mA
a
⇒ Iref=IC+4×IB
                  =IC(1+1/β)
∴ IC= Iref×(1+1/β)
               =Iref×(1+1/β) = 0.366mA×(1+1/75) =0.347mA
⇒ IC1=IC2=IC3=0.347mA
To determine IC4,
RE=VT/(1+1/β)×IC4×ln(C3/IC4)
⇒ 1.62kΩ =  25mv/(1+1/75)×IC4×ln(0.347mA/IC4)
⇒ IC4=0.035mA (find using trial and error method).
