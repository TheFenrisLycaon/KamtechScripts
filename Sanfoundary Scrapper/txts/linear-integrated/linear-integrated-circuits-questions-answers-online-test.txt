1. How are input offset voltage of op-amp expressed
a) Microvolts per week
b) Nanovolts per week
c) Megavolts per week
d) Millivolts per week
a
2. Find the expression for output offset voltage?
a) VooT = [RF/R1×Vio] + (RF×Io)
b) VooT = [1+(RF/R1)]×(Vio) + (RF×Io)
c) VooT = [1+(RF/R1)]/(Vio) + (RF×Io)
d) VooT = [RF/R1]×(Vio) + (RF/Io)
b
 VooT = [1+(RF/R1)]×(Vio) + (RF×Io). 
3. Why it is necessary to calibrate all op-amp in the system periodically?
a) To maintain current drift of a system
b) To maintain output offset voltage in op-amp
c) To maintain accuracy and linearity of a system
d) None of the mentioned
c
4. Determine the maximum possible change in output offset voltage after 3 month if the LH0041C op-amp is initially nulled and room temperature, voltage across terminal, +Vcc & -Vee remain constant.
a) △VooT = 456.78mv
b) △VooT = 3.452mv
c) △VooT = 21.1mv
d) None of the mentioned
d
△Vio/△t = 5µV/week and △Iio /△t = 2nA/week.
Due to the time drift △t=12 weeks (3months). The maximum possible change in output offset voltage,
△VooT = [[1+(RF/R1)]×(△Vio/△t)×△t]+[RF×(△Iio/△t) ×△t]= [(1+(250kΩ/1kΩ))×5µV×12] + [250kΩ×2µA×12] = 15.1mv+6mv
=> △VooT = 21.1mv.
