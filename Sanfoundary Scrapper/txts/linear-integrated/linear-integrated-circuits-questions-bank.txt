a) Differential Amplifier with one op-amp
b) Differential Amplifier with two op-amp
c)  Differential Amplifier with three op-amp
d) None of the mentioned
b
2. How is it possible to vary the voltage from closed loop gain to the open loop gain?
a) By using differential amplifier with larger gain
b) By using differential amplifier with small gain
c) By using differential amplifier with variable gain
d) By using differential amplifier with differential gain
c
3.  A differential amplifier with two op-amps has the following specifications:
R1=R3=1.5kΩ ; RF=R2=5.7kΩ.  Compute the input resistance for the following circuit.
a) RIFx = 83GΩ, RIFy = 317GΩ
b) RIFx = 90GΩ, RIFy = 400GΩ
c) RIFx = 59GΩ, RIFy = 269GΩ
d) RIFx = 36GΩ, RIFy = 156GΩ
a
=> RIFy = Ri*[1+(A *R2)/( R2+ R3)]
= RIFy  = 2MΩ*[(1+200000*5.7kΩ)/(5.7kΩ+1.5kΩ)] = 3.166*1011 = 317GΩ.
Similarly the input resistance of the second stage amplifier is given as RIFx,
=> RIFx = Ri*[1+(A *R1)/( R1+ RF)]
= RIFx  = 2MΩ*[(1+200000*1.5kΩ)/(5.7kΩ+1.5kΩ)] = 83GΩ.
4. Determine the output voltage from the diagram. Where V1=-4.3Vpp and V2 = -5.1Vpp sinewave at 1000hz.
a) 12  Vpp sinewave at 1000hz
b) 13.3 Vpp sinewave at 1000hz
c) 14 Vpp sinewave at 1000hz
d) 11 Vpp sinewave at 1000hz
b
Output voltage , Vo = AD(V1– V2) = 16.62(-4.3Vpp+5.1Vpp) = 13.29 =13.3 Vpp sinewave at 1000hz.

5. Determine the output resistance of differential amplifier with three op-amp. The op-amp used is  741c, with A=200000 and Ro. The output and difference of input voltages are 44 and 11.
a) 5.5mΩ
b) 3.5mΩ
c) 2.4mΩ
d) 1.5mΩ
d
The output resistance of differential amplifier is given as ROF=Ro/[1+(A/AD)]= 75/[1+(200000/4)] = 1.5mΩ.
6. Find the input resistance for the given circuit
a) RIF = Ri*[1+(A*R4+R5)/(2* R4+R5)].
b) RIF = Ri*[1+(A*R4)/(2* R4+R5)].
c) RIF = Ri*[1+(A*R4+R5)/(R4+R5)].
d) None of the mentioned
a
From the diagram, B=Vf/Vo = [R4+R5)/(2* R4+R5)].
Therefore, RIF = Ri*[1+(A*R4+R5)/(2* R4+R5)].
7. The bandwidth of the differential amplifier increases, if the value of
a) Open loop voltage gain decreases
b) Closed loop voltage gain decreases
c) Differential voltage gain decreases
d) All of the mentioned
b
8. Calculate the bandwidth for the given circuit.(Where the 741 op-amp has gain of 200000).
a) 560hz
b) 390khz
c) 25.6khz
d) 1.5Mhz
c
=> AD = -5*7.8=-39.
The bandwidth for the circuit is calculated as fF = (A*fo)/AD = (200000*5hz)/39 (For 741 op-amp 5hz is the break frequency)
=> fF = 25.6khz.
9. Calculate the output voltage. If Vx=3.9Vpp and Vy = 5.5 Vpp sinewave at 1khz for the following circuit.
a) 11 Vpp sinewave at 1Khz
b) -8Vpp Vpp sinewave at 1Khz
c) -10 Vpp sinewave at 1Khz
d) 6 Vpp sinewave at 1Khz
b
The output voltage, Vo = – AD*(V x– V y) = 5*(3.9-5.5) = -8 Vpp sinewvae at 1Khz.
