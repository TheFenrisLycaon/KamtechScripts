Figure 1
Two plates are joined by double strap butt joints with rivets arrangement as shown in the figure. Width of the plate is 300mm and diameter of rivets 30mm. The thickness of the plates can be taken as 20mm.Allowable stress in tension, shear and compression are 80 N/mm²,60 N/mm² and 160N/mm².
Answer the following questions with respect to figure 1
1. Calculate the shear resistance of 1 rivet along A-A.
a) 21.2kN
b) 42.4kN
c) 84.8kN
d) None of the listed
c
2. Calculate the tensile strength of rivet along A-A.
a) 2592kN
b) 864kN
c) 216kN
d) 432kN
d
3. Calculate the tensile strength of rivets along B-B.
a) 84.8kN
b) 468.8kN
c) 384kN
d) None of the listed
b
4. Calculate the tensile strength of rivets along C-C.
a) 772kN
b) None of the listed
c) 336kN
d) 590.4kN
d
5. Calculate efficiency of the joint.
a) 45%
b) 85%
c) 90%
d) 100%
c
Explanatio: Strength along A-A, B-B and C-C are 432kN, 468.8kN and 590.4kN and strength of solid plate=wσt=480kN.  Lowes is along AA. Hence efficiency=432/480. 
6. Calculate the crushing resistance of 1 rivet.
a) 1153kN
b) 108kN
c) 96kN
d) 576kN
c
7. Calculate the pitch of the rivets.
a) None of the listed
b) 210mm
c) 105mm
d) 52.5mm
c
8. The type of arrangement shown is
a) Lozenge Joint
b) Lap Joint
c) Star Joint
d) Darwin’s Joint
a
9. If circumferential stress is P, then longitudinal stress in the pressure vessel is?
a) 2P
b) P/2
c) P
d) None of the listed
b
10. If width of plate=80mm ad diameter of rivets 10mm, then pitch will be?
a) 65mm
b) 60mm
c) 50mm
d) 70mm
c
