Answer the questions 1-7 with respect to this figure
1. The bearing characteristic number shown in the graph is directly proportional to the unit bearing pressure.
a) True
b) False
b
2. In the graph shown, which regions points the partial metal to metal contact.
a) BC
b) CD
c) Both BC and CD
d) Can’t be determined
a
Explanatiion: BC is the condition of thin film and hence surfaces are not completely separated. 
3. Hydrodynamic lubrication takes place in region?
a) BC
b) CD
c) Both BC and CD
d) None of the mentioned
b
4. Coefficient of friction is minimum at
a) It is same at each point
b) B
c) C
d) D
c
5. Bearing modulus is the bearing characteristic number at
a) B
b) C
c) D
d) None of the listed
b
6. If viscosity of the lubricant is very low than BCN will lie in the region
a) BC
b) Point C
c) CD
d) Can’t be determined
a
7.  The fundamental equation for viscous flow is given by ∆pbhᵌ/6µl where symbols have their usual meanings.
a) 6 is to be replaced by 3
b) 6 is to be replaced by 12
c) 6 is to be replaced by 9
d) 6 is to be replaced by 15
b
8. A single transverse weld is preferred over double transverse fillet weld.
 a) True
b) False
b
9. Transverse fillet weld can be designed using the same equations as of parallel fillet weld.
a) True
b) False
b
