1. The system in which variation in size is accepted is termed as ___________
a) Limit system
b) Tolerance System
c) Limit and tolerance system
d) Variable system
a
2. What is the basic size?
a) Size calculated by the design engineer to withstand the stress coming in component
b) Size exactly of that of given object under consideration
c) Size of the object with given deviations
d) Size with which a job come out of the shop
a
3. What is the actual size?
a) Dimension of a component on paper
b) Dimension of the component manufactured
c) Size of the component as per theory of failure
d) Size of the object with all the tolerances
b
4. Tolerance is ___________
a) Difference between the basic size and maximum limit
b) Difference Between the minimum and basic size
c) Difference between the maximum and minimum limit size
d) The maximum size of the component allowed
c
5. Cost of manufacturing is ____________
a) Inversely proportional to the amount of tolerance specified
b) Directly proportional to the amount of tolerance specified
c) Does not depends on tolerance specified
d) Does depends non-linearly
a
6. A component is given the dimension as shown below. The type of tolerance is __________
a) Symmetrical
b) Unilateral
c) Unequal bilateral
d) Equal bilateral
c
7. For the below given figure, the dimension of A will be __________
a) 40.20
b) 40.60
c) 40.00
d) 39.7
c
Minimum dimension of A=120 – (40+.2) – (40+0) = 39.8
Maximum dimension of A= (120+.6) – (40 – .2) – (40 – .3) = 40.1
So only 40.00 lie in between 39.8 and 40.1. 
8. What is the minimum dimension of the given shaft up to which it can be machined?
a) 35.79
b) 35.49
c) 35.99
d) 35.29
b
Here, Minimum size = Basic size -lower tolerance
                           =35.79 – 0.3 = 35.49.
9. What is the type of the tolerance provided here and dimension of the given object in the figure below?
a) Equal bilateral and maximum size of 50.05
b) Equal bilateral and minimum size of 50.05
c) Equal bilateral and minimum size of 49.95, maximum size of 50.05
d) Equal unilateral and minimum size of 49.05, maximum size of 50.05
c
10. The type of the dimension of the given object in the below figure is __________
a) Basic size equal to 50.00 and tolerance +.05 and -.05
b) Limits where maximum limit is 50.05 and minimum limit is 49.05
c) Basic size with the tolerance
d) Dimension of rectangle having 50.05 and 49.98
b
