v2 = 2V – u2
v2 = 3.5 m/s
10. A sphere of mass 25 Kg is moving at a speed of 1.5 m/s undergoes collision with another sphere of mass 50 Kg moving at 3m/s in the same direction, find the velocity of 25 Kg mass in m/s after collision when the collision is inelastic with e = 0.6.
a) 2.5
b) 2.00
c) 3.5
d) 3.1
d
m1u1 + m2u2/(m1+ m2) = v
substituting the values we get
V = 2.5 m/s
v2 = 2(1+e)V – eu2
v2 = 3.1 m/s.
11. A sphere of mass 25 Kg is moving at a speed of 1.5 m/s undergoes collision with another sphere of mass 50 Kg moving at 3m/s in the same direction, find the velocity of 50 Kg mass in m/s after collision when the collision is inelastic with e = 0.6.
