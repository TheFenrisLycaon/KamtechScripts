a) p cosα
b) p secα
c) p tanα
d) p cotα
d
             b > p cotα.
3. Match the type of gears with their most appropriate description.
 Type of gear                                 Description
P. Helical                                   1. Axes non parallel and intersecting
Q. Spiral                                    2. Axes parallel and teeth are inclined to the axis
R. Hypoid 				     3. Axes parallel and teeth are parallel to the axis
S. Rack and pinion                           4. Axes are perpendicular and intersecting,and teeth are inclined to the axis
                                             5. Axes are perpendicular and used for large speed reduction
                                             6. Axes parallel and one of the gears has infinite radius
a) P-2, Q- 4, R- 1, S- 6
b) P-1, Q- 4, R- 5, S- 6
c) P-2, Q- 6, R- 4, S- 2
d) P-6, Q- 3, R- 1, S- 5
a
Spiral  – Axes are perpendicular and intersecting,and teeth are inclined to the axis
Hypoid – Axes non parallel and intersecting
Rack and pinion  – Axes parallel and one of the gears has infinite radius.
4. Tooth interference in an external in volute spur gear pair can be reduced by
a) Decreasing center distance between gear pair
b) Decreasing module
c) Decreasing pressure angle
d) Increasing number of gear teeth
d
 i. Increase number of gear teeth
 ii. Modified involutes
 iii. Modified addendum
 iv. Increased centre distance .
5. Interference in a pair of gears is avoided, if the addendum circles of both the gears intersect common tangent to the base circles within the points of tangency.
a) True
b) False
a
6. Twenty degree full depth involute profiled 19-tooth pinion and 37-tooth gear are in mesh. If the module is 5 mm, the centre distance between the gear pair will be
a) 140 mm
b) 150 mm
c) 280 mm
d) 300 mm
a
                           = 140 mm.
7. If the drive efficiency is 80%, then torque required on the input shaft to create 1000 N output thrust is
a) 20 Nm
b) 25 Nm
c) 32 Nm
d) 50 Nm
b
D/T = 2
∴ D = 80 × 2 = 160 mm
 2F = 1000, or F = 500 N
Let T1 be the torque applied by motor.
TT2 be the torque applied by gear.
∴ Power transmission = 80%
Now, T1ω12 x ω2/0.8
T1 = 25 N-m.
8. If the pressure angle of the rack is 20°, then force acting along the line of action between the rack and the gear teeth is
a) 250 N
b) 342 N
c) 532 N
d) 600 N
c
∴ Force acting along the line of action,
P = F/cos φ
  = 500/cos20°
  = 532 N.
9. Two mating spur gears have 40 and 120 teeth respectively. The pinion rotates at 1200 rpm and transmits a torque of 20 Nm. The torque transmitted by the gear is
a) 6.6 Nm
b) 20 Nm
c) 40 Nm
d) 60Nm
d
N1 = speed of pinion
N2 = speed of gear wheel
T1 = number of teeth of gear
T2 = number of teeth of pinion
1200/N2 = 120/40
N2 = 400 r.p.m.
Since power transmitted by both gear will be equal
T1ω12 x ω2
torque transmitted by gear, = 60 N-m.
10. The velocity ratio between pinion and gear in a gear drive is 2.3, the module of teeth is 2.0 mm and sum of number of teeth on pinion and gear is 99. What is the centre distance between pinion and the gear?
a) 49.5 mm
b) 99 mm
c) 148.5 mm
d) 198 mm
b
                             = m/2(T1 + T2)
                             = 2/2 x 99 = 99 mm.
