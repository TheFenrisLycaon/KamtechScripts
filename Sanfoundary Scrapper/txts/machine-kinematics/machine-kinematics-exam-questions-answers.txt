b) Brake
c) Final drive
d) Differential
d
2. Two wheelers are also equipped with a differential.
a) True
b) False
b
3. Which of the following device allows the wheels of a car to rotate at two different speeds?
a) Clutch
b) Brake
c) Final drive
d) Differential
d
4. Which of the following is true regarding a differential?
a) The outer wheel rotates at a higher speed than the inner wheel

6. On a straight road motion, what is the purpose served by differential?
a) Equal torque to all the wheels
b) More torque to front wheels
c) More torque to rear wheels
d) More torque to opposite wheels
a
7. Input torque acts on which of the following member?
a) Driven member
b) Driving member
c) Fixed member
d) Reciprocating member
b
8. Resisting torque acts on which of the following member?
a) Driven member
b) Driving member
c) Fixed member
d) Reciprocating member
a
9. Braking torque acts on which of the following member?
a) Driven member
b) Driving member
c) Fixed member
d) Reciprocating member
c
10. If the input power is increased to two times, what will be the effect of it on the fixed member power?
a) Has a 0 value
b) Increases by two times
c) Increases by 4 times
d) Decreases by two times
a
11. If the ratio of angular velocities of the driven and driving torque is one, find the Braking torque
a) 0
b) 2
c) 4
d) 8
a
T2 = -T1ω1/ω2
since the velocity ratio is 1
we have T2 + T1 = 0
now
T3 =  T2 + T1
Therefore, T3 = 0.
12. The angular speed of the driven member is twice the driving member, if the input torque is 100 N-m,
Find the load torque magnitude in N-m.
a) 50
b) 100
c) 200
d) 25
a
T2 = -T1ω1/ω2
since the velocity ratio is 1⁄2
we have T2 = 50 N-m.
13. Fixing torque’s value is independent of the load torque.
a) True
b) False
b
T3 = -(T2 + T1)
therefore its value is dependent on the load torque.
14. Load torque is directly proportional to the input angular velocity.
a) True
b) False
a
T2 = -T1ω1/ω2 where ω1 is the input angular velocity. Hence the given statement is correct.
