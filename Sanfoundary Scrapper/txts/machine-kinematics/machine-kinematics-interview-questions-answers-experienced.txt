1. The relation between the number of links (l) and the number of binary joints ( j) for a kinematic chain having constrained motion is given by j = 3/2 I -2 If the left hand side of this equation is greater than right hand side, then the chain is
a) locked chain
b) completely constrained chain
c) successfully constrained chain
d) incompletely constrained chain
a
2. In a kinematic chain, a quaternary joint is equivalent to
a) one binary joint
b) two binary joints
c) three binary joints
d) four binary joints
c
3. If n links are connected at the same joint, the joint is equivalent to
a) (n – 1) binary joints
b) (n – 2) binary joints
c) (2n – 1) binary joints
d) none of the mentioned
a
4. In a 4 – bar linkage, if the lengths of shortest, longest and the other two links are denoted by s, l, p and q, then it would result in Grashof’s linkage provided that
a) l + p < s + q
b) l + s < p + q
c) l + p = s + q
d) none of the mentioned
b

5. A kinematic chain is known as a mechanism when
a) none of the links is fixed
b) one of the links is fixed
c) two of the links are fixed
d) all of the links are fixed
b
6. The Grubler’s criterion for determining the degrees of freedom (n) of a mechanism having plane motion is
a) n = (l – 1) – j
b) n = 2 (l – 1) – 2j
c) n = 3 (l – 1) – 2j
d) n = 4 (l – 1) – 3j
c
i.e. n = 3 (l – 1) – 2j
where l = Number of links, and j = Number of binary joints.
7. The mechanism forms a structure, when the number of degrees of freedom (n) is equal to
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) – 1
a
                   When n = 1, then the mechanism can be driven by a single input motion.
                   When n = 2, then two separate input motions are necessary to produce constrained motion for the mechanism.
                    When n = – 1 or less, then there are redundant constraints in the chain and it forms a statically indeterminate structure.
8. In a four bar chain or quadric cycle chain
a) each of the four pairs is a turning pair
b) one is a turning pair and three are sliding pairs
c) three are turning pairs and one is sliding pair
d) each of the four pairs is a sliding pair.
a
9. Which of the following is an inversion of single slider crank chain ?
a) Beam engine
b) Watt’s indicator mechanism
c) Elliptical trammels
d) Whitworth quick return motion mechanism
d
10. Which of the following is an inversion of double slider crank chain ?
a) Coupling rod of a locomotive
b) Pendulum pump
c) Elliptical trammels
d) Oscillating cylinder engine
c
