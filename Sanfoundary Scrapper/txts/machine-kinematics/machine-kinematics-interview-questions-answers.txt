1. The unit of linear acceleration is
a) kg-m
b) m/s
c) m/s2
d) rad/s2
c
  unit of dv = m/s
  and dt     = s
therefore, dv/dt = m/s2 
2. The angular velocity (in rad/s) of a body rotating at N r.p.m. is
a) π N/60
b) 2 π N/60
c) π N/120
d) π N/180
b
ω =dθ/dt
3. The linear velocity of a body rotating at ω rad/s along a circular path of radius r is given by
a) ω.r
b) ω/r
c) ω2.r
d) ω2/r
a
4. When a particle moves along a straight path, then the particle has
a) tangential acceleration only
b) centripetal acceleration only
c) both tangential and centripetal acceleration
d) none of the mentioned
a
5. When a particle moves with a uniform velocity along a circular path, then the particle has
a) tangential acceleration only
b) centripetal acceleration only
c) both tangential and centripetal acceleration
d) none of the mentioned
b
6. When the motion of a body is confined to only one plane, the motion is said to be
a) translatory motion
b) plane motion
c) culvilinear motion
d) none of the mentioned
b
7. When the motion of a body is along a straight line path, it is called
a) translatory motion
b) plane motion
c) culvilinear motion
d) none of the mentioned
b
8. When the motion of a body is along a curved path, it is called
a) translatory motion
b) plane motion
c) culvilinear motion
d) none of the mentioned
b
