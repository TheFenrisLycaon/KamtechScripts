4. In a slider crank mechanism, the crank rotates with a constant angular velocity of 300 rpm, Length of crank is 150mm, and the length of the connecting rod is 600mm. Determine linear velocity of the midpoint of the connecting rod in m/s. Crank angle = 45° from IDC.
a) 4.1
b) 4.4
c) 4.8
d) 5.2
a
velocity of x = ωxL(crank)
= 4.713 m/s
We draw a corresponding velocity diagram for the same,
where this velocity is perpendicular to the crank, this diagram when drawn to scale turns out to be a triangle.
From the reference point we can measure the velocity of midpoint of connecting rod
V = 4.1 m/s.
5. In a slider crank mechanism, the crank rotates with a constant angular velocity of 300 rpm, Length of crank is 150mm, and the length of the connecting rod is 600mm. Determine acceleration of the midpoint of the connecting rod in m/s2. Crank angle = 45° from IDC.
a) 117
b) 144
c) 148
d) 252
a
velocity of x = ωxL(crank)
= 4.713 m/s
We draw a corresponding velocity diagram for the same,
where this velocity is perpendicular to the crank, this diagram when drawn to scale turns out to be a triangle.
From the reference point we can measure the velocity of midpoint of connecting rod V = 4.1 m/s
From the acceleration diagram of the same , we find that acceleration of midpoint of the connecting rod comes out to be
117m/s2.
6. What will be the shape of the velocity diagram of the slider crank mechanism if there are three links including the slider.
