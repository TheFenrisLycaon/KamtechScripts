pair of teeth in contact for continuous action.
9. In a simple train of wheels, if the number of intermediate wheels is odd, the motion of the follower will be same as that of the driver.
a) True
b) False
a
the speed of the driven or follower. But if the number of intermediate gears are even, the motion of the driven or follower will be in the opposite direction of the driver.
10. In a simple train of wheels, the velocity ratio _____________ the intermediate wheels.
a) depends upon
b) is independent of
c) is equal to
d) none of the mentioned
b
the speed of the driven or follower and ratio of speeds of any pair of gears in mesh is the inverse of
their number of teeth.
11. The train value of a gear train is
a) equal to velocity ratio of a gear train
b) reciprocal of velocity ratio of a gear train

a) simple train of wheels
b) compound train of wheels
c) reverted gear train

When there are more than one gear on a shaft, it is called a compound train of gear.
When the axes of the first gear (i.e. first driver) and the last gear (i.e. last driven or follower) are co-axial, then the gear train is known as reverted gear train.
