1. A wheel accelerates uniformly from rest to 2000 r.p.m. in 20 seconds. What is its angular acceleration?
a) 10.475 rad/s2
b) 12 rad/s2
c) 14 rad/s2
d) 15 rad/s2
a
Angular acceleration
Let α = Angular acceleration in rad/s2
We know that
ω = ω0 + α.t
or 209.5 = 0 + α × 20
or α = 209.5 / 20 = 10.475 rad/s2
2. A wheel accelerates uniformly from rest to 2000 r.p.m. in 20 seconds. How many revolutions does the wheel make in attaining the speed of 2000 r.p.m.?
a) 400
b) 300
c) 333.4
d) 200
c
We know that the angular distance moved by the wheel during 2000 r.p.m. (i.e. when ω = 209.5 rad/s),
θ = (ω0 + ω )t/2
  = (0 + 209.5)20/2
  = 2095 rad
Since the angular distance moved by the wheel during one revolution is 2π radians, therefore number of revolutions made by the wheel,
n = θ /2π = 2095/2π = 333.4

d) none of the mentioned
a
The acceleration of a particle at any instant moving along a circular path in a direction normal to the tangent at that instant and directed towards the centre of the circular path, is known as normal component.

7. A horizontal bar 1.5 metres long and of small cross-section rotates about vertical axis through one end. It accelerates uniformly from 1200 r.p.m. to 1500 r.p.m. in an interval of 5 seconds. What is the linear velocity at the beginning of the interval ?
a) 188.6 m/s
b) 235.5 m/s
c) 300 m/s
d) 400 m/s
a
N = 1500 r.p.m. or ω = 2 π × 1500/60 = 157 rad/s ; t = 5 s
Linear velocity at the beginning
We know that linear velocity at the beginning,
v0 = r . ω0 = 1.5 × 125.7 = 188.6 m/s

Linear velocity at the end of 5 seconds
We also know that linear velocity after 5 seconds,
v5 = r . ω = 1.5 × 157 = 235.5 m/s
