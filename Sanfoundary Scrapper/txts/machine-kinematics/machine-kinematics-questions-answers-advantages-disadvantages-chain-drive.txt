1. The advantages of the V-belt drive over flat belt drive are
a) The V-belt drive gives compactness due to the small distance between the centres of pulleys.
b) The drive is positive, because the slip between the belt and the pulley groove is negligible.
c) Since the V-belts are made endless and there is no joint trouble, therefore the drive is smooth.
d) all of the mentioned

a) The V-belt drive gives compactness due to the small distance between the centres of pulleys.
b) The drive is positive, because the slip between the belt and the pulley groove is negligible.
c) Since the V-belts are made endless and there is no joint trouble, therefore the drive is smooth.
d) It provides longer life, 3 to 5 years.
e) It can be easily installed and removed.
f) The operation of the belt and pulley is quiet.
g) The belts have the ability to cushion the shock when machines are started.
h) The high velocity ratio (maximum 10) may be obtained.
i) The wedging action of the belt in the groove gives high value of limiting ratio of tensions.
2. The disadvantages of the V-belt drive over flat belt drive are
a) The V-belt drive cannot be used with large centre distances.
b) The V-belts are not so durable as flat belts.
c) The construction of pulleys for V-belts is more complicated than pulleys for flat belts.
d) all of the mentioned
d
a) The V-belt drive cannot be used with large centre distances.
b) The V-belts are not so durable as flat belts.
c) The construction of pulleys for V-belts is more complicated than pulleys for flat belts.
d) Since the V-belts are subjected to certain amount of creep, therefore these are not suitable for constant speed application such as synchronous machines, and timing devices.
e) The belt life is greatly influenced with temperature changes, improper belt tension and mismatching of belt lengths.
f) The centrifugal tension prevents the use of V-belts at speeds below 5 m/s and above 50m/s.
