1. The velocity ratio of two pulleys connected by an open belt or crossed belt is
a) directly proportional to their diameters
b) inversely proportional to their diameters
c) directly proportional to the square of their diameters
d) inversely proportional to the square of their diameters
b
                   Let d1 = Diameter of the driver,
                         d2 = Diameter of the follower,
                         N1 = Speed of the driver in r.p.m., and
                         N2 = Speed of the follower in r.p.m.
∴ Length of the belt that passes over the driver, in one minute
                                        = π d1.N1
Similarly, length of the belt that passes over the follower, in one minute
                                        = π d2 . N2
Since the length of belt that passes over the driver in one minute is equal to the length of belt that passes over the follower in one minute, therefore
π d1.N1 = π d2 . N2
∴ Velocity ratio,     N2/N1 = d1/d2.
2. Two pulleys of diameters d1 and d2 and at distance x apart are connected by means of an open belt drive. The length of the belt is
a) π /2 (d1 + d2) 2x + (d1 + d2)2/4x
b) π /2 (d1 – d2) 2x + (d1 – d2)2/4x
c) π /2 (d1 + d2) 2x + (d1 – d2)2/4x
d) π /2 (d1 – d2) 2x + (d1 + d2)2/4x
c
3. In a cone pulley, if the sum of radii of the pulleys on the driving and driven shafts is constant, then
a) open belt drive is recommended
b) cross belt drive is recommended
c) both open belt drive and cross belt drive are recommended
d) the drive is recommended depending upon the torque transmitted
b
4. Due to slip of the belt, the velocity ratio of the belt drive
a) decreases
b) increases
c) does not change
d) none of the mentioned
a
5. When two pulleys of different diameters are connected by means of an open belt drive, then the angle of contact taken into consideration should be of the
a) larger pulley
b) smaller pulley
c) average of two pulleys
d) none of the mentioned
b

6. The power transmitted by a belt is maximum when the maximum tension in the belt (T) is equal to
a) TC
b) 2TC
c) 3TC
d) 4TC
c
                                   T = 3TC
where TC = Centrifugal tension.
7. The velocity of the belt for maximum power is
a) √T/3m
b) √T/4m
c) √T/5m
d) √T/6m
a
                                         T1 = T – T/3 = 2T/3
the velocity of the belt for the maximum power, v = √T/3m
where m = Mass of the belt in kg per metre length.
8. The centrifugal tension in belts
a) increases power transmitted
b) decreases power transmitted
c) have no effect on the power transmitted
d) increases power transmitted upto a certain speed and then decreases
c
9. When the belt is stationary, it is subjected to some tension, known as initial tension. The value of this tension is equal to the
a) tension in the tight side of the belt
b) tension in the slack side of the belt
c) sum of the tensions in the tight side and slack side of the belt
d) average tension of the tight side and slack side of the belt
d
10. The relation between the pitch of the chain ( p) and pitch circle diameter of the sprocket (d) is given by
a) p = d sin (600/T)
b) p = d sin (900/T)
c) p = d sin (1200/T)
d) p = d sin (1800/T)
