1. Which of the following apparatus is used to find the moment of inertia of an object?
a) Simple pendulum
b) Bifilar suspension
c) Compound pendulum
d) Spring pendulum
b
2. The strings used in bifilar suspension are perpendicular.
a) True
b) False
b
3. From the following data calculate the radius of gyration of the connecting rod.
mass of connecting rod = 1.5 Kg, length of wires = 1.25m, distance of wires to the rods = 0.12m
Time for 20 oscillations = 40 secs.
a) 107 mm
b) 110 mm
c) 95 mm
d) 100 mm
a
T = 40/20 = 2 sec, f = 0.5sec
Substituting the values into the bifilar expression we get
Kg = 107 mm. 
4. From the following data calculate the mass moment of inertia of the connecting rod in Kg-m2.
mass of connecting rod = 1.5 Kg, length of wires = 1.25m, distance of wires to the rods = 0.12m, Time for 20 oscillations = 40 secs.
a) 0.107
b) 0.017
c) 0.095
d) 0.010
b
T = 40/20 = 2 sec, f = 0.5sec
Substituting the values into the bifilar expression we get
k = 107 mm = 0.107m
I = mk2 = 0.017 Kg-m2. 
5. A rigid body has a radius of gyration of 20cm, if its moment of inertia is 10 Kg-m2, find its mass in kilograms.
a) 250
b) 225
c) 500
d) 125
a
Now I = 10 Kg-m2 and k = 0.2m
therefore m = I/k2
= 10/0.04
6. In a bifilar suspension, if the length of the connecting rod is decreased, which of the following quantities will increase?
a) Time period
b) Frequency
c) Radius of gyration
d) Acceleration
b
7. When the body is twisted through a small angle θ about a vertical axis through the centre of gravity, which of the following motion will occur?
a) Angular Simple Harmonic Motion
b) Linear Simple Harmonic Motion
c) Linear accelerated motion
d) Angular accelerated motion
a
8. To determine moment of inertia of a rigid object both bifilar and trifilar suspensions can be used.
a) True
b) False
a
