a) 90 RPM
b) 100 RPM
c) 80 RPM
d) none of the mentioned
a
30 x 210 = 40 x Resultant speed
or, Resultant speed = 90 RPM.
4. Inertia force acts

c) opposite to the direction of accelerating force
d) none of the mentioned
c
5. The frequency of oscillation at moon compared to earth will be
a) 6 times more
b) 6 times less
c) 2.44 times more
d) 2.44 times less
d
since on moon gravitational force g becomes 1/6g
therefore, frequency = 2.44 times less.

a) IP ∞ f
b) IP ∞ f2
c) IP ∞ 1/f2
d) none of the mentioned
c

The frequency of oscillation of a cylinder inside a cylinder inside a cylindrical concave surface of bigger radius compared to a small radius will be less.
8. The frequency of oscillation of a cylinder inside a cylinder inside a cylindrical concave surface of bigger radius compared to a small radius will be
a) less
b) more
c) same
d) none of the mentioned
a
The frequency of oscillation of a cylinder inside a cylinder inside a cylindrical concave surface of bigger radius compared to a small radius will be less.
9. If the radius of gyration of a compound pendulum about an axis through c.g. is more, then its frequency of oscillation will be
a) less
b) more
c) same
d) none of the mentioned
a
The frequency of oscillation of a cylinder inside a cylinder inside a cylindrical concave surface of bigger radius compared to a small radius will be less.
10. The Bifilar suspension method is used to determine
a) natural frequency of vibration

c) moment of inertia
d) none of the mentioned
c
11. The natural frequency of a spring-mass system on earth is ωn. The natural frequency of this system on the moon (gmoon =gearth/6) is
a) ωn
b) 0.408ωn
c) 0.204ωn
d) 0.167ωn
a
ωn = √k/m ………………….(i)
This equation (i) does not depend on the g and weight (W = mg)
So, the natural frequency of a spring mass system is unchanged on the moon.
Hence, it will remain ωn , i.e. ωmoon =ωn.
12. An automotive engine weighing 240 kg is supported on four springs with linear characteristics. Each of the front two springs have a stiffness of 16MN/m while the stiffness of each rear spring is 32MN/m. The engine speed (in rpm), at which resonance is likely to occur, is
a) 6040
b) 3020
c) 1424
d) 955
a
Here, k1 & k2 are the front two springs or k3 and k4 are the rear two springs.
These 4 springs are parallel, So equivalent stiffness
keq = k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 = 16 + 16 + 32 + 32 = 96MN/m2
We know at resonance
ω = ωn = √k/m
2πN/60 = √keq/m               N =Engine speed in rpm
N = 60/2π√keq/m
  = 60/2π√96 x 106/240
  = 6040 rpm.
13. A vehicle suspension system consists of a spring and a damper. The stiffness of the spring is 3.6 kN/m and the damping constant of the damper is 400 Ns/m. If the mass is 50 kg, then the damping factor (d ) and damped natural frequency (fn), respectively, are
a) 0.471 and 1.19 Hz
b) 0.471 and 7.48 Hz
c) 0.666 and 1.35 Hz
d) 0.666 and 8.50 Hz
a
We know that, Natural Frequency
ωn = √k/m = 8.485 rad/ sec
And damping factor is given by,
d or ε = c/cc
       = 0.471
Damping Natural frequency,
ωd = √1 – ε2ωn
2πfd = √1 – ε2ωn
fd = 1.19 Hz.
14. For an under damped harmonic oscillator, resonance
a) occurs when excitation frequency is greater than undamped natural frequency
b) occurs when excitation frequency is less than undamped natural frequency
c) occurs when excitation frequency is equal to undamped natural frequency
d) never occurs
c
ωd = ωn.
15. A vibratory system consists of a mass 12.5 kg, a spring of stiffness 1000N/m , and a dash-pot with damping coefficient of 15 Ns/m.The value of critical damping of the system is
a) 0.223 Ns/m
b) 17.88 Ns/m
c) 71.4 Ns/m
d) 223.6 Ns/m
d
Critical Damping,
cc = 2m√k/m = 2√km
On substituting the values, we get
cc = 223.6 Ns/m.
