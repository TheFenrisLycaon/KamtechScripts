7. A helical spring, of negligible mass, and which is found to extend 0.25 mm under a mass of 1.5 kg, is made to support a mass of 60 kg. The spring and the mass system is displaced vertically through 12.5 mm and released. Determine the frequency of natural vibration of the system.
a) 6 Hz
b) 4.98 Hz
c) 5.98 Hz
d) none of the mentioned
b
Since a mass of 1.5 kg extends the spring by 0.25 mm, therefore a mass of 60 kg will extend the spring by an amount,
δ = 0.25/1.5 x 60 = 10 mm = 0.01m
We know that frequency of the system,
n = 1/2π√g/δ = 1/2π√9.81/0.01 = 4.98 Hz.
8. A helical spring, of negligible mass, and which is found to extend 0.25 mm under a mass of 1.5 kg, is made to support a mass of 60 kg. The spring and the mass system is displaced vertically through 12.5 mm and released. Find the velocity of the mass, when it is 5 mm below its rest position.
a) 0.36 m/s
b) 0.46 m/s
c) 0.56 m/s
d) none of the mentioned
a
Since a mass of 1.5 kg extends the spring by 0.25 mm, therefore a mass of 60 kg will extend the spring by an amount,
δ = 0.25/1.5 x 60 = 10 mm = 0.01m
We know that frequency of the system,
n = 1/2π√g/δ = 1/2π√9.81/0.01 = 4.98 Hz
Let v = Linear velocity of the mass.
We know that angular velocity,
ω = √g/δ = √9.81/0.01 = 31.32 rad/s
and
v = ω√r2 – x2
  = 31.32√(0.0125)2 − (0.005)2 = 0.36 m/s.
