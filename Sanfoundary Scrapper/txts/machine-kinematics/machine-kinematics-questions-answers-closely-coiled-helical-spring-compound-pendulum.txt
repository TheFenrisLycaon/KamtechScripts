3. Two concentric springs with stiffness equal to 100 N/mm and 80 N/mm respectively, when subjected to a load of 900 N will deflect by
a) 9 mm
b) 11.25 mm
c) 5 mm
d) 31.5 mm

1/Kt = K1 + K2
                = 100+ 80 = 180N/mm
Therefore, deflection = Force/stiffness
                      = 900N/180N/mm
                      = 5 mm.

8. A connecting rod of mass 5.5 kg is placed on a horizontal platform whose mass is 1.5 kg. It is suspended by three equal wires, each 1.25 m long, from a rigid support. The wires are equally spaced round the circumference of a circle of 125 mm radius. When the c.g. of the connecting rod coincides with the axis of the circle, the platform makes 10 angular oscillations in 30 seconds. Determine the mass moment of inertia about an axis through its c.g.
a) 0.198 kg-m2
b) 1.198 kg-m2
c) 2.198 kg-m2
d) 3.198 kg-m2
a
Since the platform makes 10 angular oscillations in 30 s, therefore frequency of oscillation,
n = 10/30 = 1/3 Hz
Let kG = Radius of gyration about an axis through the c.g.
We know that frequency of oscillation (n)
1/3 = r/2πkG √g/l = 0.125/2πkG√9.81/1.25 = 0.056/kG
kG = 0.056 x 3 = 0.168 m
and mass moment of inertia about an axis through its c.g.,
I = mk2G = (m1 + m2)k2G
  = (5.5 + 1.5) (0.168)2 kg-m2
  = 0.198 kg-m2.
9. In order to find the radius of gyration of a car, it is suspended with its axis vertical from three parallel wires 2.5 metres long. The wires are attached to the rim at points spaced 120° apart and at equal distances 250 mm from the axis. It is found that the wheel makes 50 torsional oscillations of small amplitude about its axis in 170 seconds. Find the radius of gyration of the wheel.
a) 168 mm
b) 268 mm
c) 368 mm
d) 468 mm
b
Since the wheel makes 50 torsional oscillations in 170 seconds, therefore frequency of oscillation,
n = 50/170 = 5/17 Hz
Let kG = Radius of gyration of the wheel
We know that frequency of oscillation (n),
5/17 = r/2πkG √g/l  = 0.25/2πkG√9.81/2.5 = 0.079/kG
kG = 0.079 x 17/5 = 0.268 m = 268 mm.
10. A small connecting rod of mass 1.5 kg is suspended in a horizontal plane by two wires 1.25 m long. The wires are attached to the rod at points 120 mm on either side of the centre of gravity. If the rod makes 20 oscillations in 40 seconds, find the radius of gyration of the rod about a vertical axis through the centre of gravity.
a) 107 mm
b) 207 mm
c) 307 mm
d) 407 mm
a
Since the rod makes 20 oscillations in 40 s, therefore frequency of oscillation,
n = 20/40 = 0.5 Hz
Let kG = Radius of gyration of the connecting rod.
We know that frequency of oscillation (n),
0.5 = 1/2πkG √gxy/l = 1/2πkG √9.81 x 0.12 x 0.12/1.25 = 0.0535/k
kG = 0.0535/0.5 = 0.107 m = 107 mm.
11. A small connecting rod of mass 1.5 kg is suspended in a horizontal plane by two wires 1.25 m long. The wires are attached to the rod at points 120 mm on either side of the centre of gravity. If the rod makes 20 oscillations in 40 seconds, find the mass moment of inertia of the rod about a vertical axis through the centre of gravity.
a) 0.014 kg-m2
b) 0.015 kg-m2
c) 0.016 kg-m2
d) 0.017 kg-m2
d
Since the rod makes 20 oscillations in 40 s, therefore frequency of oscillation,
n = 20/40 = 0.5 Hz
Let kG = Radius of gyration of the connecting rod.
We know that frequency of oscillation (n),
0.5 = 1/2πkG √gxy/l = 1/2πkG √9.81 x 0.12 x 0.12/1.25 = 0.0535/k
kG = 0.0535/0.5 = 0.107 m = 107 mm
We know that mass moment of inertia,
I = mk2G = 1.5(0.107)2 = 0.017 kg-m2.
