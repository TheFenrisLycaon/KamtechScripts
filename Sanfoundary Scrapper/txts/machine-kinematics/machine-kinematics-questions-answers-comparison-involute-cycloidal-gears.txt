1. The velocity of sliding _____________ the distance of the point of contact from the pitch point.
a) is directly proportional to
b) is inversaly proportional to
c) is equal to cosɸ multiplied by
d) does not depend upon
a
2. In involute gears, the pressure angle is
a) dependent on the size of teeth
b) dependent on the size of gears
c) always constant
d) always variable
c
3. In full depth 140 involute system, the smallest number of teeth in a pinion which meshes with rack without interference is
a) 12
b) 16
c) 25
d) 32
d

5. The contact ratio is given by
a) Length of the path of approach/Circular pitch
b) Length of the path of recess/Circular pitch
c) Length of the arc of contact/Circular pitch
d) Length of the arc of approach/cosɸ
c
6. For an involute gear, the ratio of base circle radius and pitch circle radius is equal to
a) sinɸ
b) cosɸ
c) secɸ
d) cosecɸ
b
7. Which of the following statement is correct for gears?
a) The addendum is less than the dedendum
b) The pitch circle diameter is the product of module and number of teeth
c) The contact ratio means the number of pairs of teeth in contact
d) All of the mentioned
d
8. In a gear having involute teeth, the normal to the involute is a tangent to the
a) pitch circle
b) base circle
c) addendum circle
d) dedendum circle
b
Dedendum circle is the circle drawn through the bottom of the teeth. It is also called root circle.
Pitch circle is an imaginary circle which by pure rolling action, would give the same motion as the actual gear.
9. The centre distance between two meshing involute gears is equal to
a) sum of base circle radii/cosɸ
b) difference of base circle radii/cosɸ
c) sum of pitch circle radii/cosɸ
d) difference of pitch circle radii/cosɸ
a
10. When the tip of a tooth undercuts the root on its mating gear, it is known as interference.
a) True
b) False
a
