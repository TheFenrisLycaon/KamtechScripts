1. Which of the following shape of the body can be considered as compound pendulum?
a) Cylindrical
b) Cubical
c) Cuboidal
d) Any rigid body
d
2. Compound pendulum needs to be spherical in shape.
a) True
b) False
b
3. If the mass of the object is doubled then what will be the effect of time period of the compound pendulum?
a) Doubled
b) Remains same
c) Halved
d) Decreases by √2 times
d
(2π)\(\sqrt{(\frac{I}{mgl})}\), now the dependency of the time period on the mass is inversely proportional to the root of mass, hence it decreases by √2 times.
4. If the mass moment inertia of the object is increased to 4 times then what will be the effect of time period of the compound pendulum?
a) Doubled
b) Remains same
c) Halved
d) Decreases by √2 times
a
(2π)\(\sqrt{(\frac{I}{mgl})}\), now the dependency of the time period on the mass moment of inertia is directly proportional to the root of Moment of Inertia, hence it increases by 2 times.
5. Calculate the time period of an object having mass moment of inertia = 100 Kg-m2, mass of 10 Kg and the centre of gravity lies at a point 20 cm below the point of suspension.
a) 14.1
b) 15.2
c) 13.3
d) 12.9
a
  (2π)\(\sqrt{(\frac{I}{mgl})}\) 
substituting the values we get
T = 14.1 sec.
6. Calculate the frequency of vibration in Hz of an object having mass moment of inertia = 100 Kg-m2, mass of 10 Kg and the centre of gravity lies at a point 20 cm below the point of suspension.
a) 0.14
b) 0.15
c) 0.13
d) 0.07
d
  (2π)\(\sqrt{(\frac{I}{mgl})}\) 
substituting the values we get
T = 14.1 sec.
f = 1/T = 0.07 Hz.
7. Calculate the moment of inertia of an object having time period = 14 sec, mass of 10 Kg and the centre of gravity lies at a point 20 cm below the point of suspension.
a) 94.1
b) 95.2
c) 93.3
d) 97.4
d
  (2π)\(\sqrt{(\frac{I}{mgl})}\) 
substituting the values we get
I = 97.4 Kg-m2.
8. All simple pendulums are compound pendulums.
a) True
b) False
a
9. If the mass moment inertia of the object is increased to 4 times then what will be the effect of time period of the simple pendulum?
a) Doubled
b) Remains same
c) Halved
d) Decreases by √2 times
b
(2π)√(I/g), now the dependency of the time period on the mass moment of inertia is non existent, hence it remains unchanged.
10. Calculate the moment of inertia of an object having time period = 14 sec, mass moment of inertia= 100 Kg-m2 and the centre of gravity lies at a point 20 cm below the point of suspension.
a) 9.1
b) 9.2
c) 9.3
d) 10.2
d
(2π)\(\sqrt{(\frac{I}{mgl})}\) 
substituting the values we get
m = 10.2 Kg.
