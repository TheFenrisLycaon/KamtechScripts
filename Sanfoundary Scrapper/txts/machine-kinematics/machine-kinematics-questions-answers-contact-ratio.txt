1. The tooth profile most commonly used in gear drives for power transmission is
a) A cycloid
b) An involute
c) An ellipse
d) A parabola
b
2. There are six gears A, B, C, D, E, F in a compound train. The numbers of teeth in the gears are 20, 60, 30, 80, 25 and 75 respectively. The ratio of the angular speeds of the driven (F) to the driver (A) of the drive is
a) 1/24
b) 1/8
c) 4/15
d) 12
a
                                                   = 20 x 30 x 25/60 x 80 x 75
                                                   = 1/24.
3. A fixed gear having 100 teeth meshes with another gear having 25 teeth, the centre lines of both the gears being joined by an arm so as to form an epicyclic gear train. The number of rotations made by the smaller gear for one rotation of the arm is
a) 3
b) 4
c) 5
d) 6
c
                                         = 1 + 100/25 =5.
4. Speed reduction in a gear box is achieved using a worm and worm wheel. The worm wheel has 30 teeth and a pitch diameter of 210 mm. If the pressure angle of the worm is 20o, what is the axial pitch of the worm?
a) 7 mm
b) 22 mm
c) 14 mm
d) 63 mm
b
P = πm = 22/7 x 7
  = 22 mm
Axial pitch = circular pitch of the worm wheel = πm.
5. A speed reducer unit consists of a double-threaded worm of pitch = 11 mm and a worm wheel of pitch diameter = 84 mm. The ratio of the output torque to the input to rque is
a) 7·6
b) 12
c) 24
d) 42
a
                                        = 84/11
                                        = 7.6.
6. A pair of gears forms a rolling pair.
a) True
b) False
b
7. Spiral bevel gears designed to be used with an offset in their shafts are called ‘hypoid gears’
a) True
b) False
a
8. Gears with involute tooth profile transmit constant velocity ratios between shafts connected by them.
a) True
b) False
a
9. In the case of spur gears, the mating teeth execute pure rolling motion with respect to each other from the commencement of engagement to its termination.
a) True
b) False
a
10. A pair of helical gears has fewer teeth in contact as compared to an equivalent pair of spur gears.
a) True
b) False
b
