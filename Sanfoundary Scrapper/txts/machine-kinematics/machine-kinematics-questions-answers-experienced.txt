1. A body is said to vibrate with simple harmonic motion if its acceleration is proportional to the distance from the mean position.
a) True
b) False
a
a) Its acceleration is always directed towards the center, known as point of reference or mean position.
b) Its acceleration is proportional to the distance from that point.
2. The maximum displacement of a body, from its mean position is called amplitude.
a) True
b) False
a
             The maximum displacement of a body from its mean position is called amplitude.
3. Frequency of vibrations is usually expressed in
a) number of cycles per hour
b) number of cycles per minute
c) number of cycles per second
d) none of the mentioned
c
4. The amplitude of vibrations is always ______________ the radius of the circle.
a) equal to
b) less than
c) greater than
d) none of the mentioned
a
5. The time taken by a particle for one complete oscillation is known as periodic time.

6. The periodic time is given by
a) ω/2п
b) 2п/ω
c) ω x 2п
d) п/ω
b
where  ω = Angular velocity of the particle in rad/s.
7. When a body moves with simple harmonic motion, the product of its periodic time and frequency is equal to
a) zero
b) one
c) п/2
d) п
b
8. The acceleration of the particle moving with simple harmonic motion is ____________ at the mean position.
a) zero
b) minimum
c) maximum
d) none of the mentioned
a
9. The maximum velocity of a particle moving with simple harmonic motion is
a) ω
b) ωr
c) ω2r
d) ω/r
b
               v = ω√r2 – x2
The velocity is maximum at the mean position i.e. when x = 0.
Hence, v = ωr.
10. When a particle moves round the circumference of a circle of radius r with ω rad/s, then its maximum acceleration is ω2r.
a) True
b) False
a
                      a = ω2r.

b) 0.15 m/s
c) 0.8 m/s
d) 0.16 m/s
b
12. A particle executes linear simple harmonic motion with an amplitude of 2 cm. When the particle is at 1 cm from the mean position, the magnitude of its velocity is equal to that of its acceleration. Then its time period in seconds is
a) 1/ 2π√3
b) 2π√3
c) 2π/√3
d) √3/2π
b
13. Suppose you place a sphere of mass ‘m’ and radius ‘r’ inside a smooth, heavy hemispherical bowl of radius of 37r placed on a horizontal table. If the sphere is given a small displacement, what is its period of oscillation?

b) 2π√(m/rg)
c) 12π√(r/g)
d) 2π√(r/g)
c
14. The instantaneous displacement of a simple harmonic oscillator is given by y = A cos(ωt + π/4). Its speed will be maximum at the time
a) 2π/ω
b) ω/2π
c) ω/π
d) π/4ω
d
15. A particle of mass 5 g is executing simple harmonic motion with an amplitude 0.3 m and time period π/5 s. The maximum value of the force acting on the particle is
a) 5 N
b) 4 N
c) 0.5 N
d) 0.15 N
d
