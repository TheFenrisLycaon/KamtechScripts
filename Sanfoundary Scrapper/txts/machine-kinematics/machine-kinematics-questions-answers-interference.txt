a
7. Given,
Involute profile teeths of mating gear: 20 and 40
Pressure angle = 20°
module = 10mm
The constraint: The addendum on each wheel is to be made of such a length that the line of contact on each side of the pitch point has half the maximum possible length.
Find the addendum height for the larger gear wheel in mm.
a) 6.5
b) 6
c) 6.8
d) 7
a
R = 200mm
Using the constraint we find that
Ra = 206.5mm
Therefore
Addendum height = 6.5mm.
8. Given:
Involute profile teeths of mating gear: 20 and 40
Pressure angle = 20°
module = 10mm
The constraint: The addendum on each wheel is to be made of such a length that the line of contact on each side of the pitch point has half the maximum possible length.
Find the addendum height for the smaller gear wheel in mm.
a) 6.4
b) 6.2
c) 6.3
d) 6
b
R = 200mm
Using the constraint we find that
ra = 106.2mm
Therefore
Addendum height = 6.2mm.
9. Given:
Involute profile teeths of mating gear: 20 and 40
Pressure angle = 20°
module = 10mm
The constraint: The addendum on each wheel is to be made of such a length that the line of contact on each side of the pitch point has half the maximum possible length.
Find the length of path of contact in mm.
a) 56.4
b) 56.2
c) 56.3
d) 51.3
d
R = 200mm
We know that length of path of contact = (R+r)sinΦ/2
= 51.3mm.
10. Given:
Involute profile teeths of mating gear: 20 and 40
Pressure angle = 20°
module = 10mm
The constraint: The addendum on each wheel is to be made of such a length that the line of contact on each side of the pitch point has half the maximum possible length.
Find the length of arc of contact in mm.
a) 56.4
b) 54.6
c) 56.3
d) 51.3
b
R = 200mm
We know that length of path of contact = (R+r)sinΦ/2
= 51.3mm
Arc of contact = length of path of contact / cosΦ
= 54.6mm.
11. Given:
Involute profile teeths of mating gear: 20 and 40
Pressure angle = 20°
module = 10mm
The constraint: The addendum on each wheel is to be made of such a length that the line of contact on each side of the pitch point has half the maximum possible length.
Find the contact ratio.
a) 1.23
b) 1.52
c) 1.74
d) 1.97
c
R = 200mm
We know that length of path of contact = (R+r)sinΦ/2
= 51.3mm
Pitch = πx10 = 31.42
Contact ratio = length of path of contact/pitch
= 1.74.
