1. The number of degrees of freedom of a planer linkage with 8 links and 9 simple revolute joints is
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
c
No. of revolute joints, J = 9
No. of higher pair, h = 0
Number of degree of freedom, n = 3(I -1) – 2j – h
                               = 3(8 – 1) – 2×9 – 0 = 3.
2. A palnar mechanism has 8 links and 10 rotary joints. The number of degrees of freedom of the mechanism, using Grubler’s criterion, is
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) 3
b
Degree of freedom  is given by = 3(I – 1) – 2j = 3(8 -1) – (2×10) = 1.

3. Grashof’s law – Continuous relative rotation
4. Kennedy’s theorem – Velocity and acceleration.
4. Which of the following statements is incorrect
a) Grashof’s rule states that for a planar crank-rocker four bar mechanism, the sum of the shortest and longest link lengths cannot be less than the sum of the remaining two link lengths.
b) Inversions of a mechanism are created by fixing different links one at a time.
c) Geneva mechanism is an intermittent motion device.
d) Gruebler’s criterion assumes mobality of a planar mechanism to be one.

5. In a four bar linkage, s denotes the shortest link length, L is the longest link length, P and Q are the lengths of other two links. At least one of the three moving links will rotate by 360° if
a) S + L < P + Q
b) S + L > P + Q
c) S + P < L + Q
d) S + P > L + Q
a
i.e.  S + L < P + Q.
6. The number of inversions for a slider crank mechanism is

c) A closed 4bar chain having 2 revolute and 2 sliding pairs
d) An inversion of single slider crank chain
d
8. Match the following
     Types of mechanism                                 Motion achieved

c
1. Intermittent motion – Geneva mechanism
2. Quick return motion – Off set slider crank mechanism
3. Simple harmonic motion – scotch Yoke mechanism
4. Straight line motion – Scott Russel mechanism.
