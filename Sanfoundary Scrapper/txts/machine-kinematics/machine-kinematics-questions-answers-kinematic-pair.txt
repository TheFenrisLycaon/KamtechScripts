5. In an open pair, the two elements of a pair
a) have a surface contact when in motion
b) have a line or point contact when in motion
c) are kept in contact by the action of external forces, when in motion
d) are not held mechanically
d
6. The sliding pairs, turning pairs and screw pairs form lower pairs.
a) True
b) False
a
7. A combination of kinematic pairs, joined in such a way that the relative motion between the links is completely constrained, is called a
a) structure
b) mechanism
c) kinematic chain
d) inversion
c
8. The relation between number of pairs(p) forming a kinematic chain and the number of links(l) is
a) l = 2p – 2
b) l = 2p – 3
c) l = 2p – 4
d) l = 2p – 5
c
9. The relation between number of links(l) and number of joints(j) in a kinematic chain is
