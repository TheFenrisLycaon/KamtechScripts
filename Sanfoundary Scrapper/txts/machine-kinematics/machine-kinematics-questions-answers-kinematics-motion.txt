1. The unit of linear acceleration is
a) kg-m
b) m/s
c) m/s2
d) rad/s2
c
i.e a = v/t
and unit of velocity is m/s
so, unit of linear acceleration becomes m/s2.
2. The angular velocity (in rad/s) of a body rotating at N r.p.m. is
a) π N/60
b) 2 π N/60
c) π N/120
d) π N/180
b
Mathematically, angular velocity,
                          ω =dθ/dt
If a body is rotating at the rate of N r.p.m. (revolutions per minute), then its angular velocity,
                 ω = 2πΝ / 60 rad/s
3. The linear velocity of a body rotating at ω rad/s along a circular path of radius r is given by
a) ω.r
b) ω/r
c) ωs2.r
d) ωs2/r
a
therefore, the linear velocity will be
              ω.r 
4. When a particle moves along a straight path, then the particle has
a) tangential acceleration only
b) centripetal acceleration only
c) both tangential and centripetal acceleration
d) none of the mentioned
a
5. When a particle moves with a uniform velocity along a circular path, then the particle has
a) tangential acceleration only
b) centripetal acceleration only
c) both tangential and centripetal acceleration
d) none of the mentioned
b

6. When the motion of a body is confined to only one plane, the motion is said to be
a) plane motion
b) rectilinear motion
c) curvilinear Motion
d) none of the mentioned
a
7. _______________ is the simplest type of motion and is along a straight line path.
a) plane motion
b) rectilinear motion
c) curvilinear Motion
d) none of the mentioned
b
8. _________________ is the motion along a curved path.
a) plane motion
b) rectilinear motion
c) curvilinear Motion
d) none of the mentioned
c
9. Displacement of a body is a ___________ quantity.
a) scalar
b) vector
c) scalar and vector
d) none of the mentioned
b
10. A train covers 60 miles between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. How fast was it going at 3 p.m.?
a) 60 mph
b) 30 mph
c) 40 mph
d) 50 mph
b
                                   60 miles/ 2 hours = 30 mph
