1. The force which acts along the radius of a circle and directed ____________ the centre of the circle is known as centripetal force.
a) away from
b) towards
c) at the
d) none of the mentioned
b
2. The unit of mass moment of inertia in S.I. units is
a) m4
b) kgf-m-s2
c) kg-m2
d) N-m
c
3. Joule is a unit of
a) force
b) work
c) power
d) none of the mentioned
b
4. The energy possessed by a body, for doing work by virtue of its position, is called
a) potential energy
b) kinetic energy
c) electrical energy
d) chemical energy
a
Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by a body, for doing work, by virtue of its mass and velocity of motion.
5. When a body of mass moment of inertia I (about a given axis) is rotated about that axis with an angular velocity, then the kinetic energy of rotation is
a) 0.5 I.ω
b) I.ω
c) 0.5 I.ω2
d) I.ω2
c
Kinetic energy of rotation = 1/ 2I.ω2
 When a body has both linear and angular motions e.g. in the locomotive driving wheels and wheels of a moving car, then the total kinetic energy of the body is equal to the sum of kinetic energies of translation and rotation.
∴ Total kinetic energy = 1/ 2mv2 +1/ 2I.ω2
6. The wheels of a moving car possess
a) potential energy only
b) kinetic energy of translation only
c) kinetic energy of rotation only
d) kinetic energy of translation and rotation both.
d
7. The bodies which rebound after impact are called
a) inelastic bodies
b) elastic bodies
c) solid bodies
d) none of the mentioned
b
8. The coefficient of restitution for inelastic bodies is
a) zero
b) between zero and one
c) one
d) more than one
a
9. Which of the following statement is correct ?
a) The kinetic energy of a body during impact remains constant.
b) The kinetic energy of a body before impact is equal to the kinetic energy of a body after impact.
c) The kinetic energy of a body before impact is less than the kinetic energy of a body after impact.
d) The kinetic energy of a body before impact is more than the kinetic energy of a body after impact.
d
E1 = 1/2 m1 (u1)2 + 1/2 m2 (u2)2
When the two bodies move with the same velocity v after impact, then
Kinetic energy of the system after impact,
 E2= 1/2( m1 + m2) v2
∴ Loss of kinetic energy during impact,
 EL = E1 – E2
10. A body of mass m moving with a constant velocity v strikes another body of same mass m moving with same velocity but in opposite direction. The common velocity of both the bodies after collision is
a) v
b) 2 v
c) 4 v
d) 8 v
b
We know that Common velocity = V1 – 2
Here both the velocities are same.
Therefore Common velocity = V – (-V)
                                           = V + V = 2V
