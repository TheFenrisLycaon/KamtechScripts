1. A multiple disc clutch has five plates having four pairs of active friction surfaces. If the intensity of pressure is not to exceed 0.127 N/mm2, find the power transmitted at 500 r.p.m. The outer and inner radii of friction surfaces are 125 mm and 75 mm respectively. Assume uniform wear and take coefficient of friction = 0.3.
a) 17.8 kW
b) 18.8 kW
c) 19.8 kW
d) 20.8 kW
b
Since the intensity of pressure is maximum at the inner radius r2, therefore
p.r2 = C or C = 0.127 × 75 = 9.525 N/mm
We know that axial force required to engage the clutch,
W = 2 π C (r1 – r2) = 2 π × 9.525 (125 – 75) = 2990 N
and mean radius of the friction surfaces,
R = r1 + r2/2 = 125 + 75/2 = 100 mm = 0.1 m
We know that torque transmitted,
T = n.μ.W.R = 4 × 0.3 × 2990 × 0.1 = 358.8 N-m
∴ Power transmitted,
P = T.ω = 358.8 × 52.4 = 18 800 W = 18.8 kW.
2. A single plate clutch, with both sides effective, has outer and inner diameters 300 mm and 200 mm respectively. The maximum intensity of pressure at any point in the contact surface is not to exceed 0.1 N/mm2. If the coefficient of friction is 0.3, determine the power transmitted by a clutch at a speed 2500 r.p.m.
a) 61.693 kW
b) 71.693 kW
c) 81.693 kW
d) 91.693 kW
a
Since the intensity of pressure ( p) is maximum at the inner radius (r2), therefore for uniform wear,
p.r2 = C or C = 0.1 × 100 = 10 N/mm
We know that the axial thrust,
W = 2 π C (r1 – r2) = 2 π × 10 (150 – 100) = 3142 N
and mean radius of the friction surfaces for uniform wear,
R = r1 + r2/2 = 150 + 100/2 = 125 mm = 0.125m
We know that torque transmitted,
T = n.μ.W.R = 2 × 0.3 × 3142 × 0.125 = 235.65 N-m           …( n = 2,for both sides of plate effective)
∴ Power transmitted by a clutch,
P = T.ω = 235.65 × 261.8 = 61 693 W = 61.693 kW.
3. A 60 mm diameter shaft running in a bearing carries a load of 2000 N. If the coefficient of friction between the shaft and bearing is 0.03, find the power transmitted when it runs at 1440 r.p.m.
a) 171.4 W
b) 271.4 W
c) 371.4 W
d) 471.4 W
b
or ω = 2π × 1440/60 = 150.8 rad/s
We know that torque transmitted,
T = μ.W.r = 0.03 × 2000 × 0.03 = 1.8 N-m
∴ Power transmitted, P = T.ω = 1.8 × 150.8 = 271.4 W.
