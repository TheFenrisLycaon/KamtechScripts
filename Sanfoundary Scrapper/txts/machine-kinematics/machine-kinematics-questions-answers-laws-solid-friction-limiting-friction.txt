8. A body of mass 400 g slides on a rough horizontal surface. If the frictional force is 3.0 N, find the angle made by the contact force on the body with the vertical.
a) 350
b) 360
c) 370
d) 380
c
The component of F perpendicular to the contact surface is the normal force N and the component of F parallel to the surface is the friction f As the surface is horizontal, N is vertically upward. For vertical equilibrium,
N = mg = (0.400 kg) (10 m/s2) = 4.0 N.
The frictional force is f = 3.0 N.
tan ϴ = f/N = 3/4
or, ϴ = tan-1 (3/4) = 370.
9. A body of mass 400 g slides on a rough horizontal surface. If the frictional force is 3.0 N, find the magnitude of the contact force.
a) 5 N
b) 10 N
c) 15 N
d) 20 N
a
The component of F perpendicular to the contact surface is the normal force N and the component of F parallel to the surface is the friction f As the surface is horizontal, N is vertically upward. For vertical equilibrium,
N = mg = (0.400 kg) (10 m/s2) = 4.0 N.
The frictional force is f = 3.0 N.
 F = √N2
   = √42 + 32 = 5 N.
10. A heavy box of mass 20 kg is pulled on a horizontal surface by applying a horizontal force. If the coefficient of kinetic friction between the box and the horizontal surface is 0.25, find the force of friction exerted by the horizontal surface on the box.
a) 29 N
b) 39 N
c) 49 N
d) 59 N
c
f = μN
  = μmg
  = 0.25 x (20 kg) x (9.8 m/s 2) = 49 N.
This force acts in the direction opposite to the pull.
11. A boy (30 kg) sitting on his horse whips it. The horse speeds up at an average acceleration of 2.0 m/s 2.If the boy does not slide back, what is the force of friction exerted by the horse on the boy ?
a) 20 N
b) 30 N
c) 40 N
d) 60 N
d
(i) the weight Mg.
(ii) the normal contact force N and
(iii) the static friction fs
As the boy does not slide back, its acceleration a is equal to the acceleration of the horse. As friction is the only horizontal force, it must act along the acceleration and its magnitude is given by Newton’s second law
fs = Ma = (30 kg) (2.0 m/s2) = 60 N.
12. A boy (30 kg) sitting on his horse whips it. The horse speeds up at an average acceleration of 2.0 m/s 2.If the boy slides back during the acceleration, what can be said about the coefficient of static friction between the horse and the boy.
a) 0.10
b) 0.20
c) 0.30
d) 0.40
b
friction of 60 N on the boy. The maximum force of static
friction that the horse may exert on the boy is
fs = μs = μsMg
μs(30 kg) (10m/s2) = μs 300 N
where μs is the coefficient of static friction. Thus,
μs(300 N) <60 N
or, μs <60/300 = 0.20.
13. A wooden block is kept on a polished wooden plank and the inclination of the plank is gradually increased. It is found that the block starts slipping when the plank makes an angle of 18° with the horizontal. However, once started the block can continue with uniform speed if the inclination is reduced to 15°. Find the coefficient of static friction between the block and the plank.
a) tan 180
b) tan 150
c) tan 330
d) tan 30
a
μs = tan 180.
