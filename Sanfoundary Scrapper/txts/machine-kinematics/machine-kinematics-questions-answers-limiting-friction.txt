10. A body of mass 1 kg is kept on a rough surface having coefficient of friction = 0.25 being pulled by a force of 2N, what will be the value of friction force in N?
a) 2
b) 2.5
c) 0
d) 4
a
The acting friction will be static having a value of 2N. 
11. A body of mass 1 kg is kept on a rough surface having coefficient of friction = 0.25 being pulled by a force of 2N, which frictional force will be acting on the body?
a) Limiting friction
b) Static friction
c) Kinetic friction
d) Rolling friction
b
The acting friction will be static friction and the body will stay at rest.
12. A body of mass 1 kg is kept on a rough surface having coefficient of friction = 0.25 being pulled by a force of 2N, after how long will the body come to rest again?
a) 2s
b) 2.5s
c) 0s
d) 4s
c
The acting friction will be static friction and the body will stay at rest and will not undergo any motion until the applied force exceeds the value of limiting friction.
13. A body, resting on a rough horizontal plane required a pull of 181 N inclined at 30° to the plane just to move it. It was recorded that a push of 220 N inclined at 30° to the plane just moved the body. Estimate the weight of the body in N.
a) 2000N
b) 2500N
c) 1000N
d) 4000N
c
horizontally,
f = 181cos30
Now considering a push of 220N
horizontally
f =220cos30
vertically
R = W + 220sin30
solving the equations we get
W = 1000N.
14. A body, resting on a rough horizontal plane required a pull of 181 N inclined at 30° to the plane just to move it. It was recorded that a push of 220 N inclined at 30°° to the plane just moved the body. Estimate the coefficient of friction.
a) 0.17
b) 0.2
c) 0.5
d) 0.75
a
horizontally,
f = 181cos30
Now considering a push of 220N
horizontally
f = 220cos30
vertically
R = W + 220sin30
solving the equations we get
μ = 0.171.
15. A body of mass 1 kg is kept on a rough surface is being pulled by a force of 2N, what will be the value of coefficient of friction if it just begins to move. Take g = 10m/s2.
a) 0.2
b) 0.25
c) 0
d) 0.4
a
Since the body just begins to move, we have
f = μN = 2N
therefore
μx10 = 2N
μ = 0.2.
