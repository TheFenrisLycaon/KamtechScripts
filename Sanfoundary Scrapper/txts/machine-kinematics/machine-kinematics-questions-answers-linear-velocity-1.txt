b) ω(AB)2
c) ω2AB
d) (ω x AB)2
a
3. The direction of linear velocity of any point on a link with respect to another point on the same link is
a) parallel to the link joining the points
b) perpendicular to the link joining the points

b
4. The two links OA and OB are connected by a pin joint at O. If the link OA turns with angular velocity ω1 rad/s in the clockwise direction and the link OB turns with angular velocity ω2 rad/s in the anti-clockwise direction, then the rubbing velocity at the pin joint O is
a) ω1.ω2.r
b) (ω1-ω2)r
c) (ω1+ω2)r
d) (ω1-ω2)2r
c
Let ω1 = Angular velocity of the link OA or the angular velocity of the point A with respect to O.
ω2 = Angular velocity of the link OB or the angular velocity of the point B with respect to O, and
r = Radius of the pin.
According to the definition,
Rubbing velocity at the pin joint O
= (ω1 – ω2) r, if the links move in the same direction
= (ω1 + ω2) r, if the links move in the opposite direction

6. ABCD is a four bar mechanism in which AB = 310mm and CD = 450mm. AB and CD are both perpendicular to the fixed link AD. If the velocity of B at this condition is v. Then the velocity of C is
a) v
v) 2/3 v
c) 3/2 v
d) 9/4 v
c
                           = 450/310 x v
                           = 3/2 v
