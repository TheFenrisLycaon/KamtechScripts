1. In its simplest form, a cam mechanism consists of following number of links
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
c
2. Which of the following mechanisms produces mathematically an exact straight line motion?
a) Grasshopper mechanism
b) Watt mechanism
c) Peaucellier’s mechanism
d) Tchabichiff mechanism
c
3. In a mechanism, usually one link is fixed. If the fixed link is changed in a kinematic chain, then relative motion of other links
a) will remain same
b) will change
c) will not occur
d) none of the mentioned
a
4. A kinematic chain requires at least
a) 2 links and 3 turning pairs
b) 3 links and 4 turning pairs
c) 4 links and 4 turning pairs
d) 5 links and 4 turning pairs
c
5. In a drag link quick return mechanism, the shortest link is always fixed. The sum of the shortest and longest link is
a) equal to sum of other two
b) greater than sum of other two
c) less than sum of other two
d) none of the mentioned
c
6. The following is the inversion of slider crank chain mechanism
a) whitworth quick return mechanism
b) hand pump
c) oscillating cylinder engine
d) all of the mentioned
d
7. Kinematic pairs are those which have
a) two elements held together mechanically
b) two elements having relative motion
c) two elements having Coroli’s component
d) none of the mentioned
b
8. According to criterion of constraint by A.W. Klein
a) J + 1/2 H = 3/2L – 2
b) H + 1/2J = 2/3L – 2
c) J + 1/2H = 3/2L – 1
d) J + 3/2H = 1/2L – 2
a
J + 1/2 H = 3/2L – 2
9. A quarternary joint is equivalent to
a) one binary joint
b) two binary joints
c) three binary joints
d) four binary joints
c
10. A typewriter mechanism has 7 number of binary joints, six links and none of higher pairs. The mechanism is
a) kinematically sound
b) not sound
c) soundness would depend upon which link is kept fixed
d) none of the mentioned
a
or, 7 + 0 = 3/2 x 6 -2
or, 7 = 7
Hence, it is Kinematically sound.
