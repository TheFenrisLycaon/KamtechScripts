6. In a four-bar linkage, S denotes the shortest link length, L is the longest link length, P and Q are the lengths of other two links. At least one of the three moving links will rotate by 3600 if
a) S + L < P + Q
b) S + L > P + Q
c) S + P < L + Q
d) S + P > L + Q
a
According to Grashof’s law : “For a four bar mechanism, the sum of the shortest and longest link lengths should not be greater than the sum of remaining two link lengths, if there is to be continuous relative motion between the two links
S + L < P + Q. 
7. The number of degrees of freedom of a planar linkage with 8 links and 9 simple revolute joints is
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
c
We know that, Degree of freedom,
n =3(l − 1)−2j = 3(8 − 1)−2 x 9 = 3.
8. The lengths of the links of a 4-bar linkage with revolute pairs are p,q,r, and s units. given that p<q<r<s. Which of these links should be the fixed one, for obtaining a “double crank” mechanism ?
a) link of length p
b) link of length q
c) link of length r
d) link of length s
a
“Double crank” mechanism occurs, when the shortest link is fixed. From the given pairs p is the shortest link. So, link of length p should be fixed.
9. When a cylinder is located in a Vee-block, the number of degrees of freedom which are arrested is
a) 2
b) 4
c) 7
d) 8
b
10. The minimum number of links in a single degree-of-freedom planar mechanism with both higher and lower kinematic pairs is
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
c
n = 3(l − 1) − 2j − h
For single degree of Freedom (n = 1),
1 = 3(l − 1) − 2j − h
3l − 2j − 4 − h = 0                   …(i)
The simplest possible mechanisms of single degree of freedom is four-bar mechanism. For this mechanism j = 4, h = 0
From equation (i), we have
3l − 2 x 4 − 4 − 0 = 0
or, l = 4.

a
13. In a mechanism, the fixed instantaneous centres are those centres which
a) remain in the same place for all configurations of the mechanism
