1. Gearing contact is which one of the following?
a) Sliding contact
b) Sliding contact, only rolling at pitch point
c) Rolling contact
d) Rolling and sliding at each point of contact
b
2. An external gear with 60 teeth meshes with a pinion of 20 teeth, module being 6 mm. What is the centre distance in mm?
a) 120
b) 180
c) 240
d) 300
c
                                   = 6/2 (60 + 20)
                                   = 240 mm

d
4. In involute gears the pressure angle is
a) Dependent on the size of teeth
b) dependent on the size of gears

5. Consider the following statements:
1. A stub tooth has a working depth larger than that of a full-depth tooth.
2. The path of contact for involute gears is an arc of a circle.
 Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
a) Only 1
b) Only 2
c) Both 1 and 2
d) Neither 1 nor 2
d
 2. The path of contact for involute gears is a line. 
6. Consider the following statements regarding the choice of conjugate teeth for the profile of mating gears:
1. They will transmit the desired motion
2. They are difficult to manufacture.
3. Standardisation is not possible
4. The cost of production is low.
 Which of these statements are correct?
a) 1, 2 and 3
b) 1, 2 and 4
c) 2, 3 and 4
d) 1, 3 and 4
a
7. Common contact ratio of a pair of spur pinion and gear is
a) Less than 1·0
b) Equal to 1
c) Between 2 and 3
d) Greater than 3
c
8. In gears, interference takes place when
a) The tip of a tooth of a mating gear digs into the portion between base and root circles
b) Gears do not move smoothly in the absence of lubrication
c) Pitch of the gear is not same
d) gear teeth are undercut
a
9. Consider the following characteristics:
1. Small interference
2. Strong tooth.
3. Low production cost
4. Gear with small number of teeth.
 Those characteristics which are applicable to stub 20° involute system would include
a) 1 alone
b) 2, 3 and 4
c) 1, 2 and 3
d) 1, 2, 3 and 4
b
10. A spur gear transmits 10 kW at a pitch line velocity of 10 m/s; driving gear has a diameter of 1.0 m. Find the tangential force between the driver and the follower, and the transmitted torque respectively.
a) 1 kN and 0.5 kN-m
b) 10 kN and 5 kN-m
c) 0.5 kN and 0.25 kN-m
d) 1 kN and 1 kN-m
a
Force = 10 x 103/10
      = 1000 N/m
Torque Transmitted = Force x diameter/2
                   = 1000 x 1/2
                   = 500 N-m
                   = 0.5 kN-m
