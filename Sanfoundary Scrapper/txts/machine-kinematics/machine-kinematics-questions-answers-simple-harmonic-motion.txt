1. The periodic time (tp) is given by
a) ω / 2 π
b) 2 π / ω
c) 2 π × ω
d) π/ω
b
∴ Periodic time, tp = 2 π/ω seconds.
2. The velocity of a particle moving with simple harmonic motion is . . . . at the mean position.
a) zero
b) minimum
c) maximum
d) none of the mentioned
c
                Vmax = ω.r.
3. The velocity of a particle (v) moving with simple harmonic motion, at any instant is given by
a) ω √r2 − x2
b) ω √x2 − r2
c) ω2 √r2 − x2
d) ω2√x2 − r2
a
4. The maximum acceleration of a particle moving with simple harmonic motion is

5. The frequency of oscillation for the simple pendulum is
a) 1/2π √L/g
b) 1/2π √g/L
c) 2π √L/g
d) 2π√g/L
b
∴ Periodic time for one beat = π √g/L
∴ Frequency = 1/2π √g/L.
6. When a rigid body is suspended vertically and it oscillates with a small amplitude under the action of the force of gravity, the body is known as
a) simple pendulum
b) torsional pendulum
c) compound pendulum
d) second’s pendulum
c
7. The frequency of oscillation of a compound pendulum is
a) 1/2π √g.h/k2G +h2
b) 1/2π √k2G +h2/g.h
c) 2π√g.h/k2G +h2
d) 2π√k2G +h2/g.h
a
              tp = 2π√Displacement/Accleration = 2π√θ/α
  and frequency of oscillation,n = 1/tp = 1/2π √g.h/k2G +h2
where kG = Radius of gyration about the centroidal axis, and
h = Distance between the point of suspension and centre of gravity of the body.
8. The equivalent length of a simple pendulum which gives the same frequency as the compound pendulum is
a) h/ k2G +h2
