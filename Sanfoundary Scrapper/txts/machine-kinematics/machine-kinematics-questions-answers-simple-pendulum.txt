1. The acceleration of the particle moving with simple harmonic motion is inversely proportional to the displacement of the particle from the mean position.
a) True
b) False
b
2. In order to double the period of a simple pendulum, the length of the string should be
a) halved
b) doubled
c) quadrupled
d) none of the mentioned
c
             So, if period is doubled, then length should be quadrupled
3. The equivalent length of simple pendulum depends upon the distance between the point of the suspension and the center of gravity.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Which of the following statement is correct?
a) The periodic time of a particle moving with simple harmonic motion is the time taken by a particle for one complete oscillation.
b) The periodic time of a particle moving with simple harmonic motion is directly proportional to its angular velocity.
c) The velocity of a particle moving with simple harmonic motion is zero at the mean position.
d) The acceleration of the particle moving with simple harmonic motion is maximum at the mean position.
a
5. The periodic time of a compound pendulum is …….. when the distance between the point of suspension and the center of gravity is equal to the radius of gyration of the body about its center of gravity.
a) zero
b) minimum
c) maximum
d) none of the mentioned
b
6. In a simple harmonic motion, the velocity vector with respect to displacement vector
a) is in phase
b) leads by 900
c) leads by 1800
d) lags by 900
d
7. The distance between the center of suspension and center of percussion is equal to the equivalent length of a simple pendulum.
a) True
b) False
a
8. The center of suspension and center of percussion are not interchangeable.
a) True
b) False
b
9. When the body is suspended at the point of suspension, its periodic time and frequency will be _____________ as compared to the body suspended at the point of percussion.
a) same
b) two times
c) four times
d) eight times
a
10. Bifilar suspension method is used to find the
a) angular acceleration of the body
b) moment of inertia of the body
c) periodic time of the body
d) frequency of vibration of the body
b
