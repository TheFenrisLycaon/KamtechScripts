      Type of joint				Motion constrained
A. Revolute				     1. Three
B. Cylindrical				     2. Five
C. Spherical				     3. Four

DOF = 6 – 1 = 5
For cylindrical pair, dof =2 and constrained dof = 6 – 2 = 4
For spherical pair, dof = 3 and constrained dof = 6 – 3 = 3.
6. The number of binary links, number of binary joints and number of ternary joints in Peaucelliar mechanism is
a) 6,6,0
b) 8,2,4
c) 8,4,2
d) 8,8,0

7. The number of degree of freedom of a planer linkage with 8 links and 9 simple revolute joints is
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
c
P = 9 = number of simple revolute joints
F = 3(L – 1) – 2P
  = 3(8 – 1) – 2 x 9
  = 21 – 18
  = 3.
8. The following list of statements is given:
1) Grashoff’s rule states that for a planar crank-rocker 4-bar mechanism, the sum of the shortest and longest link lengths cannot be less than the sum of the remaining two link lengths.
2) Inversions of a mechanism are created by fixing different links, one at a time.
3) Geneva mechanism is an intermittent motion device.
4) Grubler’s criterion assumes mobility of a planar mechanism to be one.
The number of correct statements in the above list is
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4

9. A mechanism has 8 links, out of which 5 are binary, 2 are ternary and 1 is quaternary. The number of instantaneous centres of rotation will be
a) 28
b) 56
c) 62
d) 66
d
Number of instantaneous centres, N = n(n – 1)/2
                                   = 12 x (12 – 1)/2
                                   = 66.
10. In a dynamically equivalent system, a uniformly distributed mass is divided into
a) Three point masses
b) Four point masses
c) Two point masses
d) Infinite point masses
c
11. A crank and slotted lever mechanism used in a shaper has a centre distance of 300 mm between the centre of oscillation of the slotted lever and the centre of rotation of the crank. The radius of the crank is 120 mm. Find the ratio of the time of cutting to the time of return stroke.
a) 1.62
b) 1.72
c) 1.82
d) 1.92
b
sin∠CAB = sin (90°−α/ 2)
CB/AC = 120/300 = 0.4
∠CAB = 90°−α/ 2
or α / 2 = 90° – 23.6° = 66.4°
α = 2 × 66.4 = 132.8°
We know that
Time of cutting stroke/ Time of return stroke = 1.72.

a) True
b) False

a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) 3
a
Rubbing velocity at the pin joint = ω.r
where ω = Angular velocity of the turning member, and
r = Radius of the pin.
