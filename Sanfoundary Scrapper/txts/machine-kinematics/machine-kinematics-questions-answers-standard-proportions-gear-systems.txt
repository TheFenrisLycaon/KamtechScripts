1. If T is the actual number of teeth on a helical gear and φ is the helix angle for the teeth, the formative number of teeth is written as
a) T sec3 φ
b) T sec2 φ
c) T/sec3φ
d) T cosec φ
a
              T sec3 φ 
2. In helical gears, the distance between similar faces of adjacent teeth along a helix on the pitch cylinders normal to the teeth, is called
a) normal pitch
b) axial pitch
c) diametral pitch
d) module
a
             Axial pitch is the distance, parallel to the axis, between similar faces of adjacent teeth.
3. In helical gears, the right hand helices on one gear will mesh ____________ helices on the other gear.
a) right hand
b) left hand
c) opposite
d) none of the mentioned
b
4. The helix angle for single helical gears ranges from
a) 10° to 15°
b) 15° to 20°
c) 20° to 35°
d) 35° to 50°
c
5. The helix angle for double helical gears may be made up to
a) 45°
b) 60°
c) 75°
d) 90°
a
6. The outside diameter of an involute gear is equal to pitch circle diameter plus
a) 2 addendum
b) 2 dedendum
c) 3.1416 module
d) 2.157 module
a
7. Pick out the false statement about relationships of spur gears.
a) Pitch diameter = module x No. of teeth
b) Module = 25.4/diametral pitch
c) dedendum = 1.25 x module
d) Base pitch = module x п x sinɸ
d
Base pitch = module x п x sinɸ
Correct relationship of base pitch = module x п x cosɸ
8. Which of the following is not the correct property of involute curve?
a) The form or shape pf an involute curve depends upon the diameter of base circle from which it is derived
b) The angular motion of two involute gear teeth rotating at a uniform rate will be uniform, irrespective of the centre distance
c) The relative rate of motion between driving and driven gears having involute tooth curves, is established by the diameters of their pitch circles
d) the pitch diameters of mating involute gears are directly proportional to the diameters of their respective base circles
c
9. Which of the following gear ratio does not result in hunting tool
a) 77/20
b) 76/21
c) 75/22
d) 71/25
d
10. In measuring the chordal thickness, the vertical scale of a gear tooth caliper is set to the chordal or corrected addendum to locate the caliper jaws at the pitch line.If a = addendum, t = circular thickness of tooth at pitch diameter D, then chordal thickness is equal to
a) a + t/D
b) a + t2/D
c) a + t3/2D
d) a + t2/4D
d
