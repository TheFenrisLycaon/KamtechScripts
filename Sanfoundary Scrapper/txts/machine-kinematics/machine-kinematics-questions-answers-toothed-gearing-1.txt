1. The two parallel and coplanar shafts are connected by gears having teeth parallel to the axis of the shaft. This arrangement is called
a) spur gearing
b) helical gearing
c) bevel gearing
d) spiral gearing
a
2. The type of gears used to connect two non-parallel non-intersecting shafts are
a) spur gears
b) helical gears
c) spiral gears
d) none of the mentioned
c
3. An imaginary circle which by pure rolling action, gives the same motion as the actual gear, is called
a) addendum circle
b) dedendum circle
c) pitch circle
d) clearance circle
c
             Addendum circle is the circle drawn through the top of the teeth and is concentric with the pitch circle.
             Dedendum circle is the circle drawn through the bottom of the teeth. It is also called root circle.
4. The size of a gear is usually specified by
a) pressure angle
b) circular pitch
c) diametral pitch
d) pitch circle diameter
d
5. The radial distance of a tooth from the pitch circle to the bottom of the tooth, is called
a) dedendum
b) addendum
c) clearance
d) working depth
a
             Dedendum is the radial distance of a tooth from the pitch circle to the bottom of the tooth.
6. The product of the diametral pitch and circular pitch is equal to
a) 1
b) 1/π
c) π
d) 2π
c
 where, pc = circular pitch.
7. The module is the reciprocal of
a) diametral pitch
b) circular pitch
c) pitch diameter
d) none of the mentioned
a
It is usually denoted by m. Mathematically,
Module, m = D /T.
8. Which is the incorrect relationship of gears?
a) Circular pitch × Diametral pitch = π
b) Module = P.C.D/No.of teeth
c) Dedendum = 1.157 module
d) Addendum = 2.157 module
d
9. If the module of a gear be m, the number of teeth T and pitch circle diameter D, then
a) m = D/T
b) D = T/m
c) m = D/2T
d) none of the mentioned
a
10. Mitre gears are used for
a) great speed reduction
b) equal speed
c) minimum axial thrust
d) minimum backlash
b
