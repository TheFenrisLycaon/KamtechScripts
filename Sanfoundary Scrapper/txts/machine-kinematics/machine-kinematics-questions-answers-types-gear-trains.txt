1. A fixed gear having 200 teeth is in mesh with another gear having 50 teeth. The two gears are connected by an arm. The number of turns made by the smaller gear for one revolution of arm about the centre of bigger gear is
a) 2
b) 4
c) 3
d) none of the mentioned
b
             N2 = 50
Number of turns = N1/N2
                = 200/50 = 4.
2. Number of teeth on a wheel per unit of its pitch diameter is called
a) module
b) diametral pitch
c) circular pitch
d) none of the mentioned
b
3. The type of gears used to connect two non parallel and non intersecting shafts is
a) Spur gear
b) Helical gear
c) Bevel gear
d) Spiral gear
d
4. To connect two parallel and coplanar shafts the following type of gearing is used
a) Spur gear
b) Bevel gear
c) Spiral gear
d) None of the mentioned
a
5. In which of the following type of gear train the first gear and the last gear are co-axial.
a) Simple gear train
b) Compound gear train
c) Reverted gear train
d) None of the mentioned
c
6. Which gear train is used for higher velocity ratios in a small space?
a) Simple gear train
b) Compound gear train
c) Reverted gear train
d) Epicyclic gear train
d
7. Which type of gear train is used in clock mechanism to join hour hand and minute hand?
a) Simple gear train
b) Compound gear train
c) Reverted gear train
d) Epicyclic gear train
d
8. The gear used to convert rotary motion into translating motion is
a) Worm and wheel
b) Crown gear
c) Rack and pinion
d) Spiral Bevel gear
c
9. The circular pitch of a gear is given by
a) Πd/t
b) Πd/2t
c) 2Πd/t
d) Πd/3t
a
Pc = Πd/t
Where d=diameter of pitch circle
t=number of teeth.
10. In a simple gear train, if the number of idle gears is odd, then the motion of driven gear will
a) be opposite as that of driving gear
b) be same as that of driving gear
c) depend upon the number of teeth on the driving gear
d) none of the mentioned
b
