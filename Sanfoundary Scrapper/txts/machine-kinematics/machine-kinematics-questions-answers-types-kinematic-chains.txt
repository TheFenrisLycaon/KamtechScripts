1. Scotch yoke mechanism is used to generate
a) Sine functions
b) Square roots
c) logarithms
d) inversions
a
1. Fixed link
2. Crank
3. Sliding Block
4. Yoke.
2. Which of the following are inversions of a double slider crank chain?
1. Whitworth return motion        2. Scotch Yoke
3. Oldham’s Coupling              4. Rotary engine
Select correct answer using the codes given below:
Codes:
a) 1 and 2
b) 1, 3 and 4
c) 2 and 3
d) 2, 3 and 4
c
It has four binary links, two revolute pairs, two sliding pairs. Its various types are:
1. Scotch Yoke mechanism
2. Oldhams Coupling
3. Elliptical Trammel.
3. Oldham’s coupling is used to transmit power between two parallel shafts which are slightly offset.
a) True
b) false
a
4. In Oldham’s coupling the condition for maximum speed ratio is
a) w1cosα/W
b) w1sinα/W
c) w1/W = 1/cosα
d) w1/W = 1/sinα
c
For maximum speed ratio cos2ϴ = 1
Therefore, w1/W = 1/cosα.
5. The relative acceleration of two points which are at variable distance apart on a moving link can be determined by using the
a) three centers in line theorem
b) instantaneous centre of rotation method
c) Coriolis component of acceleration method
d) Klein’s construction
b
6. What is the number of instantaneous centres of rotation for a 6-link mechanism?
a) 4
b) 6
c) 12
d) 15
d
7. For one degree of freedom planer mechanism having links, which one of the following is the possible combination?
a) Four binary links and two ternary links
b) Four ternary links and two binary links
c) Three ternary links and three binary links
d) One ternary link and five binary links
d
or, j = 3/2l – 2 for six link
j = 3/2 x 6 – 2 = 7          1 ternary link = 2 binary link
a) j = 4 + 2 x 2 ≠ 7
b) j = 4 x 2 + 2 ≠ 7
c) j = 3 x 2 + 2 ≠ 7
d) j = 1 x 2 + 5 ≠ 7 the ans is d.
8. Inversion of a kinematic chain relative to some other links is a property of the chain and is not that of the mechanism.
a) True
b) False
a
9. In a shaping operation, the average cutting speed is ( Stroke length S, Number of strokes per minute N, Quick return ratio R)
a) NSR
b) NSR/2
c) NS(1 + R)
d) NS(1 + R)/2
d
Time for return stroke = Tr
R = Tr/Tf
Therefore, time for only one cutting stroke(T) = 1/N x Tf/(Tf + Tr)
Average cutting speed = S/T = SN(Tf + Tr)/Tf = SN(1 + R).
10. Ina kinematic inversion, the relative motions between links of the mechanism change as different links are made the frame by turns.
a) True
B) False
b
11. An elliptical trammel is a mechanism with three prismatic pairs and one revolute pair.
a) True
B) False
b
