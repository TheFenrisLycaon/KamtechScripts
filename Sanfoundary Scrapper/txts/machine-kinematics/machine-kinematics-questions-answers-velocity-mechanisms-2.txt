7. The fundamental equation for correct steering is
a) sinɸ + sinα  = b/c
b) cosɸ – sinα  = c/b
c) cotɸ – cotα  = c/b
d) tanɸ + cotα  = b/c
c
The fundamental equation for correct steering is
cotɸ – cotα  = c/b
where ɸ and α = Angle through which the axix of the outer wheel and inner wheel turns respectively
      c = Distance between the pivots of the front axles
      b = Wheel base.
8. The condition for correct steering of a Davis steering is
a) sinα  = b/c
b) cosα  = c/b
c) tanα  = c/2b
d) cotα  = c/2b
c
tanα  = c/2b
where  α = Angle of inclination of the links to the vertical. 
9. The driving and driven shafts connected by a Hooke’s joint will have equal speeds, if
a) cosϴ  = sinα
b) sinϴ  = √tanα
c) tanϴ  = √cosα
d) cotϴ  = cosα
c
tanϴ  = √cosα.
10. The Ackerman steering gear mechanism is preferred to the Davis steering gear mechanism because
a) whole of the mechanism in the Ackerman steering gear is on the back of the front wheels
b) the Ackerman steering gear consists of turning pairs
c) the Ackerman steering gear is most economical
