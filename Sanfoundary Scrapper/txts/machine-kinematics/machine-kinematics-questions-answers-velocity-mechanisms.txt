1. In the figure given below A and D are fixed points, link AB rotates at a uniform angular velocity of 900 rev/min ccw, find the instantaneous velocity of point E in m/s.
Rab = 100mm, Bc = 450, distance of E from BC = 100mm, Cf = 75mm, CD = 275mm, AD = 250mm, perpendicular DF = 17mm, perpendicular BE = 250mm.
a) 8.3
b) 8.7
c) 9
d) 7.6
a
first we find that
Vb = ωxRab = 9.42 m/s
Vcb = 11.42
Vcd = 13.61 m/s
constructing a velocity graph, we find that
Ve = 8.3m/s. 
2. Velocity of a point B in a link can be calculated by using the relation
Vb = Va – Vba.
a) True
b) False
b
Vb = Va + Vba.
3. In the figure given below A and D are fixed points, link AB rotates at a uniform angular velocity of 900 rev/min ccw, find instantaneous velocity of point F in m/s.
Rab = 100mm, Bc = 450, distance of E from BC = 100mm, Cf= 75mm, CD = 275mm, AD =250mm, perpendicular DF = 17mm, perpendicular BE = 250mm.
a) 8.3
b) 8.7
c) 9.4
d) 7.6
c
first we find that
Vb = ωxRab = 9.42 m/s
Vcb = 11.42
Vcd = 13.61 m/s
constructing a velocity graph, we find that
Vf = 9.4 m/s. 
4. In the figure given below A and D are fixed points, link AB rotates at a uniform angular velocity of 900 rev/min ccw, find angular velocity of BC in rad/s.
Rab = 100mm, Bc = 450, distance of E from BC = 100mm, Cf= 75mm, CD = 275mm, AD =250mm, perpendicular DF = 17mm, perpendicular BE = 250mm.
a) 28.3
b) 2 8.7
c) 29.4
d) 25.3
d
first we find that
Vb = ωxRab = 9.42 m/s
Vcb = 11.42
ωcb = Vcb/Rcb
= 25.37 rad/s.
5. In the figure given below A and D are fixed points, link AB rotates at a uniform angular velocity of 900 rev/min ccw, find angular velocity of CDin rad/s.
Rab = 100mm, Bc = 450, distance of E from BC = 100mm, Cf= 75mm, CD = 275mm, AD =250mm, perpendicular DF = 17mm, perpendicular BE = 250mm.
a) 48.37
b) 48.77
c) 49.47
d) 45.37
c
first we find that
Vb = ωxRab = 9.42 m/s
Vcd = 13.61 m/s
ωcd = Vcd/Rcd
= 49.47 rad/s.
