1. When bevel gears having equal teeth and equal pitch angles connect two shafts whose axes intersect at right angle, then they are known as
a) angular bevel gears
b) crown bevel gears
c) internal bevel gears
d) mitre gears
d
When the bevel gears connect two shafts whose axes intersect at an angle other than a right angle, then they are known as angular bevel gears.
2. The face angle of a bevel gear is equal to
a) pitch angle – addendum angle
b) pitch angle + addendum angle
c) pitch angle – dedendum angle
d) pitch angle + dedendum angle
b
3. The root angle of a bevel gear is equal to
a) pitch angle – addendum angle
b) pitch angle + addendum angle
c) pitch angle – dedendum angle
d) pitch angle + dedendum angle
c
4. If b denotes the face width and L denotes the cone distance, then the bevel factor is written as
a) b / L
b) b / 2L
c) 1 – 2 b.L
d) 1 – b / L
d
5. For a bevel gear having the pitch angle θ, the ratio of formative number of teeth (TE) to actual number of teeth (T) is
a) 1/sin θ
b) 1/cos θ
c) 1/tan θ
d) sin θ cos θ
b
6. The worm gears are widely used for transmitting power at ______________ velocity ratios between non-intersecting shafts.
a) high
b) low
c) medium
d) none of the mentioned
a
7. In worm gears, the angle between the tangent to the thread helix on the pitch cylinder and the plane normal to the axis of worm is called
a) pressure angle
b) lead angle
c) helix angle
d) friction angle
b
8. The normal lead, in a worm having multiple start threads, is given by
a) lN = l / cos λ
b) lN = l . cos λ
c) lN = l
d) lN = l tan
b
            lN = l . cos λ
where lN = Normal lead,
l = Lead, and
λ = Lead angle.
9. The number of starts on the worm for a velocity ratio of 40 should be
a) single
b) double
c) triple
d) quadruple
a
10. The axial thrust on the worm (WA) is given by
a) WA = WT . tan φ
b) WA = WT / tan φ
c) WA = WT . tan λ
d) WA = WT / tan λ
d
             WA = WT / tan λ = Tangential force on the worm gear
where WT = Tangential force acting on the worm,
φ = Pressure angle, and
λ = Lead angle.
