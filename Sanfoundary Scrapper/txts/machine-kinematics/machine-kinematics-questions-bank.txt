b) False
a
3. The ratio of the driving tensions for V-belts is _____________ times that of flat belts.
a) sin β
b) cos β
c) cosec β
d) sec β
c

a) True
b) False
a
5. Creep in belt drive is due to
a) weak material of the belt
b) weak material of the pulley

d) expansion of the belt
c
6. The centrifugal tension in belts
a) increases power transmitted
b) decreases power transmitted
c) have no effect on power transmitted
d) increases power transmitted upto a certain speed and then decreases
c
7. When the belt is stationary, it is subjected to some tension known as initial tension. The value of this tension is equal to the
a) tension in the tight side of the belt
b) tension in the slack side of the belt
c) sum of the tensions on the tight side and slack side of the belt
d) average tension of the tight side and slack side of the belt
d
8. A pulley is connected to a power transmission shaft of diameter d by means of a rectangular sunk key of width w and length l. The width of the key is taken as d/4. For full power transmission, the shearing strength of the key is equal to the torsional shearing strength of the shaft. The ratio of the length of the key to the diameter of the shaft (l/d) is
a) п/4
b) п/6
c) п/2
d) п
