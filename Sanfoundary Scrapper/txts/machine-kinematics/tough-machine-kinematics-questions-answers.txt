1. A single slider crank chain is a _______
a) 4-link mechanism
b) 3-link mechanism
c) 2-link mechanism
d) 6-link mechanism
a
2. Bull engine is an inversion of single slider crank chain.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Find the ratio of the time of cutting to the time of return stroke from the following information: A crank and slotted lever mechanism used in a shaper has a centre distance of 0.300 m between the centre of oscillation of the slotted lever and the centre of rotation of the crank. The radius of the crank is 0.120 m.
a) 1.72
b) 1.65
c) 1.81
d) 1.79
a
360-α/ α
Using trigonometric ratios we find that α =132.8°
therefore, Ratio = 1.72.
4. Find the inclination of the slotted bar with the vertical in degrees in the extreme position from the following information: In a crank and slotted lever quick return motion mechanism, the distance between the fixed centres is 0.240 m and the length of the driving crank is 0.120 m.
a) 30
b) 45
c) 60
d) 75
a
angle = 30 degrees. 
5. Find the ratio of the time of cutting to the time of return stroke from the following information: In a crank and slotted lever quick return motion mechanism, the distance between the fixed centres is 0.240 m and the length of the driving crank is 0.120 m.
a) 3
b) 4.5
c) 3.2
d) 2
d
angle = 30 degrees.
now 90- α/2 = 30
α=120 degrees
therefore ratio = 2.
6. Find the length of stroke if the length of the slotted bar is 0.45m and LOS passes through the free end of the lever. Length of driving crank = 0.12m, distance between fixe centres = 0.24m. Crank and slotted lever quick return motion mechanism.
a) 450mm
b) 400mm
c) 500mm
d) 475mm
a
2x450xsin(90-α/2)
α=120 degrees,
therefore
length = 450mm.
7. Which of the following mechanism is mostly used in shaping and slotting machines?
a) Whitworth quick return motion mechanism
b) Bull engine
c) Crank and slotted lever quick return motion mechanism
d) Gnome engine
a
8. In Whitworth quick return motion mechanism, the driving crank is under an accelerated motion
a) True
b) False
b
9. Which of the following mechanism is used to convert reciprocating motion into rotary motion?
a) Whitworth quick return motion mechanism
b) Oscillating cylinder engine
c) Crank and slotted lever quick return motion mechanism
d) Gnome engine
a
10. How many cylinders are there in Gnome engine?
a) 4
b) 5
c) 6
d) 7
d
