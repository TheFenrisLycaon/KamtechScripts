6. The feed may be expressed in______
a) mm/revolution
b) mm*revolution
c) mm
d) none of the mentioned
a
7. ______ is equal to half the diameter of the drill used.
a) feed
b) depth of cut
c) machining time
d) none of the mentioned
b
8. Depth of cut can be expressed in______
a) mm
b) mm/revolution
c) mm/minute
d) none of the mentioned
a
9. The formula for depth of cut is______
d=diameter of the drill.
a) d/4
b) d/2
c) d
d) 2d
b
10. If s2=feed per revolution, s1=feed per minute, n=rpm.
Which of the following is mathematically right?
a) s1=s2*n
b) s2=s1*n
c) s1*s2=n
d) none of the mentioned
a
11. Machining time is expressed in______
a) mm/minute
b) minute*minute
c) minute
d) none of the mentioned
c
12. If l=length of travel of the drill in mm, n=rpm of the drill, s= feed per revolution of the drill in mm. Then machining time can be given as_____
a) (l*n)/s
b) (l*s)/n
c) l/(n*s)
d) none of the mentioned
c
13. Metal removal rate can be given as_____
a) (mm*mm*mm)/min
b) (mm*mm*m)/revolution
c) mm/revolution
d) mm/minute
a
Metal removal rate = area of metal removed*rpm*feed/revolution and it equal to (3.14*d^2/4)*n*feed/revolution. From this, we can easily derive the expression.
