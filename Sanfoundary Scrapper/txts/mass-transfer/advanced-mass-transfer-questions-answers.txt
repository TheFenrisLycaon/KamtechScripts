1. Stages in the extractor are _______________
a) Equilibrium stages
b) Theoretical stages
c) Equilibrium or theoretical stages
d) None of the mentioned
c
2. Extraction includes mixing alone.
a) True
b) False
b
3. Every stage of extractor act as mixer and settler in the extraction process.
a) True
b) False
a
4. If the pure solvent is used find the value of “ys” by analysing the below single stage extractor.
Where, F,S are feed and solvent
a) 0
b) 1
c) 0-1
d) None of the mentioned
a
5. Find the rate of extract in mol/hr if
Rate(mol/hr)
Composition
Feed
100
0.5
Solvent
50
0
Residue
25
0.25
a) 100
b) 125
c) 150
d) 50
b
 100+50-25 = 125 mol/hr.
6. Is the extraction is possible if a gas solvent is used for extracting solute from liquid mixture.
a) True
b) False
b
7. Find the process.
a) Single stage batch process
b) Single stage continuous process
c) Multistage continuous process
d) None of the mentioned
b
8. Find the sum of R and E if the sum of F and S is 80 kmol.
a) 20 kmol
b) 40 kmol
c) 60 kmol
d) 80 kmol
d
9. Find the pure solvent rate if the feed ( F= 100 kmol/hr) composition is 0.65 and mixture solute composition is 0.5.
a) 10 kmol/hr
b) 20 kmol/hr
c) 30 kmol/hr
d) 40 kmol/hr
c
                             = 0.3
                            = 100 x 0.3 = 30 kmol/hr.
10. Find the mixture composition of feed and pure solvent if the ratio of solvent to feed rate is 0.5 and the feed composition is 0.5.
a) 0.5
b) 0.25
c) 0.33
d) 0.4
c
                        0.5x+x = 0.5  then x= 0.33.
