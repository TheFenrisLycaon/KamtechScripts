1. For extraction, the distribution co-efficient should be greater that 1.
a) True
b) False
a
2. The viscosity should be high for the solvents using in extraction operation.
a) True
b) False
b
3. The Azeotropic composition of the solute makes the extraction process economical.
a) True
b) False
b
4. Find the separation factor if the ratio of weight fraction of solute in the extract to raffinate is 0.75. Also given the ratio of dilutant in raffinate to extract is 0.5.
a) 1
b) 1.25
c) 1.5
d) 1.75
c
                         =0.75/0.5 = 1.5.
5. The separation is possible if the ratio of weight fraction of solute in extract to raffinate is 0.15. Also given the ratio of dilutant in raffinate to extract is 0.5.
a) True
b) False
b
= 0.15/0.5 = 0.3 < 1 (Separation is not possible)
