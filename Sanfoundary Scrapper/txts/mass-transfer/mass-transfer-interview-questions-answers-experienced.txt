1. Spray tower is a _______ process.
a) Co-current
b) Counter current
c) Continuous
d) Batch
b
2. Find the rate of non-diffusing solute, if the mole fraction of the gas phase is 0.65 and the diffusing rate is 70 moles/hr.
a) 2 4.5 moles/hr
b) 200 moles/hr
c) 18.18 moles/hr
d) 37.7 moles/hr
a
               =70 x(1-0.65)
               =24.5 moles/hr.
3. In an absorber, lower denser materials are sent through the bottom and the higher denser materials are sent through top
a) True
b) False
a
4. Stripper= (1/X)
Find X?
a) Condenser
b) Reboiler
c) Absorber
d) Sprayer
c
5. Find the representation
Where, Y- gas phase concentration in mole ratio
       X-liquid phase concentration in mole ratio
a) Stripper
b) Absorber
c) Condenser
d) Semi-Stripper
a
6. Find the slope of the operating line
Here, the concentrations are represented in mole ratio. The value of (Y1-Y2)/(X1-X2) =2. Find the slope of the operating line.
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) Infinity
b
Ls/Gs= slope of the operating line = 2.
7. Have a look on the below diagram
 Here, DE and DP are the operating line. Also Y and X are the concentrations in mole ratio for gas and liquid phase.
It’s clearly a representation of an absorber. For the operating line DE minimum liquid is required
a) True
b) False
b
8. If the operating line touches the equilibrium line, the separation is possible in an absorber.
a) True
b) False
b
9. For the Absorber design, the plotting with mole ratio helps to find the
a) Slope of operating line
b) Slope of equilibrium curve
c) Minimum number of trays
d) Maximum number of trays
a
10. Given for an absorber, the minimum non diffusing liquid flow rate is 20 moles/hr and the non diffusing gas flow rate is 30 moles/hr. As the actual liquid flow rate is 2.5 times the minimum. Find the slope of the operating line.
a) 1.67
b) 3.75
c) 2.67
d) 4.25
a
          Slope= (2.5 x 20)/30 =1.67.
