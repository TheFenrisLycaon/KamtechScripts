1. Relation between the slope of two operating line in the give figure.
a) Equal
b) Un equal
c) 1>2
d) 2>1
a
2. Only small equipments are required for co-current process.
a) True
b) False
b
3. Find the concentration representation in the equilibrium distribution curve given below.
a) Mole ratio
b) Mass ratio
c) Mole fraction
d) None of the mentioned
c
4. Find the slope of the operating line from the figure below.
   If, Ls,Gs- non diffusing solvent
   X,Y- Concentrations in mole ratio
   x,y- concentration in mole fraction
a) Ls/Gs
b) –Ls/Gs
c) Gs/Ls
d) –Gs/Ls
a
                         Y1-Y2= Ls/Gs(X1-X2)
So the slope of the operating line is Ls/Gs. 
5. Find the driving force at the point (P) in the equilibrium distribution curve given below.
a) Zero
b) Infinity
c) One
d) Greater than one
a
6. The driving force line between the operating line and the equilibrium line depends on
a) Relative diffusion resistance
b) Relative mass resistance
c) Cumulative resistance
d) None of the mentioned
a
7. Removal of ammonia from the air with water is an example of a counter-current process.
a) True
b) False
a
8. For Air-Water system Lewis Number equals to
a) Approx 1
b) 0
c) Infinity
d) 0 to 1
a
