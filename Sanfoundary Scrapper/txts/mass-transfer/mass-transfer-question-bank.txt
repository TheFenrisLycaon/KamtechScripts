1. The Ponchon Savorit method is applicable for determining negligible heat loss.
a) True
b) False
a
2. External reflux ratio is used for Ponchon Savorit method.
a) True
b) False
b
3. Find the heat removed by the condenser if the net heat out of the condenser is 25000 J and the total moles are 25.
a) 1000 J
b) 10000 J
c) 5000 J
d) 2000 J
a
                                           = 25000 J/ 25
                                           = 1000.
4. From the enthalpy-concentration diagram find the location of heat removed by the condenser.
a) X
b) Y
c) Z
d) None of the mentioned
a
5. Find the internal reflux ratio by analysing the below fractionator.
a) 0.8
b) 1.25
c) 1.2
d) 1
b
6. Estimate the heat removed by the condenser.
a) 20 KJ/Kg
b) 22 KJ/Kg
c) 24 KJ/Kg
d) 0
b
7. Find the distillate rate by analysing the fractionator given below.
a) 10 KJ
b) 20 KJ
c) 30 KJ
d) 40 KJ
c
                       L*HL + G* Hg = DQ
                       Q=(50*20 + 40*10)/20 = 30 KJ.
8. The fictitious stream is the difference in the flow rates of the nth tray.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Ponchon Savorit method do not include enthalpy concentration diagram.
a) True
b) False
b
10. Find the flow rate of liquid entering into the enriching section if the internal reflux ratio is 1.5 times min. Given minimum reflux ratio is 0.95 and the gas flow rate is 35 mol/hr.
a) 49.87 mol/hr
b) 22.167 mol/hr
c) 55.26 mol/hr
d) None of the mentioned
a
                         1.5 *0.95 = L/35
                                  L= 49.87 mol/hr.
