6. Find the number of stage(s)
 Where,
                Y- Mole Ratio of gas phase
                X- Mole Ratio of liquid phase
a) 1
b) 2
c) 1 to 2
d) No stage
a
7. Murphree efficiency is defined as the number of equilibrium stages to the number of real stages.
a) True
b) False
b
8.  Find the value of y in an ideal single stage absorber is used to remove ammonia from gas with water as solvent. Its representation is given below
Here,
     y0=0.2, the molar gas flow rates of liquid and gas mixture in (moles/sec) are 4 and 2. The equilibrium relation between y and x is given by y = 0.2x. The solvent water is pure.
a) 1/10
b) 1/20
c) 2/110
d) 2/220
b
      2 (0.2) + 4(0) = 2 (y*) + 4(x)
      As y= 0.2x
      0.4= 0.4x + 4x
      x= (1/11)
      y= 2/110.
9.  ______________ is defined as the number of equilibrium stages to the number of real stages.
a) Murphree stage efficiency
b) Fractional overall efficiency
c) Stage efficiency
d) Overall efficiency
b
10. Find the Murphree stage efficiency for the following co-current operation with equilibrium leaving gas phase concentration Y*= 0.8.
Where,
     G and L are gas and liquid flow rates
     Y and X are concentration in mole ratio (Y1=0.2, Y2=0.4, X1= 0.6, X2=0.8)
a) 25%
b) 50%
c) 75%
d) 100%
a
Given gas phase leaving stream in equilibrium Y2*= 0.8
Then, Murphree stage efficiency is (0.2/0.8) x 100
Murphree stage efficiency is 25%.
