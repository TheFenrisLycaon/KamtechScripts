2. In order to prepare Lithium nitride, air is passed gently over a reactor. Suppose that Nitrogen diffuse to a length 5cm before getting reacted with Lithium. Nitrogen reacts with lithium quickly so that partial pressure of Nitrogen at that point is 0. Reactor is a cylinder of length 10cm and diameter 2cm. Assume air to be a mixture of Nitrogen and Oxygen only. The temperature is 298K and total pressure 1atm. Diffusivity of N2 in O2 is 2*10-5m2/s. Calculate the Molar flux (mol/m2.s) of N2 at a distance of 2.5cm from the top with respect to an observer moving with twice the mass average velocity a direction towards the liquid surface. (R=8.205*10-5m3atmK-1mol-1). Assume z=0 at the top of the reactor.

                           Case: Diffusion of A through non-diffusing B
                           N2 in air= 79%
                           O2 in air= 21%
              Molar flux of N2, NA=0.025mol/m2.s
             Pressure of N2 at the point z=2.5cm=
(  DAB*P ln⁡[(P-P5)/(P-P0)])/RTl=(DAB*P ln⁡[(P-P5)/(P-P2.5)])/RTl
P2.5=0.542atm
Velocity of N2= NART/P2.5=112.78*10-5m/s
Molar flux of O2-=0
Velocity of O2=0
Average molar mass=0.542*28+0.458*32=29.832
Mass average velocity= (0.542*28*112.78*10-5)/29.832=57.37*10-5m/s
Required molar flux at the distance of z=5, is
                                               CA(uA-2V)= NA-2PAV/RT=4.242*10-4mol/m2.s.

                NA=DP/RTZ*ln⁡[(P-P1)/(P-P2)]
                                     NA=(2.567*10-5*1.013)/(0.08317*298.2*2.5*10-3)*ln⁡[(1.013-0.02244)/(1.013-0.02718)] = 2.01*10-6 kmol/m2.s=9.259*10-5kg/m2.s
                                 Amount of ethanol = 2*10-3*1=0.002m3=1.578kg
                               Time for evaporation= 1.578/9.259*10-5=17042.87s=4.73h.
