1. Partial pressure equals vapour pressure if it is___________
a) Saturated
b) Unsaturated
c) Isothermal
d) None of the mentioned
a
2. Say True or False
I) Vapour- at superheated temperature
II) Gas – at condensation temperature
a) True
b) False
b
3. Guess the saturated molar absolute humidity of the gas(A.- Vapour(B. mixture at 100 degree Celsius. Vapour pressure of A is 300 mmHg and the total pressure is 760 mmHg.
a) 0.39
b) 0.65
c) 0.60
d) Cannot determine
b
                                                                     = 300/(760-300) =0.65.
4. The system is unsaturated if partial pressure _________ equilibrium vapour pressure.
a) Less than
b) Greater than
c) Equals to
d) All of the mentioned
a
5. Consider a saturated gas(A.-vapour(B. mixture , if the absolute molal humidity is 0.265 and the total pressure= 760 mmHg. Find the vapour pressure of B.
a) 149.21 mmHg
b) 159.21 mmHg
c) 169.21 mmHg
d) 600.8 mmHg
d
 0.265= pA/760-pA
pA= 159.21
pB=760-159.21= 600.8.
6. The vapour pressure of the nitrogen gas is 400mmHg and the partial pressure is 300mmHg. Find the relative saturation.
a) 75
b) 133
c) 100
d) 50
a
                                                      =75.
7. Thermometer measurement temperature is
a) Dry bulb temperature
b) Wet bulb temperature
c) Dew point temperature
d) Room temperature
a
8. Find the dew point
a) X
b) Y
c) Z
d) None of the mentioned
a
9. Temperature at which the partial pressure of the gas-vapour mixture equals vapour pressure _______
a) Dry bulb temperature
b) Wet bulb temperature
c) Dew point temperature
d) None of the mentioned
c
10. Check whether we get approximately 80% saturation if the total pressure and the partial pressure of the gas mixture is 760 mmHg and 260 mmHg. Also, the vapour pressure is 300 mmHg.
a) True
b) False
a
%saturation= 0.52/0.652= 79.8(Approximately 80.
