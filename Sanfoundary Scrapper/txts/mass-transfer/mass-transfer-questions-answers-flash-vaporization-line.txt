1. At what feed condition the slope of q line is infinity?
a) Saturated vapour
b) Saturated liquid
c) Superheated vapour
d) None of the mentioned
b
2. Find the feed condition from the below distribution curve.
a) Saturated vapour
b) Saturated liquid
c) Superheated vapour
d) None of the mentioned
c
3. In an operation the slope of the q-line is found to be 0; then the enthalpy of feed equals enthalpy of _____________
