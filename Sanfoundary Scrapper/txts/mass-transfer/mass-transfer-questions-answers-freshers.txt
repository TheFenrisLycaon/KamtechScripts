1. In a certain process, there is a variation in the driving force between the phases, such a process is
a) Batch process
b) Semi-batch process
c) Continuous process
d) Isothermal process
a
2. Look out the figure below
At the position (X), which of the following will be remains same as it enters into the process.
a) Non-diffusing solvent
b) Non-diffusing solute
c) Diffusing solvent
d) Diffusing solute
a
3. Find the operating line slope
Where,  X,Y- concentration in mole ratio of liquid and gas phase
        x,y-concentration in mole fraction
         Gs,Ls- mole free basis( non-diffusing solvent)
a) Ls/Gs
b) –Ls/Gs
c) Gs/Ls
d) –Gs/Ls
b
          Gs(Y1)+Ls(X1)= Gs(Y2)+Ls(X2)
          Gs(Y1-Y2)= Ls(X2-X1)
          Y2-Y1= -Ls/Gs(X2-X1)
Slope of the operating line is –Ls/Gs.
4. In a concurrent process, the entering and leaving stream of the liquid phase concentrations in terms mole ratio is 0.25 and 0.45 also the entering and leaving stream concentration of the gas phase in terms mole ratio is 0.4 and 0.6
Find the slope of the operating line.
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
a
                  = 1.
5. Assume an ideal solution with pure component A, has a vapour pressure of 300 mmHg and the total pressure of 1atm. The concentration in terms of mole ratio is
a) 0.65
b) 0.28
c) 0.39
d) None of the mentioned
a
Total pressure= concentration x vapour pressure
Concentration in mole fraction=300/760 =0.39
Concentration in mole ratio = 0.39/(1-0.39)=0.65. 
6. The figure given below is a single stage ideal co- current process of solute transfer from liquid to gas phases.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Find the abscissa and ordinates of the graph
If X,Y –Concentration in mole ratio
x,y- Concentration in mole fraction
a) X,y
b) X,Y
c) x,y
d) x,Y
c
8. The operating line will be straight if its concentrations are represented in mole ratio.
a) True
b) False
a
9. If the whole liquid and gas flow rates are same, we can use the mole fraction for getting a straight operating line
a) True
b) False
a
10. Name of the line PR and QT
 If X, Y – are represented in mole ratio
a) Interface line
b) Driving force line
c) Parallel line
d) Normal line
b
