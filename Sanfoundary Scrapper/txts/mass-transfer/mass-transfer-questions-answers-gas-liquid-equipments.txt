1. For the multistage counter current gas dispersed operation, which of the following equipment is better?
a) Agitated vessel
b) Sparged vessel
c) Tray tower
d) Wetted wall column
b
2. During gas dispersion, if a chemical reaction between gas and liquid phase is needed, then the preferred equipment is
a) Agitated vessel
b) Sparged vessel
c) Tray tower
d) Wetted wall column
a
3. The fraction of volume occupied by the gas-liquid mixture in the equipment/vessel to the volume occupied by the gas is
a) Liquid holdup
b) Gas holdup
c) Gas-liquid holdup
d) None of the mentioned
b
4. In a Sparged vessel of area 50 cm, the flow rate of the gas is 2 cubic meters per second then the value of superficial gas velocity in meters per second is
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
d
 Superficial gas velocity= (2/0.5) =4.
5. In sparged vessel of area 50 cm and a gas holdup of 3 cubic meters per cubic meters, the flow rate of the gas is 5 cubic meters per second. The value of true gas velocity in meters per second is
a) 1.11
b) 2.22
c) 3.33
d) 4.44
c
             True gas velocity = Superficial velocity/ gas hold up
                               =10/3 = 3.33.
6. Guess the diameter of the bubble for an air-water system in a sparged vessel with gas holdup of 0.1 and liquid flow rate of 0.15 meters per second.
a) 7.786 x10-3
b) 7.786 x10-4
c) 9.832 x10-3
d) 9.832 x10-4
a
The relative velocity of the liquid upward= liquid flow rate/ (1- gas holdup)
Relative velocity = 0.15/0.9
Diameter = 7.786 x10-3.
7. In a Bubble column, if the velocity of the gas is low, then the bubble diameter is equals to______
a) Vessel
b) Sparger orifice
c) Volume of vessel/ interfacial area
d) None of the mentioned
b
8. If the relative velocity of the gas and liquid inside the bubble column of cross sectional area 0.2 meters with gas holdup of 0.736 is 3.6 meters square per second. The expected slip velocity is
a) 3.6 m/s
b) 4.89 m/s
c) 7.2 m/s
d) 9.78 m/s
a
9. Guess the interfacial area of a bubble with a gas volume of 2.5 x10^-3 cubic meters and diameter of 0.125 cm.
a) 2 sq.m
b) 4 sq.m
c) 6 sq.m
d) 12 sq.m
d
Interfacial area= (6 x 2.5 x10^-3)/ 0.00125= 12 sq.m
10. Find the process where an agitated vessel is required.
a) Vegetable oil hydrogenation
b) Production of penicillin
c) Paper stock chlorination
d) All of the mentioned
d
11. For a better stage efficiency, must have large interfacial surface and low mass transfer co-efficient.
a) True
b) False
b
12. The higher difference in pressure inside the tray tower cause
a) Flooding
b) Loading
c) Weeping
d) Dumping
a
