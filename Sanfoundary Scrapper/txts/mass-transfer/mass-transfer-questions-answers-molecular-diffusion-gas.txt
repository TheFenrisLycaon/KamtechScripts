1. __________ energy helps for molecular diffusion.
a) Thermal
b) Electrical
c) Internal
d) All of the mentioned
a
2. For two particles at steady state collision of A and B, J flux of A is 2 mol/sq.m sec find the J flux of B.
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) None of the mentioned
d
3. Estimate the mole fraction if concentration of A is 2 mol/cu.m and the total concentration is 5 mol/cu.m.
a) 0.2
b) 0.25
c) 0.4
d) 1
c
4. Find the partial pressure of A if the total pressure is 2 atm; Concentration of A is 2 mol/cu.m and total concentration is 5 mol/cu.m.
a) 0.2 atm
b) 0.4 atm
c) 0.6 atm
d) 0.8 atm
d
                   pA = 0.4 x 2 = 0.8 atm.
5. From the reaction, Methane –> Carbon + 2(Hydrogen molecule)  find the ratio of N  Flux of A to the Total N flux( A+B); Given N Flux of B =-2 N flux of A.
a) 1
b) -1
c) 2
d) -2
b
6. For a Steady state diffusion of A through Non- diffusing B. N flux of B= ______
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) Infinity
a
7. The value of N flux of A under steady state non-diffusing B with diffusing A is _________
a) 0
b) Constant
c) Infinity
d) None of the mentioned
b
8. If the value of N flux of A to the total N flux is 1 then it is a steady state diffusion of non-diffusing B.
a) True
b) False
a
             For N flux of B = 0 then N flux of A/N flux of A = 1.
