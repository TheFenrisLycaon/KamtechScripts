1. Find the operation where diffusion of solids not occurs
a) Adsorption
b) Leaching
c) Drying
d) Distillation
d
2. Find the diffusivity through slab if N flux of A 4 mol/sq.m sec, concentration difference is 2mol/cu.m and distance is 3 m.
a) 2 sq.m/s
b) 4 sq.m/s
c) 6 sq.m/s
d) 8 sq.m/s
c
                              D(AB) = 6 sq.m/sec.
3. Find the activated diffusivity of carbon if energy of activation is 6 kJ; the value of constant diffusivity is 2.5 sq.m/sec.  (Hint: the value of exponential of (-6/RT) is 2.55)
a) 6.375 sq.m/s
b) 1.02  sq.m/s
c) 15.3 sq.m/s
d) 16.25 sq.m/s
a
                                                             = 2.5 * 2.55
                                                             = 6.375.
