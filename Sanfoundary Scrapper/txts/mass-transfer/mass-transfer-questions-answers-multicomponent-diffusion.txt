Paragraph for question numbers (3-5)
A mixture of 60% hydrogen and 40% oxygen is blowing over a pan of water at 1atm pressure. The bulk gas temperature is 30°c and the water temperature is 20°C. The vapor pressure of water at this temperature is 17.53mm Hg. The concentration of moisture in the bulk gas is negligible and the diffusivity values are DO2-H2O=0.357cm2/s,DH2-H2O=0.972cm2/s at 34°C and DH2-O2=0.891cm2/s at 43°C.

a) Water vapor diffuses through non-diffusing hydrogen and oxygen
b) Hydrogen and Oxygen is diffusing through water vapor
c) Hydrogen is diffusing through water vapor and oxygen
d) None of Hydrogen, Oxygen and water vapor is diffusing
