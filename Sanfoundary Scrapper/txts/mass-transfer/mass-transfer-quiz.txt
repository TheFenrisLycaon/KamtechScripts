b) False
b
2. Consider a sugar solution[ Sugar + Water]; On  vaporization water only evaporate since sugar is________
a) Volatile
b) Non-Volatile
c) Cryogenic
d) None of the mentioned
b
3. Distillation is possible only if the solution components are_____________
a) Volatile
b) Non-volatile
c) Cryogenic
d) None of the mentioned
a
4. No further process required for _____________
a) Absorption
b) Extraction
c) Distillation
d) All of the mentioned
c
5. Look out the distribution curve, if the line PM is lesser than shown the separation is more
 Where, x,y are the concentrations in mole fractions
a) True
b) False
a
6. In a solution (A and B); The vapour pressure of A is 260 mmHg and B is 360 mmHg; Find the relative volatility?
a) 0.72
b) 1.38
c) 2
d) None of the mentioned
a
                                                     = 260/360
                                                    =0.72.
7. If the gas phase composition of a component A is 0.65 and its relative volatility is 2. Find the liquid phase composition.
a) 0.48
b) 0.58
c) 0.68
d) 0.78
a
                                 2= 1.85 * (1-x)/x ; x= 0.48.
8. The component A and B has the same boiling point. Can the separation is done by ordinary separation?
a) True
b) False
b
9. Find the relative volatility, if x, y are the concentrations in mole fraction.
a) 6.92
b) 0.14
c) 1.88
d) None of the mentioned
a
10. The possibility of separation will be more if the separation factor is greater than 1.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Find the vapour pressure of component A in an ideal mixture, if its liquid composition and the partial pressure is 0.65 and 260 mmHg.
a) 260 mmHg
b) 400 mmHg
c) 760 mmHg
d) Cannot determine
b
Vapour pressure= (260/0.65)=400 mmHg.
12. Consider an ideal vapour-liquid binary mixture, find the total pressure if the vapour pressure of A is 260 mmHg and the vapour pressure of B is 520 mmHg and the composition of A in mole fraction is 0.55.
a) 177 mmHg
b) 277 mmHg
c) 377 mmHg
d) 477 mmHg
c
13. Guess the exact relation between the vapour phase mole fraction and relative volatility.
a) y= A*x/(1+x(A+1))
b) y= A*x/(1-x(A-1))
c) y= A*x/(1+x(A-1))
d) y= A*x/(1-x(A+1))
c
On rearranging, y= A*x/(1+x(A-1).
where, A – relative volatility.
