1. Find the time taken to dry 50% to 40% of moisture (dry basis) if critical moisture content is 30%. If the weight of the wet solid is 5 kg and the product of area and the constant rate is 0.5 kg/min.
a) 20 sec
b) 40 sec
c) 60 sec
d) 80 sec
c
                                                   = (5 * 0.1/0.5) min = 1 min = 60 sec.

a) Constant rate period
b) Falling rate period
c) Unsaturated period
d) None of the mentioned
