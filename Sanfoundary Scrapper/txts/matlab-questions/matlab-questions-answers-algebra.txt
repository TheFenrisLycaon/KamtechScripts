3. In the function vpa(‘981’,10), why do we put 981 within inverted commas?
a) We can choose to not put the value within a pair of single inverted comma
b) We do it so that we don’t get an approximated value
c) We do it to get the exact value as MATLAB computes exact values, of numerical expressions, when declared within a string
d) We do it to get a floating-point approximated value, approximated to 14 digits
c
