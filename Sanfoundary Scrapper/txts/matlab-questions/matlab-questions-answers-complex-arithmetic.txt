1. Which command is used to find the argument of a complex number?
a) atan2()
b) args()
c) abs()
d) cannot be determined
a
2. What is the class of the complex number?
a) double
b) symbolic
c) character
d) array
b
3. What is the argument of -1-i in MATLAB?
a) -3*pi/4
b) pi/4
c) 5*pi/4
d) -7*pi/4
a
4. What will be the output of the following code?
atan2(-1,1)
a) Error
b) -pi/4
c) -.7854
d) 0
c
5. The modulus of z, z conjugate and -z are not equal in MATLAB.
a) True
b) False
b
6. What will be the output of the following code?
z=2+3i/(i99)
a) z conjugate
b) -z
c) -3+(2*i)
d) -1
d
2+3i/(i99)=2-3=-1. If we had given 2+3i within brackets, the value would have been -3+(2*i). The answer won’t be -z or z conjugate.
7. What is the output of the following code?
t=-i:.01*i:i; p=exp(2*t);plot(t,p)
a) a sinusoidal signal
b) an exponential signal
c) a discrete sinusoidal
d) no plot
d
8. What is the command used to check the real part of a complex number in MATLAB?
a) abs()
b) realc()
c) real()
d) cannot be checked
c
9. Which of the following command can be is used for complex arithmetic?
a) abs()
b) atan()
c) realc()
d) imagc()
a
10. What will be the output of the following code?
abs(i)
a) 1
b) -1
c) Error
d) i
a
Output: 1
