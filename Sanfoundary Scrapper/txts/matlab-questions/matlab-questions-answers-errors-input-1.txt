               To compute element wise POWER, use POWER (.^) instead.
3. What is the output of the following code?
Join [email protected]
A=[1 1; 1 1]; A^2
a) 
A = 2 2
    2 2
b) 
A = 1 1
    1 1
c) Error using  ^  To compute element wise POWER, use POWER (.^) instead
d) No output
a
Output: Cursor shifts to the next line, waiting for a new line of code.
4. What is the output of the following code?
A=[1 2]; B=[1 4]; c=A*B;
a) c= [1 8] 
b) 
c = 1
    8
c) Inner Matrix dimensions must agree
d) No output since we have closed the line of code with a semicolon
c
5. What is the output of the following line of code?
			t=0:pi/8:4pi;
a) No output as we’ve closed the line of code with a semi-colon
b) 
1      2        3        4        5        6        7       8        9
0    1.5708   3.1416   4.7124   6.2832   7.8540   9.4248  10.9956  12.5664
c) Error: Unexpected MATLAB expression
d) Undefined function or variable ‘pi’
c
6. What is the error in the code?
a=[[1;2];(2,3)]
a) Third brackets are wrong
b) The semicolon within the second third brackets
c) There is no error
d) Error: Expression or statement is incorrect–possibly unbalanced
d
7. What is the output in the following code?
a=[[1;22],[53;9],[13;2]];
a) There is no output
b) Columns are to be introduced by placing semi-columns
c) Dimensions of matrices being concatenated are not consistent
d) 
a = 1    53    13
   22     9     2
a
a = 1    53    13
   22     9     2
   There is no error and there will be no output since the dimensions of matrices being concatenated are constant.
  
8. What is the difference between the two codes?
a> P=[91,’pi’];
b> Q=[91,pi];
a) Code a initialises P as a character array while code b initialises Q as an integer array
b) Both P and Q will be integer arrays
c) Code b initialises P as a character array while code a initialises Q as an integer array
d) Both P and Q will be character arrays
a
Output: 
For a>   P= [pi
    b>   Q= 91  3.1416
