1. How many expressions are there in the following mathematical relation?
 a=sqrt(log(sqrt(x+y)))
a) 2
b) 3
c) 1
d) 4
b
2. How many functions are there in the following mathematical relation?
	p=sin(pi*(log(x))
a) 2
b) 3
c) 1
d) 0
a
3. What are the minimum numbers of expressions which will be required to express a mathematical relation?
a) At least 1
b) At least 2
c) At most 1
d) Depends on the number of variables
d
	y=func(x1,x2,x3…xn)
This contains two expressions only. The function, ‘func’, may contain a set of 10000 statements. But we have simplified the expression to demonstrate a mathematical relation between y and all the other variables of the right-hand side, provided we are sure about the nature of the function ‘func’.
4. Is it possible to reduce the number of expressions in the following mathematical relation?
a=sin(pi*log(x))
a) Yes
b) No
c) Maybe
d) Impossible
a
	a=func(x)
We have 2 expressions now while the previous statement had 4 expressions. Hence, we have reduced the number of expressions.
5. Is it possible to reduce the number of functions in the following mathematical relation?
	l=cos(2*pi*sin(n/x))
a) Yes
b) No
c) Maybe
d) Obviously
b
6. The teacher has given the assignment to find the sum of 2 numbers. But the code should not contain the ‘+’ operator. What is to be done?
a) Use a function
b) Add the values and print the sum directly
c) Use an expression
d) Cannot be done
a
7. How many expressions are used to describe a mathematical relation between a, b and c?
b=9; c=4;
a=b+c;
a) 4
b) 2
c) 3
d) 1
b
8. A mathematical statement is a combination of functions and variables only.
a) True
b) False
b
9. What is the command which can be used to see the expressions within a user-defined function in MATLAB?
a) help
b) look for
c) echo on
d) cannot be seen
c
10. What are mathematical expressions?
a) Any mathematical relation
b) Any mathematical operation
c) Any mathematical conversation
d) Any mathematical function
b
