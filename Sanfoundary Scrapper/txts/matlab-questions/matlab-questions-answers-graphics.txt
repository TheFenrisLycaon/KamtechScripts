c) plot() & disc()
d) cont() & stem()
a
2. Find the error in the following code.

a) Plot is not available in MATLAB
b) Syntax of plot is wrong
c) Length of x and y should be same
d) No error
c
3. What is the output in the following code?
x=-10:1:10; y=-10:1:10;axis(‘off’); plot(x,y)
a) Error
b) A graph will be shown without axes
c) A graph will be shown with axes

4. If we want to plot matrix arguments, which of the following gets plotted?
a) Column wise inter-relation of two arguments
b) Row wise inter-relation of two arguments
c) Diagonally inter-relation of two arguments

a
So, if x=[x1 x2 x3];y=[y1 y2 y3]; plot(x,y)- MATLAB will generate a plot between (x1,y1),(x2,y2) and so on.
