d
Output: 

Name     Size            Bytes    Class     Attributes
  a       1x1              8      double              
  b       1x1              8  	  double              
  c       1x2              4      char   
 
7. From the following desktop view of workspace, choose the correct code.
a) a=10;b=’pi’;syms c; d=[1,2;0;4];
b) a=10;b=’pi’;syms c; d=[1,2;0,4];
c) a=10;b=pi;syms (c); d=[1,2;0,4];
d) a=10;b=’pi’;syms c; d=[1,2;0,4];
a
a=10;b=’pi’;syms c; d=[1,2;0;4];

b) 16 bytes and 112 bytes
c) 32 bytes and 26 bytes
d) 23 bytes and 112 bytes
a
9.  Choose the correct option as an inference from the following workspace view.
a) ‘ans’, ‘p’ and ‘ap’ are double variables
b) ‘ans’ and ‘p’ are double variables while ‘c’ is a character variable
c) ‘ap’ is symbolic object, ‘c’ is a double variable
d) ‘c’ is a symbolic character
b
10. What is the difference between who and whos command?
a) The former shows the names of the variables being used while the latter shows the details of the variables in the ongoing program
b) The latter shows the the names of the variables being used while the former shows the details of the variables in the ongoing program
c) No difference at all
d) There is no such function as who and whos
a
11. What is the conclusion from the following code?
 >>whos
 Name     Size         Bytes    Class     Attributes
 ans      1x1            8      double              
 ap       1x1          112  	sym              
 c        1x2            4      char
 p        1x1            8      double
a) The function ‘whos’ doesn’t show the values of the variables being used
b) The value of each variable is 0
c) The function ‘who’ is more effective than ‘whos’
d) Nothing can be concluded
a
12.  What are Max and Min in the Workspace shown below?
a) They show the maximum and minimum value of the variable
b) The show the maximum and minimum length of the variable
c) They show the maximum and minimum value present in an array
d) They show the median and mode of the variable
c
13.  How would you express a pi as a character and an integer? Choose the correct code.
a) a=pi;b=’pi’;
b) a=22/7; b=pi;
c) a=3.1415; b=22/7;
d) a=3.1429;b=’pi’;
a
A character variable is stored by declaring the character value within a pair of single inverted commas. An integer variable is stored by simply declaring the variable with the integer value. pi is stored in MATLAB as an integer value itself of 3.1416.
