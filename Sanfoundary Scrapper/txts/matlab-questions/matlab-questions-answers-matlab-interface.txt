1. Which functions help you to save and load variables?
a) 
>> save Lays [a,b]
>> load('myfile.mat')
b) 
>> save Lays {a b}
>> load myfile.mat
c) 
>> save Lays “a,b”
>> load(myfile.mat)
d) 
>> save Lays a b
>> load('myfile.mat')
d
Output: 
>>a=5;b=a;
>> save Lays a b;     % Now go to workspace and delete the variables
>> load('Lays.mat');%Check workspace.
