1.  A student has created a plot of y(t)=t2. He is need to show another graph of z(t)=t3 in the same plot. But every time he hits the plot() function- MATLAB generates a plot of z(t) vs t but on a different window. What is the error?
a) It is not possible to plot multiple plots
b) He is not using the line function
c) Maybe he is using stem() instead of plot()
d) He is not using the hold function
d
2. Does the plot function take multiple arguments to a plot?
a) True
b) False
c) Sometimes
d) Only if the functions are in time domain
a
3. What happens if we don’t stop the implementation of the hold function?
a) Nothing happens
b) MATLAB keeps on generating multiple plots in the same window
c) Error is generated
d) Plot function won’t work
b
4. Is histogram a kind of multiple plots?
a) True
b) False
c) Cannot be determined
d) There is no such thing called Histogram
a
5. The function to plot vector fields is ___________
a) quiver()
b) pie3
c) ezplot()
d) contour()
a
6. How to introduce a title to describe the subplots generated in MATLAB?
a) Use a function
b) Use the title function
c) Use the legend function
d) Use uipanel()
d
f=figure;
c=uipanel(‘Parent’,f,’BorderType’,’none’);
c.Title=’Title Name’;
c.TitlePosition=’centertop’
7.  Can we have multiple 3d plots in MATLAB?
a) Yes
b) No
c) Maybe
d) Cannot be determined
a
8. The student receives an error while trying to plot multiple graphs using the hold command. What is there error if there is no a syntactical error?
a) Cannot be determined
b) The plot function is not defined with a constant variable range
c) There is no hold command
d) There has to be a syntactical error only
b
9. What is the difference between hold on and hold all?
a) no difference
b) hold all holds every plot while hold on holds a specific plot in the chain of argument
c) hold all does not exist
d) hold on is syntactically incorrect
a
10. What is the purpose of the line command if the plot command can be used to directly accept the arguments and generate a plot?
a) Saves complexity
b) We can refrain from using the hold function
c) There is no separate, definite purpose
d) Cannot conclude
d
