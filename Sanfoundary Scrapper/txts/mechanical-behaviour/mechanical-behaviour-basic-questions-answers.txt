6. The stability of dislocations ____ with an increase in the Burgers vector.
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains constant
d) Increases then decrease
b
7. What is the expression for the force required to bend the dislocation to radius R?
a) Gb/2R
b) Gb/R
c) GbR
d) Gb2/R
a
8. What is the percentage contribution of elastic strain in the total energy of dislocation?
a) 10%
b) 30%
c) 70%
d) 90%
d
9.  Elastic strain energy _____ with an increase in length.
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains constant
d) Increases then decrease
a
10. Line tension (T) is _____
a) ∝ b
b) ∝ b1/2
c) ∝ b2
d) ∝ b3
c
Here, G is shear modulus and b is Burgers vector. So line tension associated with dislocation is proportional to the square of Burgers vector. 
11. A dislocation can avoid obstacles by a glide.
a) True
b) False
b
12. As a distance between precipitate particles increases, shear stress to bend dislocation decreases.
a) True
b) False
