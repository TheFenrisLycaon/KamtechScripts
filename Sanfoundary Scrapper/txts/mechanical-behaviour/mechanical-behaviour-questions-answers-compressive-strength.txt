d
7. When a material is pulled in tension, it exhibits the reduction in compressive strength.
a) True
b) False
a
8. For _____ value of a rate of loading, the value of strength comes out to be ______
a) Lower, lower
b) Lower, higher
c) Any, same
d) Any, different independent of a rate of loading
a
9. As the w/c ratio (mass of water/mass of cement) of concrete increases, the porosity ______ and as the result compressive strength ______
a) Increases, increases
b) Increases, decreases
c) Decreases, increases
d) Decreases, increases
b
10. Which machine is used to measure compressive strength?

b
11. What is compressive stress of cylindrical specimen of diameter 2 cm and applied force is 10N?
a) 796 kN/m2
b) 450 kN/m2
c) 678 kN/m2
d) 875 kN/m2
a
                                  = 10 / π (0.002)2
                                  = 795774.72 N/m2
                                  ~ 796 kN/m2
Here F = force, A = original cross sectional area.
