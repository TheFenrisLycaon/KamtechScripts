b
10. Neutron irradiation by neutrons can ___ yield stress and ___ ductility.
a) Increase, increase
b) Increase, decrease
c) Decrease, increase
d) Decrease, decrease
b
11.  With the increase in the degree of stress triaxiality, ductility of material decreases.
a) True
b) False
a
12. As the strain rate increases, the value of ductility ___

13. Original gauge length of aluminium cylindrical spectrum is 2 inches and fracture length is 2.78 inches. What is the ductility of specimen?
a) 38%
b) 39%
c) 40%
d) 41%
b
Here, lf = Fracture length, l0 = original length. 
14. A cylindrical specimen having diameter of 12.8 mm is starting and 7.3 mm at the fracture point. What is ductility?
a) 56%
b) 64%
c) 67%
d) 78%
c
Here, A0 = original cross-sectional area of specimen, Af = original cross-sectional area at fracture point.
= \(\frac{(\pi(6.4)^2 – \pi(3.65)^2)}{\pi(6.4)^2}\) × 100
= \(\frac{(128.68 – 41.853)}{128.68}\) × 100
= 0.675 × 100 = 67.5%.
