1. Which factor doesn’t promote fine grain structure?
a) Fast cooling rates
b) Inoculating agents
c) Mechanical vibrations
d) Longer holding times at high temperature
d
2. For ASTM grain size number 10, give the number of grains per square inch at a magnification of 100x.
a) 512
b) 1024
c) 2048
d) 200
a
where n is ASTM grain size number
N is the number of grains in one square inch
M is the magnification
It gives 512 grains per square inch.
3. What is the ASTM grain size number for 1024 grains per square inch at 100x magnification?
a) 10
b) 11
c) 12
d) 13
b
4. Hall-Petch equation gives the relation between grain size and ___
a) Toughness
b) Ductility
c) Yield strength
d) Tensile strength
c
5. Which symbol represents frictional stress in the Hall-Petch equation?
a) σ0
b) σi
c) Ky
d) d
b
6. What term is used for the temperature at which the strength of grain boundary and strength of grain is equal?
a) Equicohesive temperature
b) Curie temperature
c) Recrystallization temperature
d) Hardening temperature
a
7. Which property doesn’t improve on grain refinement?
a) Fatigue strength
b) Tensile strength
c) Hardness
d) Creep strength
d
8. A material shows maximum strength when it consists of ____ dislocations.
a) No
b) Large number of
c) Very less number of
d) Intermediate number of
a
9. The number of dislocations is directly proportional to ___ and inversely proportional to ___
a) Shear modulus, Burgers vector
b) Shear modulus, Stress
c) Stress, Shear modulus
d) Burgers vector, Stress
c
Here, the number of dislocations N which can be piled into a length L of a slip plane, b burgers vector and G is shear modulus. This relation was given by Eshelby.
10. Grain refinement decreases ductility of the material.
a) True
b) False
b
11. Grain size strengthening can be understood by __________
a) Orowan mechanism
b) Hall-Petch equation
c) Schmid’s law
d) Bragg’s law
b
