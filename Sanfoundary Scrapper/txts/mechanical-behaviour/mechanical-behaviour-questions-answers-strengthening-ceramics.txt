1. In general, ceramics fail under ___________ stress.
a) Shear
b) Compressive
c) Tensile
d) Normal
c
2. Low tensile strength of ceramics is related to ___________
a) Dislocations
b) Structural defects
c) Grain boundaries
d) Vacancy
b
3. What is the common process of fabrication of ceramics?
a) Sintering
b) Rolling
c) Forging
d) Casting
a
4. Presence of pores in ceramics ____________ the true cross-section over which the applied load is acting.
a) Increase
b) Decrease
c) Doesn’t change
d) Can increase or decrease
b
5. The strength ____________ with increasing the volume fraction of pores.
a) Linearly decreases
b) Linearly increases
c) Exponentially increases
d) Exponentially decreases
d
σp = σ0 exp(-BP)
Where P is volume fraction porosity. Hence strength exponentially reduces with increase in pores.
6. Surface compressive stresses enhance ______________ of ceramic.
a) Thermal shock resistance
b) Volume
c) Ductility
d) Grain boundary area
a
7. Smaller the grain size ____________ will be the fracture stress.
a) Higher
b) Lower
c) Constant
d) Can’t say
a
8. __________ glass is thermally strengthened glass.
a) Quenched
b) Tempered
c) Ceramic
d) Polycrystalline
b
9. Tempered glass consists __________ stresses at center and _______ at the surface.
a) Tensile, tensile
b) Tensile, compressive
c) Compressive, tensile
d) Compressive, compressive
b
10. In following options, what is not a purpose of glazing?
a) Introduce residual surface compressive stress
b) Make ceramic impermeable to liquid
c) Make article attractive
d) Coarsening of grain size
d
11. Glazes are alumina mixtures.
a) True
b) False
b
12. Ion implantation causes improvement in fracture toughness and fatigue strength.
a) True
b) False
a
