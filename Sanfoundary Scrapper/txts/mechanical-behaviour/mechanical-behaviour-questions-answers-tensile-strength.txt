b) Decreases
c) Remains constant
d) First decreases then increase
a
6. Which one of the following factor decreases the tensile strength?
a) Cold working
b) Alloying
c) Temperature rise
d) Grain refinement
c

a) With an increase in the degree of cold working, UTS increases.
b) UTS increases with a decrease in temperature.
c) UPS increases with an increase in grain size.
d) Larger the difference between the radius of solute and solvent atoms of alloy, higher is the tensile strength.
c
8. Tensile strength is used as a design criterion for ductile materials.
a) True
b) False
b
9. If the Brinell hardness of a steel specimen is measured 149 HBN. What will be the UTS?
a) 431 MPa
b) 514 MPa
c) 608 MPa
d) 637 MPa
b
                        TS = 3.45 × 149
                             = 514.05
                             ~ 514 MPa
Here, HBN = Brinell hardness, TS = tensile strength of material in MPa. 
10. Brinell hardness of a steel specimen is 151 HBN. Give the value of UTS of Steel in psi.
a) 520 psi
b) 42050 psi
c) 75500 psi
d) 86200 psi
c
                       TS = 500 × 151
                            = 75500 psi
Here, HBN = Brinell hardness, TS = tensile strength of material in psi. 
11. Find the minimum tensile strength of spring material ASTM A232 having diameter 3 millimeter, exponent m = 0.155 and constant A = 173 kpsi.
a) 120 kpsi
b) 146 kpsi
c) 158 kpsi
d) 167 kpsi
b
     = 173/30.155
     = 145.91
     ~ 146 kpsi                                                                                                                                                              Here, A = material constant in kpsi, d = diameter in mm, m = exponent value, TS = tensile strength of material in kpsi. 
12. Tensile strength depends on the molecular structure of the material.
a) True
b) False
a
13. Tensile strength increases with increasing ______
a) Temperature
b) Molecular weight
c) Purity
d) Grain size
b
