11. Material has tensile strength 40 MPa and fracture strain 0.39. What will be approximate value of toughness?
a) 10.2 MJ/m3
b) 15.6 MJ/m3
c) 16.7 MJ/m3
d) 18.9 MJ/m3
b
                     UT ≈ σu εf
                                ≈ 40 × 0.39
                          ≈ 15.6 MJ/m3
Here, σu = tensile stress, εf = fracture strain.
12. A material has tensile strength 210 MPa, yield strength 117 MPa and fracture strain 0.45. What will be approximate value of toughness?
a) 54.8 MJ/m3
b) 67.4 MJ/m3
c) 73.6 MJ/m3
d) 89.2 MJ/m3
c
                       UT ≈ ((σu + σy)  εf)/2
                    ≈((210 + 117)  0.45)/2
                             ≈ 73.6 MJ/m3
Here, σu = tensile stress, σy = yield stress, εf = fracture strain.
