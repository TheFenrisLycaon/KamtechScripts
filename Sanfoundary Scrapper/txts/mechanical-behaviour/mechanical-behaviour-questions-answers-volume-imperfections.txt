1. Which one of the following, is not volume defect?
a) Pore
b) Void
c) Vacancy
d) Blow hole
c
2. Continuous precipitation is observed in the system ________
a) Fe-C
b) Pb-Sn
c) Al-Cu
d) Al-Mg
c
3. Cellular precipitation is also known as ______
a) Continuous
b) Discontinuance
c) Coherent
d) Semi coherent
b
4. Precipitation hardening deteriorates ______ of material.
a) Tensile strength
b) High temperature properties
c) Ductility
d) Hardness
c
5. What is the dimension of voids?
a) 106 – 108 nm
b) 10 – 107 nm
c) 10 – 105 nm
d) 10 – 102 nm
a
6. Which one of the following factor does not favour void formation?
a) Slow quenching rates
b) Low ageing temperature
c) High ageing temperature
d) Presence of gas
b
7. Hydrogen induced cracks are generally intergranular.
a) True
b) False
b
8. Voids formed due to shrinkage of material, during its solidification, are known as _______
a) Cavitation
b) Porosity
c) Inclusion
d) Blow hole
a
9. What causes blow holes in casting?
a) Soft ramming
b) Venting
c) Insufficient permeability
d) Risering system
c
10. If Young’s modulus of tungsten carbide is 450 GPa, what will be Young’s modulus for 4% porous tungsten carbide?
a) 450 GPa
b) 415.8 GPa
c) 410.4 GPa
d) 425.8 GPa
b
Here, P = porosity fraction, E0 = Young’s modulus for uncracked material, E = Young’s modulus
                       E = 450 (1 – 1.9×0.04)
                          = 415.8 GPa.  
11. With increase in porosity Young’s modulus ________
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains constant
d) First increases and then decreases
b
12. Ceramics are sensitive for defects like inclusion and void.
a) True
b) False
a
