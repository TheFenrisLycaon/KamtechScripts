1. Dislocations of opposite sign on the _____ slip plane will _____ each other.
a) same, attract
b) same, repel
c) different, attract
d) different, repel
a
2. The force of attraction or repulsion _____ with decreasing distance of separation.
a) increases
b) decreases
c) remains constant
d) first increases and then decreases
a
                       F attraction = – Gb2/2π (1-v) r
Here G is shear modulus, b is Burgers vector, r is a distance of separation and v is Poisson’s ratio. Here in both cases, force is inversely proportional to separation distance.
