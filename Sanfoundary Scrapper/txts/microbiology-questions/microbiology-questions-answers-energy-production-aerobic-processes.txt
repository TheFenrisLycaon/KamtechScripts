1. The TCA Cycle is an _____________ pathway.
a) catabolic
b) anabolic
c) amphibolic
d) respiratory
c
2. Which of the following intermediates of TCA cycle act as amino acid precursors?
a) oxaloacetic acid
b) succinic acid
c) citric acid
d) acetyl CoA
a
3. Which pathway will result in the production of four carbon dioxide molecules, two ATP molecules, NADH2 and FADH2?
a) glycolysis
b) Krebs cycle
c) Calvin cycle
d) electron transport system
b
2Acetyl CoA+ 3H2O + 3NAD+ + FAD+ ADP+ Pi———> 4CO2+ 2CoA+ 2NADH2+ 2FADH2+ ATP.
4. The TCA cycle is regulated by which of the following enzymes?
a) citrate synthase
b) isocitrate dehydrogenase
c) malate dehydrogenase
d) succinate dehydrogenase
b
5. Protein molecules can easily pass into the cell for being utilized for energy production.
a) True
b) False
b
6. Which of the following pathway is common for oxidation of carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids?
a) Calvin cycle
b) Electron transport chain
c) TCA cycle
d) Pentose phosphate pathway
c
7. Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is converted to oxaloacetate by the enzyme PEP deaminase.
a) True
b) False
b
8. The enzymes present in glyoxylate cycle are which type of enzymes?
a) reductase enzymes
b) anaplerotic enzymes
c) transferase enzymes
d) hydrolase enzymes
b
9. Which molecule will combine with the four-carbon oxaloacetate in the TCA cycle to form the six-carbon citrate?
a) lactic acid
b) NADH
c) ATP
d) acetyl-CoA
d
10. The number of ATP molecules generated in TCA cycle is _________
a) 34
b) 38
c) 24
d) 12
c
                     6 NADH2 —> 18 ATP
                     2 FADH2 —>  4 ATP
                      2 GTP    —>   2 ATP
Thus, total ATP = 24 ATP.
