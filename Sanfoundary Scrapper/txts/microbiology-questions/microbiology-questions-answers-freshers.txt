1. Which of the following is an indirect method for measuring bacterial growth?
a) Cell count
b) Cell mass
c) Cell activity
d) Both Cell mass and Cell activity
c
2. Which of the following instrument is used for the bacterial count?
a) Petroff-Hausser counting chamber
b) Microscope
c) Chemostat
d) Turbidostat
a
3. Which of the following method is used for a viable count of a culture?
a) Direct microscopic count
b) Plate-count method
c) Membrane-filter count
d) Plate-count method and membrane-filter count
d
4. The number of bacteria per ml depends on the dilution of the sample.
a) True
b) False
a
Number of bacteria per ml = Number of colonies counted on plate X dilution of sample.
Thus number of bacteria directly depends on the dilution of sample.
5. Which of the following is the relationship between optical density and cell mass?
a) exponentially proportional
b) linearly proportional
c) inversely proportional
d) not related
b
6. How many cells present per milliliter in a bacterial culture can make the culture turbid?
a)1 cell
b)1000 cells
c)1 lakh cells
d)107-108  cells
d
7. A dead cell does not contribute to turbidity in the culture medium.
a) True
b) False
b
8. Which of the following is a direct measurement of growth?
a) Determination of nitrogen content
b) Turbidimetric methods
c) Determination of Dry weight of cells
d) Measurement of a specific chemical change produced on a constituent of the medium
c
9. Which of the following method is used for enumeration of bacteria in vaccines and cultures?
a) Microscopic Count
b) Membrane filter
c) Plate count
d) Dry weight determination
a
10. Colony-forming units per ml is the unit of _____________
a) Microscopic count
b) Electronic enumeration
c) Plate count
d) Turbidimetric measurement
c
