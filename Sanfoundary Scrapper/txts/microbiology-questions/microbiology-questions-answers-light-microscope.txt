1. Which part of the compound microscope helps in gathering and focusing light rays on the specimen to be viewed?
a) Eyepiece lens
b) Objective lens
c) Condenser lens
d) Magnifying lens
c
2. What is the minimum distance for the eye to focus any object?
a) 11 cm
b) 25 cm
c) 32 cm
d) 4 2 cm
b
3. Resolving power of a microscope is a function of ____________
a) Wavelength of light used
b) Numerical aperture of lens system
c) Refractive index
d) Wavelength of light used and numerical aperture of lens system
d
4. The greatest resolution in light microscopy can be obtained with ___________
a) Longest wavelength of visible light used
b) An objective with minimum numerical aperture
c) Shortest wavelength of visible light used
d) Shortest wavelength of visible light used and an objective with the maximum numerical aperture
d
                      Resolution (d) = wavelength / 2(NA)
Thus maximum resolution is obtained with the shortest wavelength of visible light and an objective with the maximum NA.
5. Oil immersion objective lens has an NA value of____________
a) 0.65
b) 0.85
c) 1.33
d) 1.00
c
The maximum NA for a dry objective is less than 1.0 as the refractive index of air is 1. The values of NA for oil immersion lens is slightly greater than 1.0 in the range of (1.2 to 1.4) as the refractive index of oil is 1.56.
6. In fluorescence microscopy, which of the following performs the function of removing all light except the blue light?
a) Exciter filter
b) Barrier filter
c) Dichroic mirror
d) Mercury arc lamp
a
7. Total Magnification is obtained by __________
a) Magnifying power of the objective lens
b) Magnifying power of eyepiece
c) Magnifying power of condenser lens
d) Magnifying power of both the objective lens and eyepiece
d
8. In light microscopy, which of the following is used as fixatives prior to staining technique?
a) Osmic acid
b) Glutaraldehyde
c) Heat
d) Osmic acid, glutaraldehyde, heat
c
9. In Phase contrast microscopy, the rate at which light enters through objects is __________
a) Constant
b) Inversely proportional to their refractive indices
c) Directly proportional to their refractive indices
d) Exponentially related to their refractive indices
b
10. Which part of the light microscope controls the intensity of light entering the viewing area?
a) Coarse adjustment screw
b) Fine adjustment screw
c) Diaphragm
d) Condenser lens
c
