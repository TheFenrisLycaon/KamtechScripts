1. “DJNZ R0, label” is ________ byte instruction.
a) 2
b) 3
c) 1
d) Can’t be determined
a
2. JZ, JNZ, instructions checked content of _______ register.
a) DPTR
b) B
c) A
d) PSW
c
3. Calculate the jump code for again and here if code starts at 0000H
MOV R1,#0
MOV A,#0
MOV R0,#25H
AGAIN:ADD A,#0ECH
JNC HERE
HERE: INC R1
DJNZ R0,AGAIN 
MOV R0,A
END
a) F3,02
b) F9,01
c) E9,01
d) E3,02
c
So here if we start with 0000H
then source address is 0008H and the destination address is 0004H
So loop address is 04-0A=E9

b) 0.60 micro seconds
c) 0.75 micro seconds
d) 1 micro seconds
b
8. Find the number of times the following loop will be executed
MOV R6,#200
BACK:MOV R5,#100
HERE:DJNZ R5, HERE
DJNZ R6,BACK
END
a) 100
b) 200
c) 20000
d) 2000
c

a) data 05H is stored in the accumulator
b) fifth bit of accumulator is set to one
c) address 05H is stored in the accumulator
d) none of the mentioned
c
10.  Do the two instructions mean the same?
1) BACK:  DEC R0            
          JZ BACK
2) BACK:  DJNZ RO, BACK
a) yes
b) no
c) cant be determined
d) yes and the second one is preferred
b
