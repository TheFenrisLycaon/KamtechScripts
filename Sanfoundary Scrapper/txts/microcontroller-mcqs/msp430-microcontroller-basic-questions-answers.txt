1. Which of the following registers are related to port P1?
a) P1SEL
b) P1DIR
c) P1IES
d) All of the mentioned
d
P1SEL → Port Select Port pins are often multiplexed with other peripheral module functions. P1SEL and P1SEL2 bit is used to select the pin function – I/O port or peripheral module function.
P1DIR → Direction register selects the direction of the corresponding I/O pin.
P1IES → Interrupt Edge Select.
2. A pull-up or pull-down resistor ___________

4. What actually is SD16_A?
a) it is an interrupt
b) it is a timer
c) it is an analog to Digital Converter
d) it is a serial communication module
c
5. P1IE and P1IES are registers that are used to ___________
a) control the Port1 digital i/o ports
b) control the Port1 interrupts

7. Which of the following is an effect of a Schmidt trigger?
a) it turns slowly varying inputs, which might cause problems while they pass slowly through the undefined range of input voltages, into abrupt, clean logical transitions
b) It eliminates the effect of noise on the input, provided that it is not large enough to span the gap between the upward and downward thresholds
c) none of the mentioned
d) all of the mentioned
d
8. To ensure that a negative fluctuation does not trigger an unwanted downward transition by pulling the input down through VIT−, we must choose
