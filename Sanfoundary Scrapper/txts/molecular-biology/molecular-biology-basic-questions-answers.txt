1. For the correct addition of amino acid to the growing polypeptide chain which of the following does not play any role?
a) Loading of initiator tRNA to the P site
b) Loading of correct aminoacyl tRNA to the A site
c) Formation of peptide bond between the existing amino acid and the incoming amino acid
d) The formed tRNA with the growing polypeptide is translocated from the A site to the P site
a
i) Loading of correct aminoacyl tRNA to the A site
ii) Formation of peptide bond between the existing amino acid and the incoming amino acid
iii) The formed tRNA with the growing polypeptide is translocated from the A site to the P site
