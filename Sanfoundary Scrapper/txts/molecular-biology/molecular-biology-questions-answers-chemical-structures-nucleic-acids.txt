1. Which macromolecule is not abundantly found though being of critical importance for biological mechanisms?
a) Proteins
b) Lipids
c) Nucleic acids
d) Polysaccharides
b
2. Which of the following is wrongly paired?
a) Proteins – peptide bond
b) Nucleic acid – hydrogen bond
c) Polysaccharide – glycosidic bond
d) Phospholipids –phosphate linkage
b
3. With respect to nucleosides which of the following is paired correctly?
a) Purine – Adenosine, Thymidine
b) Purine – Guanosine, Thymidine
c) Pyrimidine – Uridine, Cytidine
d) Pyrimidine – Uridine, Adenosine
c
4. Which of the following is not a component of the nucleic acid backbone?
a) Pentose sugar
b) Phosphate group
c) Nucleotide
d) Phosphodiesterase bond
c
5. According to Chargaff’s rule the two strands of DNA has ___________
a) Same molecular weight
b) Same amount of A and G
c) Different amount of A and G
d) Different molecular weight
d
6. In one strand of a double stranded DNA the rate of occurrence of A is 3 times C in consecutive 10 bases. So how many G will be there in 100 base pairs of a DNA duplex?[Consider G=T in one strand].
a) 30
b) 20
c) 40
d) 60
c
Therefore, A = 3C = (3*1) = 3
Now, A+C = (3+1) = 4
Again G = T [given] 
And A+C+G+T = 10 [given] 
Now replacing T with G and putting the value of A+C
We get,
4 + 2G = 10
2G = 6
G = 3, T = 3, A = 3, C = 1
Thus in 100 bases in one strand there are (3*10 = 30) G residues
Now for the complementary strand G = C residues [Chargaff’s rule] 
Therefore, C = G = 1 residue in every 10 bases
That is, G = 1*10 = 10 in 100 bases
Therefore total number of G residues = 30 + 10 = 40 in 100 base pairs of a DNA duplex.
7. In a diploid organism with 30,000 bases haploid genome contains 23% A residues. What is the number of G residues in the genome of this organism?
a) 16000
b) 16200
c) 16500
d) 14200
b
Therefore, G + C = [100 – (A+T)] 
 G + C = [100 – 46] 
 G + C = 54
 G = C = 27 [By Chargaff’s rule] 
 Therefore, G = 27%
 Now, each cell is diploid thus it contains (2*30,000 = 60,000) bases
So, G = 27% of 60,000
 G = 16,200 bases. 
8. Which of the following is not a characteristic of nucleotide bases?
a) Planar
b) Heterocyclic
c) Aliphatic
d) Ubiquitous
c
9. Which of the following factors do not provide to the separation of DNA fragments during electrophoresis?
a) Chargaff’s rule
b) Matrix density
c) Ethidium bromide
d) Size
c
10. Which one of the following is not a function of a nucleotide?
a) Nucleic acid monomer
b) Ribozyme
c) Energy carrier molecules
d) Receptors
d
