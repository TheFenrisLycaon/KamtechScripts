2. Pick the correct pair with respect to primers used in DNA replication.
a) RNA primer- for prokaryotes only
b) DNA primer-for eukaryotes only
c) DNA primer- for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
d) RNA primer- for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes
d
3. Which of the following is correctly matched with its subsequent role?
a) Topoisomerase II- can remove both positive and negative supercoil in the DNA duplex
b) Polymerase I- larger fragment responsible for exonuclease activity
c) DnaA protein- responsible for “melting” of the DNA double helix during replication

c
i) Topoisomerase II- converts a positive supercoil to a negative supercoil, also known as gyrase
ii) Polymerase I- larger (klenow) fragment is responsible for polymerase activity
iii) DnaB protein- also known as helicase helps in unwinding of DNA duplex to form the open complex.
