6. With respect to the genetic code reading frame which of the following is wrong?
a) 5’ → 3’ direction reading frame
b) The code is non – overlapping
c) No gaps present

d
7. The mitochondrial mRNA code for methionine is _____________
a) UAA
b) AGA
c) AUA
d) AUG
c
8. The mitochondrial genome has _____________ stop codons.
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
d
9. Fruitfly mitochondrial codes AGA and AGG codes for _____________
a) Termination
b) Tryptophan
c) Serine
d) Arginine
c
10. With respect to the universal genetic code pick the odd one out.
a) UAA – Glutamine
b) UGG – Tryptophan
c) AGA – Stop
d) CUG – Serine
b
UAA – Glutamine codon in some unicellular protozoa whereas codes for chain termination in the universal codon.
AGA – Stop codon in mammalian mitochondria but is the universal code for arginine.
CUG – Serine codon in the yeast (Candida) but is the universal code for leucine.
