1. With respect to DNA polymerase holoenzyme pick the odd one out.
a) 2 copies of DNA polymerase III
b) 5 protein γ complex
c) Presence of ATP
d) Presence of DNA
d
2. A complete DNA polymerase III holoenzyme contains ____________ subunits.
a) 2
b) 4
c) 6
d) 8
c
3. How many polymerases are present in a replication fork?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
b
4. With respect to eukaryotic replication which of the following enzyme is not correctly paired with its function?
a) Primase – initiation of new strand synthesis
b) RF-C – recruitment, maintenance and coordination of DNA polymerases
c) DNA polymerase ε – elongation of DNA strand
d) τ protein – binds to DNA polymerase
b
5. The formation of the phosphodiester bond is an example of _________ reaction.
a) SN1
b) SN2
c) E1
d) E2
b
6. DNA synthesis is known as a coupled process.
a) True
b) False
a
 But the free energy for this reaction is rather small. Additional free energy is provided by the rapid hydrolysis of the pyrophosphates into two phosphate groups (P – P → 2Pi). The net result of nucleotide and pyrophosphate hydrolysis is the breaking of two high – energy phosphate bonds. Therefore, DNA synthesis is known as a coupled process.
7. DNA helicase travels along _________
a) Leading strand template in 3’→5’ direction
b) Leading strand template in 5’→3’ direction
c) Lagging strand template in 3’→5’ direction
d) Lagging strand template in 5’→3’ direction
d
8. DNA polymerase III holoenzyme does not need to interact with the helicase during replication.
a) True
b) False
b
9. Binding of polymerase III and helicase ensures helicase efficiency.
a) True
b) False
a
10. Association of primase with DNA template is brought about by the interaction of primase with _________________
a) Dna polymerase III
b) Clamp-loader complex
c) Helicase and SSB protein
d) τ protein
c
11. How is the strength of the interaction between primase and helicase which regulates the length of Okazaki fragments?
a) Weak association short fragment
b) Strong association short fragment
c) Strong association long fragment
d) Does not depend on strength of association
b
12. Which of the following enzyme is not required for the synthesis of lagging strand?
a) Primase
b) Gyrase
c) Helicase
d) Exonuclease
b
i) Primase – synthesis of primer for replication
ii) Helicase – unwinds the DNA during replication
iii) Exonuclease – hydrolysis of the rNTP of the primer that is directly bound to the dNTP of the newly synthesized strand
iv) Gyrase – releases stress by removing supercoils within the DNA helix. Thus gyrase does not take part in the synthesis of lagging strand.
13. Length of Okazaki fragments in eukaryotes ranges between ____________ nucleotides.
a) 100 – 400
b) 400 – 800
c) 800 – 1200
d) 1200 – 1600
a
14. Polymerization of dNTP by DNA polymerase is in 3’ → 5’ direction.
a) True
b) False
b
