c
2. Which of the following function of DNA is necessary for the purpose of evolution?

d
3. According to the phenotypic characters of pneumococcus considered in Griffith’s experiment of transformation, which of the following statements are correct?

i) Presence of slime layer
ii) Presence of capsule 
iii) Absence of capsule
iv) Type of adhesion
v) Molecular makeup of capsule
a) i, ii, iii
b) ii, iii, iv
c) ii, iii, v
d) i, iv, v
c
i) Presence or absence of polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the bacterial cell which is responsible for its characteristic smooth or rough colonies respectively
ii) The type of capsule i.e., the specific molecular composition of the polysaccharide present in the capsule coded by its genome, thus triggering immune response of a specific type.
4. Which of the following combination is a correct observation for the transformation experiment performed by Griffith?
a) Type IIIS (living) + mouse = dead
b) Type IIIS (heat killed) + mouse = dead
c) Type IIR (living) + mouse = dead
d) Type IIIS (heat killed) + type IIR (living) + mouse = living
a
5. Fredrick Griffith’s experiment involving Streptococcus pneumonia lead to the discovery of____________
a) DNA as genetic material
b) RNA as genetic material
c) Protein as genetic material
d) Transforming principle
d
6. Definite results proving DNA to be genetic material was given by __________
a) Fredrick Griffith
b) Hershey and Chase
c) Avery, Macleod and MacCarty
d) Meselson and Stahl
c
i) Using DNase to degrade DNA
ii) Using RNase to degrade RNA
iii) Using Protease to degrade proteins
Thus, when the separate combinations were injected into mice respectively the transforming principle was found to be DNA.
Note- Only these three enzymes were used as only their subsequent substrates were the main factors that were in conflict to be the genetic material.
7. Which of the following statements regarding the mechanism of transformation in Bacillus subtilis is false?
a) A competent bacteria contains a DNA receptor/translocation complex

c) While translocation of exogenous DNA, only one strand gets passage into the cell
d) The exogenous DNA recombines and incorporates itself in the chromosome of the recipient cell.
b
8. What were the main criteria taken under consideration for the experiment by Hershey and Chase?
a) DNA contains phosphorus, protein contains sulfur
b) Protein contains phosphorus, DNA contains sulfur
c) Both DNA and protein contains phosphorus and not sulphur
d) Both DNA and protein contains sulfur and not phosphorus
a
