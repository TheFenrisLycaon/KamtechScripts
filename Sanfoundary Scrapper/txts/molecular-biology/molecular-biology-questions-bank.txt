1. What does the diagram denote?
a) Splicing
b) Alternative splicing
c) Trans-splicing
d) Exon shuffling
c
2. Splicosome comprises of ______________
a) Only proteins
b) Only RNA
c) RNA and protein
d) RNA and lipoprotein
c
3. Splicosome is a proteinaceous enzyme.
a) True
b) False
b
4. “snurps” are made of ____________
a) RNA
b) Protein
c) DNA and protein
d) RNA and protein
d
5. Which of the following is not a function of snRNPs?
a) 5’ splice site reorganization
b) 3’ splice site reorganization
c) Branch point site
d) Catalyze 5’ splice site cleavage
b
i) 5’ splice site reorganization,
ii) Branch point site,
iii) Catalysis of 5’ splice site cleavage by bringing the 5’ splice site and the branch point site close together.
6. 5’ splice site is recognized by which of the following type of RNA present in the splicosome?
a) U2
b) U4
c) U5
d) U6
d
7. Which of the following splicosomal RNAs does not take part in the 5’ site splicing of the intron?
a) U1
b) U2
c) U5
d) U6
c
8. Which of the following component of splicosome recognizes the 3’ splice site?
a) U2
b) U2AF
c) BBP
d) U4
a
9. Which of the following proteins is correctly paired to its function?
a) U2AF – binds to branch point site
b) DEAD-box – recognizes pyrimidine tract
c) RNA annealing factor – loading snRNPs onto mRNA
d) BBP – dissociation of RNA–RNA interactions
c
i) U2AF – recognizes pyrimidine tract
ii) DEAD-box – dissociation of RNA–RNA interactions
iii) RNA annealing factor – loading snRNPs onto mRNA
iv) BBP – binds to branch point site. 
10. Which of the following is not involved in creating the early splicosome complex?
a) Base pairing of U1 and splice site
b) U2AF binding to 3’ splicing site
c) U2 binding to branch point site
d) BBP interaction with U2AF
c
i) 5’ splice site is recognized by the U1 snRNP.
ii) One subunit of U2AF binds to the 3’ subunit and the other to the pyrimidine tract.
iii) The BBP then interaction with U2AF thus finally binding to the branch point site.
This finally gives rise to the early complex of the splicosome.
