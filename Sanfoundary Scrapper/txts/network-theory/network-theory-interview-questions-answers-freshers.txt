1. Reciprocity Theorem is applied for _____ networks.
a) Linear
b) Bilateral
c) Linear bilateral
d) Lumped
c
2. Reciprocity Theorem is used to find the change in _______ when the resistance is changed in the circuit.
a) Voltage
b) Voltage or current
c) Current
d) Power
b
3. Find the current through 3Ω resistor in the circuit shown below.
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
a
4. Determine the current flowing in the ammeter having 1Ω internal resistance connected in series with the 3Ω resistor as shown in the below circuit.
a) 0.91
b) 0.92
c) 0.93
d) 0.94
c
Now current through 3Ω resistor = 0.17A. This current is opposite to the current calculated before. So ammeter reading = (1.11-0.17) = 0.94A.
5. Find the current through 6Ω resistor in the circuit shown below.
a) 0.33
b) 0.44
c) 0.55
d) 0.66

6. Determine the current flowing in the ammeter having 1Ω internal resistance connected in series with the 6Ω resistor as shown in the below circuit.
a) 0.4
b) 0.45
c) 0.9
d) 0.95
b
Now the circuit can be modified as
Now current through 6Ω resistor = 0.094A. This current is opposite to the current calculated before. So ammeter reading = (0.55-0.0.94) = 0.45A.
7. Find the current through 6Ω resistor in the circuit shown below.
a) 0.11
b) 0.22
c) 0.33
d) 0.44
c
8. Consider the following circuit. Determine the current flowing in the ammeter having 1Ω internal resistance in series with the 6Ω resistor.
a) 0.1
b) 0.2
c) 0.3
d) 0.4
c
New total current = 0.33/(7+4||2||3)=0.04A. Now reading of ammeter = 0.33-0.04=0.29A ≅ 0.3A.
9. Find the current through 3Ω resistor in the circuit shown below.
a) 0.45
b) 0.56
c) 0.67
d) 0.78
c
10. Consider the following circuit. Determine the current flowing in the ammeter having 1Ω internal resistance in series with the 3Ω resistor.
a) 0.6
b) 0.7
c) 0.8
d) 0.9
a
Current through 3Ω resistor = 0.67/(7 + (4||6||2)) = 0.08A. Ammeter reading = 0.67 – 0.08 = 0.59 ≅ 0.6A.
