1. The basic elements of an electric circuit are _____________
a) R, L and C
b) Voltage
c) Current
d) Voltage as well as current
a
2. In the circuit given below, the value of the maximum power transferred through RL is ___________
a) 0.75 W
b) 1.5 W
c) 2.25 W
d) 1.125 W
a
Or, I = 0.1 A
VOC = 3 × 10 I = 30 I
Or, VOC = 3 V
Now, ISC = 10 I = 1 A
Rth = 3/1 = 3 Ω
Vth = VOC = 3 V
RL = 3 Ω
Pmax = \(\frac{3^2}{4×3}\) = 0.75 W.
3. The energy stored in the magnetic field at a solenoid 100 cm long and 10 cm diameter wound with 1000 turns of wire carrying an electric current of 10 A, is ___________
a) 1.49 J
b) 0.49 J
c) 0.1 J
d) 1 J
b
= \(\frac{10^6.4π.10^{-7}.\frac{π}{4}.(100 X 10^{-4})}{1}\) 
= \(\frac{π^2  X 10^{-3}}{1}\) 
Energy = 0.5 LI2
= 0.49 J.
4. The resistance of a strip of copper of rectangular cross section is 2 Ω. A metal of resistivity twice that of a copper is coated on its upper surface to a thickness equal to that of copper strip. The resistance of composite strip will be _________
a) \(\frac{3}{4}\) Ω
b) \(\frac{4}{3}\) Ω
c) \(\frac{3}{2}\) Ω
d) 6 Ω
b
Hence, the resistance of the composite strip = \(\frac{2 X 4}{2 + 4}\) 
= \(\frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}\) Ω.
5. In the circuit shown below what is the value of RL for which maximum power is transferred to RL?
a) 2.4 Ω
b) \(\frac{8}{3}\) Ω
c) 4 Ω
d) 6 Ω
c
RL = RTH = \(\frac{V_{OC}}{I_{SC}} \) 
Due to open-circuit, VOC = 100 V; ISC = I1 + I2
Applying KVL in lower loop, 100 – 8I1 = 0
Or, I1 = \(\frac{100}{8} = \frac{25}{2}\) 
And VX = -4I1 = -4 × \(\frac{25}{2}\) = -50V
KVL in upper loop, 100 + VX – 4I2 = 0
I2 = \(\frac{100-50}{4} = \frac{25}{2}\) 
Hence, ISC = I1 + I2 = \(\frac{25}{2} + \frac{25}{2}\) = 25
RTH = \(\frac{V_{OC}}{I_{SC}} = \frac{100}{25}\) = 4 Ω
RL = RTH = 4 Ω.

6. A 3 V DC supply with an internal resistance of 2 Ω supplies a passive non-linear resistance characterized by the relation VNL = \(I_{NL}^{2}\). The power dissipated in the resistance is ___________
a) 1 W
b) 1.5 W
c) 2.5 W
d) 3 W
a
∴ I = 1 A; VNL = 1V
∴ Power dissipated in RNL = 1 × 1 = 1 W.
7. The two windings of a transformer have an inductor of 2 H each. If mutual inductor between them is also 2 H, then which of the following is correct?
a) Turns ratio of the transformer is also 2
b) Transformer is an ideal transformer
c) It is a perfect transformer
d) It is a perfect as well as an ideal transformer
c
= \(\frac{2}{\sqrt{2 X 2}}\) = 1
Hence, it is a perfect transformer. 
8. In the circuit given below, what is the amount of maximum power transfer to R?
a) 56 W
b) 76 W
c) 60 W
d) 66 W
d
Also, \(\frac{V-V_{1Ω}}{10} + \frac{V-20-V_{1Ω}}{2} + \frac{V-V_{OC}}{5}\) = 2
Or, 0.1 V – 0.1V1Ω + 0.5V – 10 – 0.5V1Ω + 0.2 – 0.2VOC = 2
Or, 0.8V – 0.6V1Ω = 12 + 0.2VOC
Or, 0.8 V – 0.2VOC = 12 +3=15 (Putting V1Ω = 5)
Again, \(\frac{V_{OC}-V}{5}\) + 2 = 5
Or, 0.2VOC – 0.2V = 3
Again, RTH = {(10||2) + 1} + 5
= (\(\frac{20}{12+1}\)) + 5 = 7.67 Ω
Following the theorem of maximum power transfer, R = RTH = 7.67 Ω
And PMAX = \(\frac{V_{OC}^2}{4R} = \frac{45^2}{4×7.67}\) = 66 W.
9. In the circuit given below, the value of RL for which it absorbs maximum power is ___________
a) \(\frac{400}{3}\) Ω
b) \(\frac{2}{9}\) kΩ
c) 350.38 Ω
d) \(\frac{4}{9}\) kΩ
c
Or, I = \(\frac{5}{100}\) = 0.05 A
VOC = 100 × 3I + 200 × I = 25 V
V1 = \(\frac{\frac{5}{50}}{\frac{1}{50} + \frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{100}} \) 
= \(\frac{0.1}{0.02+0.005+0.01} \) 
= 2.85 V
I = \(\frac{2.85}{100}\) = 0.0142 A = 14.2 mA
ISC = \(\frac{2.85}{100}\) + 3 × 0.0142 = 0.07135 A
∴ RTH = \(\frac{V_{OC}}{I_{SC}}  = \frac{25}{0.07135}\) = 350.38 Ω.
10. The form factor of sinusoidal alternating electric current is ___________
a) 0
b) 1
c) 1.11
d) 1.15
c
Now the rms value of alternating electric current = 0.07 × maximum value of alternating current.
Average value of alternating electric current = 0.637 × maximum value of alternating current.
∴ Form factor = \(\frac{0.707}{0.637}\) = 1.11.
11. The average power delivered to the 6 Ω load in the circuit of figure below is ___________
a) 8 W
b) 76.68 W
c) 625 kW
d) 2.50 kW
b
V1 = 5V2
50 = 400(I1 – 0.04V2) + V1
Or, V2  = 21.45 V
∴ PL = \(\frac{V_2^2}{6} \) 
= \(\frac{21.45^2}{6} \) 
= \(\frac{460.1025}{6}\) = 76.68 W.
12. The rms value of the sine wave is 100 A. Its peak value is ____________
a) 70.7 A
b) 141.4 A
c) 150 A
d) 282.8 A
b
So the peak value = rms value of alternating electric current × peak factor of alternating electric current = 100 × 1.414 = 141.4 A.
13. Potential of earth is – 50 V. If the potential difference between anode and cathode (earthed) is measured as 150 V, actual voltage on anode is __________
a) 0 V
b) 100 V
c) 200 V
d) 250 V
c
So, actual voltage on anode, V = 150 – (- 50)
= 150 + 50
= 200 V.
14. An alternating voltage V = 150 sin(314)t is supplied to a device which offers a resistance of 20 Ω in forward direction of electric current while preventing the flow of electric current in reverse direction. The form factor is ___________
a) 0.57
b) 0.318
c) 1.414
d) 1.57
d
RMS value of the current, Irms = Im / 2 = 7/2 = 3.5 A
Average value of the current, Iavg = Im / π = 2.228 A
Form factor = Irms / Iavg = 3.5 / 2.228 = 1.57.
15. A coil of 300 turns is wound on a non-magnetic core having a mean circumference of 300 mm and a cross sectional area of 300 mm2. The inductor of the coil corresponding to a magnetizing electric current of 3 A will be?
a) 37.68 μH
b) 47.68 μH
c) 113.04 μH
d) 120.58 μH
c
= \(\frac{4π X 10^{-7}  X 300 X 300 X 300 X 10^{-6}}{300 X 10^{-3}}\) 
= 113.04 μH.
