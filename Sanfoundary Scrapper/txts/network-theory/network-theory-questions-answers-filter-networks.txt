6. The expression of the characteristic impedance of a symmetrical T-section is?
a) ZOT=√(Z12/4-Z1Z2)
b) ZOT=√(Z12/4+Z1)
c) ZOT=√(Z12/4+Z2)
d) ZOT=√(Z12/4+Z1Z2)
d
Zin=(Z1/2)+(Z2((Z1/2)+Zo))/((Z1/2)+Z2+Zo) and Zin=Zo. On solving, the expression of the characteristic impedance of a symmetrical T-section is ZOT=√(Z12/4+Z1Z2).

c) Zsc=(Z12-4Z1Z2)/(2Z1+4Z2)
d) Zsc=(Z12+4Z1Z2)/(2Z1-4Z2)
b
9. The relation between ZOT, Zoc, Zsc is?
a) ZOT=√ZocZsc
b) Zoc=√(ZOT Zsc)
c) Zsc=√(ZOT Zoc)
d) Zoc=√(ZOT Zoc)
