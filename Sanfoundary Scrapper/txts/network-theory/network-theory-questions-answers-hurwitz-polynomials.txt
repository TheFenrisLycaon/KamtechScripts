1. The denominator polynomial in a transfer function may not have any missing terms between the highest and the lowest degree, unless?
a) all odd terms are missing
b) all even terms are missing
c) all even or odd terms are missing
d) all even and odd terms are missing
c
2. The roots of the odd and even parts of a Hurwitz polynomial P (s) lie on ____________
a) right half of s plane
b) left half of s-plane
c) on jω axis
d) on σ axis
c
3. If the polynomial P (s) is either even or odd, then the roots of P (s) lie on __________
a) on σ axis
b) on jω axis
c) left half of s-plane
d) right half of s plane
b
4. If the ratio of the polynomial P (s) and its derivative gives a continued fraction expansion with ________ coefficients, then the polynomial P (s) is Hurwitz.
a) all negative
b) all positive
c) positive or negative
d) positive and negative
b
5. Consider the polynomial P(s)=s4+3s2+2. The given polynomial P (s) is Hurwitz.
a) True
b) False
a
After doing the continued fraction expansion, we get all the quotients as positive. So, the polynomial P (s) is Hurwitz.

a) left half of s-plane only
b) right half of s-plane only
c) left half of s-plane or on imaginary axis
d) right half of s-plane or on imaginary axis
c
8. For real roots of sk, all the quotients of s in s2+ωk2 of the polynomial P (s) are __________
a) negative
b) non-negative
c) positive
d) non-positive
b
9. The real parts of the driving point function Z (s) and Y (s) are?
a) positive and zero
