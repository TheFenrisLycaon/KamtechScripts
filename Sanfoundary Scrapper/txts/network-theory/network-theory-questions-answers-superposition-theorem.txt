c
3. In the circuit shown, find the current through 4Ω resistor using Superposition theorem.
a) 4
b) 5
c) 6
d) 7
b
Now current through 3Ω resistor is   20/(5+4)=2.22A.
Now considering the current source 5A, 20V voltage source is short circuited.
No current through 3Ω resistor is  5 × 5/(4+5)=2.78A. Now finally the current through 3Ω resistor is 2.22 + 2.78 = 5A.
4. Consider the circuit shown below. Find the voltage across 2Ω resistor due to the 10V voltage source using Superposition theorem.
a) 0
b) 1
c) 2
d) 3
b
Voltage at node A is (V-10)/10+V/20+V/7=0 => V=3.41V. => The voltage across 2Ω resistor is   V/(7)×2=0.97V≅1V.
5. Find the voltage across 2Ω resistor due to 20V source in the following figure.
a) -2.92
b) 2.92
c) 1.92
d) -1.92
a
The voltage at node A is (V-20)/7+V/20+V/10=0 => V = 9.76V. Now the voltage across 2Ω resistor is (V-20)/7×2=-2.92V.
6. Find the voltage across 2Ω resistor due to 2A source in the following figure.
a) -1
b) 1
c) 1.46
d) -1.46
d
The current through 2Ω resistor is 2× 5/(5+8.67)=0.73A. The voltage across 2Ω resistor is -0.73×2 = -1.46V.
7. In the figure shown below. Find the voltage across 2Ω resistor due to all source using Superposition theorem.
a) 3.41
b) -3.41
c) 3.14
d) -3.14
b

d) 2.5
b
(V-20)/20+V/2+V/10=0 => V=1.5V.
9. Find the voltage across 2Ω resistor due to 20V source in the following circuit.
a) 0.5
b) 0
c) 1
d) 1.5
d
(V-10)/10+V/20+V/2=0 => V=1.5V.
