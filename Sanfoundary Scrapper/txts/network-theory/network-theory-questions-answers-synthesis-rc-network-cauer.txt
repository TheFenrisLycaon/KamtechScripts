1. Consider the impedance functionZ(s)=(s2+6s+8)/(s2+3s). Find the value of R1 after performing the first Cauer form.
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
a
On performing this we get the first quotient is 1Ω.
So, R1 = 1Ω.
2. Consider the impedance functionZ(s)=(s2+6s+8)/(s2+3s). Find the first reminder obtained by taking the continued fraction expansion after performing the first Cauer form.
a) s + 8
b) 2s + 8
c) 3s + 8
d) 4s + 8
c
3. Consider the impedance functionZ(s)=(s2+6s+8)/(s2+3s). Find the value of R2 after performing the first Cauer form.
a) 4
b) 3
c) 6
d) 9
d
So the value of R2 is 9Ω.
R2 = 9Ω.
4. Consider the impedance functionZ(s)=(s2+6s+8)/(s2+3s). Find the value of C1 after performing the first Cauer form.
a) 1/4
b) 1/3
c) 1/2
d) 1
b
So the value of C1 is 1/3 F.
C1 = 1/3 F.
5. Consider the impedance functionZ(s)=(s2+6s+8)/(s2+3s). Find the value of C2 after performing the first Cauer form.
a) 1/6
b) 1/12
c) 1/24
d) 1/48
c
So the value of C2 is 1/24 F.
C2 = 1/24 F.
6. Consider the impedance function Z(s)=(s2+6s+8)/(s2+3s). Find the value of C1 after performing the second Cauer form.
a) 1/2
b) 3/8
c) 1/4
d) 1/8
b
C1 = 3/8 F.
