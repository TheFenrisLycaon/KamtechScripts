12. Apply factorization method for solving the following equations.
3x + 2y + 7z = 4
2x + 3y + z = 5
3x + 4y + z = 7
a) z = -1/3, y = 8/3, x = 7/8
b) z = -5/3, y = 4/3, x = 7/8
c) z = 7/3, y = 8/3, x = 9/8
d) z = -1/3, y = 1/3, x = 5/8
a
Let \(\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\a&1&0\\b&c&1\end{bmatrix}\)\(\begin{bmatrix}p&q&r\\0&s&t\\0&0&u\end{bmatrix}\) = \(\begin{bmatrix}3&2&7\\2&3&1\\3&4&1\end{bmatrix}\) 
p = 3, q = 2, r = 7
ap = 2, aq + s = 3, ar + t = 1
bp = 3, bq + cs = 4, br + ct + u = 1
By solving these equations, we get
a = 2/3
b = 1
s = 5/3
c = 6/5
t = -11/3
u = -8/5
Thus, A =\(\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\2/3&1&0\\1&6/5&1\end{bmatrix}\)\(\begin{bmatrix}3&2&7\\0&5/3&-11/3\\0&0&-8/5\end{bmatrix}\) .
Writing UX = V, the given system becomes
\(\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\2/3&1&0\\1&6/5&1\end{bmatrix}\)\(\begin{bmatrix}i\\j\\k\end{bmatrix}\) = \(\begin{bmatrix}4\\5\\7\end{bmatrix}\) 
Solving these equations, we have i = 4
(2/3)i + j = 5 or j = 7/3
i + (6/5)j + k = 7 or k = 1/5
Hence, the original system becomes,
\(\begin{bmatrix}3&2&7\\0&5/3&-11/3\\0&0&-6/5\end{bmatrix}\)\(\begin{bmatrix}4\\5\\7\end{bmatrix}\) = \(\begin{bmatrix}4\\7/3\\1/5\end{bmatrix}\) 
3x + 2y + 7z = 4
(5/3y) – 11/3z = 7/3
-8/5z = 1/5
By back substitution, we have
z = -1/3, y = 8/3, x = 7/8.
13. Apply factorization method for solving the following equations.
2x + 3y + z = 9
x + 2y + 3z = 6
3x + y + 2z = 8
a) z = 1/2, y = 1/2, x = 7/2
b) z = 5/2, y = 1/2, x = 9/2
c) z = 7/2, y = 3/2, x = 3/2
d) z = 1/2, y = 5/2, x = 3/2
a
Let \(\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\a&1&0\\b&c&1\end{bmatrix}\)\(\begin{bmatrix}p&q&r\\0&s&t\\0&0&u\end{bmatrix}\) =  \(\begin{bmatrix}2&3&1\\1&2&3\\3&1&2\end{bmatrix}\) 
p = 2, q = 3, r = 1
ap = 1, aq + s = 2, ar + t = 3
bp = 3, bq + cs = 1, br + ct + u = 2
By solving these equations, we get
a = 1/2
b = 3/2
s = 1/2
t = 5/2
c = -7
u = 18
Thus, A = \(\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\1/2&1&0\\3/2&-7&1\end{bmatrix}\)\(\begin{bmatrix}2&3&1\\0&1/2&5/2\\0&0&18\end{bmatrix}\)  
Writing UX = V, the given system of equations become
\(\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\1/2&1&0\\3/2&-7&1\end{bmatrix}\)\(\begin{bmatrix}i\\j\\k\end{bmatrix}\) = \(\begin{bmatrix}9\\6\\8\end{bmatrix}\)  
i = 9
(1/2) i + j = 6
(3/2) i – 7j + k = 8
By back substitution,
i = 9, j = 3/2, k = 5
Hence, the original system becomes
\(\begin{bmatrix}2&3&1\\0&1/2&5/2\\0&0&18\end{bmatrix}\)   \(\begin{bmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{bmatrix}\) = \(\begin{bmatrix}9\\3/2\\5\end{bmatrix}\)  
2x + 3y + z = 9
(1/2) y + (5/2) z = 3/2
10z = 5
z = 1/2
By back substitution,
z = 1/2, y = 1/2, x = 7/2.
14. While solving a system of linear equations, which of the following will be the order of the decomposed matrices; L and U?
a) Order of L = 3X1, Order of U = 1X3
b) Order of L = 3X2, Order of U = 2X3
c) Order of L = 3X3, Order of U = 3X3
d) Order of L = 3X4, Order of U = 4X3
c
