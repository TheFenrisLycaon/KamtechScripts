1. The value of y’/x’ in terms of the angle 0 is given by _____________
a) tanθ
b) secθ
c) cotθ
d) cosecθ
a
2. The Newton Raphson method is also called as ____________
a) Tangent method
b) Secant method
c) Chord method
d) Diameter method
a
3. The equation f(x) is given as x2-4=0. Considering the initial approximation at x=6 then the value of x1 is given as ____________
a) 10/3
b) 4/3
c) 7/3
d) 13/3
a
x(1)=x(0)+\(\frac{f(x(0))}{f’x(x(0))}\).
Hence x0=6 (initial guess), f(x0)=32 and f’(x0)=12.
Substituting the values in the equation we get x1= 10/3.
4. For decreasing the number of iterations in Newton Raphson method:
a) The value of f’(x) must be increased
b) The value of f’’(x) must be decreased
c) The value of f’(x) must be decreased
d) The value of f’’(x) must be increased
a
x(1)=x(0)+\(\frac{f(x(0))}{f’x(x(0))}\).
Hence if f’(x) decreases the value of next iteration approaches the initial one. This decreases the number of iterations in finding out next iterative value.
5. In Newton Raphson method f’(x) for a given point is given by the formula ____________
a) y/x’
b) y’/x
c) y/x
d) y’/x’
d
6. If f(x) = x2-117 = 0 then the iterative formula for Newton Raphson Method is given by ____________
a) x(n+1)=0.25 [x(n)+\(\frac{166}{x(n)}\)] 
b) x(n+1)=0.5 [x(n)+\(\frac{166}{x(n)}\)] 
c) x(n+1)=0.5 [x(n)-\(\frac{166}{x(n)}\)] 
d) x(n+1)=0.25 [x(n)-\(\frac{166}{x(n)}\)] 
b
Where N=117. Hence x(n+1)=0.5 [x(n)+\(\frac{117}{x(n)}\)]. 
7. The points where the Newton Raphson method fails are called?
a) floating
b) continuous
c) non-stationary
d) stationary
d
8. The convergence of which of the following method depends on initial assumed value?
a) False position
b) Gauss Seidel method
c) Newton Raphson method
d) Euler method
c
x(1)=x(0)+\(\frac{f(x(0))}{f’x(x(0))}\). Hence it depends on the initial value x0.
9. The equation f(x) is given as x3+4x+1=0. Considering the initial approximation at x=1 then the value of x1 is given as _______________
a) 1.67
b) 1.87
c) 1.86
d) 1.85
c
x(1)=x(0)+\(\frac{f(x(0))}{f’x(x(0))}\) 
Hence x0=1 (initial guess), f(x0)=6 and f’(x0)= 7.
Substituting the values in the equation we get x1=1.857 which is 1.86 rounded to 2 decimal places.
