1. Rate of convergence of the Newton-Raphson method is generally __________
a) Linear
b) Quadratic
c) Super-linear
d) Cubic
a
2. The equation f(x) is given as x3 – x2 + 4x – 4 = 0. Considering the initial approximation at x=2 then the value of next approximation correct upto 2 decimal places is given as __________
a) 0.67
b) 1.33
c) 1.00
d) 1.50
b
x(1)=x(0)+\(\frac{f(x(0))}{f’x(x(0))}.\) 
Hence x0=2 (initial guess), f(x0)=8 and f’(x0)=12.
Substituting the values in the equation we get x1=1.33 
3. The Newton-Raphson method of finding roots of nonlinear equations falls under the category of which of the following methods?
a) bracketing
b) open
c) random
d) graphical
b
4. The Iterative formula for Newton Raphson method is given by __________
a) x1 = x0-f(x0)/f’(x0)
b) x0 = x1-f(x0)/f‘(x0)
c) x0 = x1+f(x0)/f’(x0)
d) x1 = x0+f(x0)/f‘(x0)
a
5. If f(x) = x2 – 153 = 0 then the iterative formula for Newton Raphson Method is given by __________
a) x(n+1) = 0.5 [x(n)+\(\frac{153}{x(n)}\)] 
b) x(n+1) = 0.5 [x(n)-\(\frac{153}{x(n)}\)] 
c) x(n+1) = [x(n)+\(\frac{153}{x(n)}\)] 
d) x(n+1) = [x(n)-\(\frac{153}{x(n)}\)] 
a
Where N=117. Hence x(n+1)=0.5 [x(n)+\(\frac{117}{x(n)}\)].

6. In Newton Raphson method if the curve f f(x) is constant then __________
a) f’’(x)=0
b) f(x)=0
c) f’(x)=0
d) f’(x)=c
c
7. For what values of 0 the initial guess will be equal to the next iterative values?
a) 70 degrees
b) 90 degrees
c) 100 degrees
d) 55 degrees
b
8. The equation f(x) is given as x2-4=0. Considering the initial approximation at x=6 then the value of next approximation correct upto 2 decimal places is given as __________
a) 3.33
b) 1.33
c) 2.33
d) 4.33
a
x(1)=x(0)+\(\frac{f(x(0))}{f’x(x(0))}\).
Hence x0=6 (initial guess), f(x0)=32 and f’(x0)=12.
Substituting the values in the equation we get x1=3.33.
9. At which point the iterations in the Newton Raphson method are stopped?

d) When the consecutive iterative values of x are equal
d

a) f’(x0)=0
b) f’’(x0)=0
c) f(x0)=0
d) f’’’(x0)=0
