\(X3 = \frac{0.673346865}{1+0.059251749}\)=0.635681617; f(x3) = -0.018736045
Therefore, x3 becomes b to find the next point.
\(X4 = \frac{0.635691617}{1+0.018736045}\)=0.623990502; f(x4) = -5.610588465*10-3
Therefore, x4 becomes b to find the next point.
\(X5 = \frac{0.623990502}{1+(5.610588465*10^{-3})}\)=0.62050908; f(x5) = -1.652615179*10-3
Therefore x5 becomes b to find the next point.
\(X6 = \frac{0.62050908}{1+(1.652615179*10^{-3})}\)=0.619485309; f(x6) = -4.844127073*10-4
Therefore x6 becomes b to find the next point.
\(X7 = \frac{0.619485309}{1+(4.844127073*10^{-4})}\)= 0.619195367; f(x7) = -1.417874765*10-4
Therefore x7 becomes b to find the next point.
\(X8 = \frac{0.619195367}{1+(1.417874765*10^{-4})}\)=0.619097586; f(x8) = -4.14829789*10-5
Therefre x8 becomes b to find the next point.
\(X9 = \frac{0.619097586}{1+(4.14828789*10^{-5})}\)=0.619071905
Therefore, the positive root corrected to 4 decimal places is 0.6190.
