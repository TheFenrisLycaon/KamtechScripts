11. If approximate solution of the set of equations, 2x+2y-z = 6, x+y+2z = 8 and -x+3y+2z = 4, is given by x = 2.8 y = 1 and z = 1.8. Then, what is the exact solution?
a) x = 3 , y = 1 , z =2
b) x = 1 , y = 2 , z =2
c) x = 2 , y = 3 , z = 1
d) x = 1 , y = 3 , z = 2
a
2(2.8) + 2(1) – 1.8 = 5.8 …………..(i)
2.8 + 1 + 2(1.8) = 7.4 ……………..(ii)
-2.8 +3(1) + 2(1.8) = 3.8 …………..(iii)
Subtracting each equation (i), (ii), (iii) from the corresponding given equations we obtain
2xe + 2ye – ze = 0.2 …………….(iv)
Xe + ye +2ze = 0.6 ………………(v)
-xe + 3ye + 2ze = 0.2 ……………(vi)
Where xe = x – 2.8, ye = y – 1, ze = z = 1.8.
Solving the equations (iv), (v), (vi), we get xe = 0.2, ye = 0, ze = 0.2.
This gives the better solution x = 3, y = 1, z = 2, which incidentally is the exact solution.
12. 1.01x + 2y and x + 2y = 2 is well conditioned set of linear equations.
a) True
b) False
b
Now consider the system x + 2.01y = 2.04 and x + 2y = 2 which has the solution x = -6 and y = 4.
Hence the system is ill conditioned.
13. How can we avoid instability?
a) Reformulation of problem suitably
b) Making small changes in the coefficients of equations
c) Choosing the method involving higher computations
d) Rounding off the errors
