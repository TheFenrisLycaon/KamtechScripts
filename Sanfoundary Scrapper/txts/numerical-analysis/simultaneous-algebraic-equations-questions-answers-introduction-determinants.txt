a) a1 b1
b) a1 b2
c) a2 b1
d) a2 b2
b
2. For a determinant \(\begin{vmatrix}a&b&c\\d&e&f\\g&h&i\end{vmatrix}\), the cofactor of h will be equal to which of the following?
a) (-1)3+2 \(\begin{vmatrix}a&c\\d&f\end{vmatrix}\) 
b) (-1)3+2 \(\begin{vmatrix}d&f\\g&i\end{vmatrix}\) 
c) (-1)3+2 \(\begin{vmatrix}a&c\\g&i\end{vmatrix}\) 
d) (-1)3+2 \(\begin{vmatrix}b&c\\e&f\end{vmatrix}\) 
a
3. What is the value of the determinant \(\begin{pmatrix}2&5&1\\7&4&5\\1&2&3\end{pmatrix}\)?
a) -56
b) -96
c) -66
d) -85
c
= 2(12-10) – 5(21-5) + 1(14-4)
= -66.
4. A determinant vanishes if one of the entire row or column consists of all zero elements?
a) True
b) False
b
5. If each element of a line consists of m terms, the determinant can be expressed as the sum of ______ determinants.
a) m-1
b) m
c) m+1
d) m2
b
6. Consider the set P of all determinants of order 3 with entries 0 or 1 only. Let Q the subset of P consisting of all determinants with value 1.
Let R be the subset of P consisting of all determinants with value – 1. Then, which of the following is true?
a) R is empty
b) Q has as many elements as R
c) P = Q ∪ R
d) Q has twice as many elements as R
b
Similarly, we found that the number of determinants with value 1 are like \(\begin{bmatrix}1&0&1\\1&1&0\\0&1&0\end{bmatrix}\) are equal to the number of determinants with value -1 \(\begin{bmatrix}1&1&1\\1&0&0\\0&0&1\end{bmatrix}\).

c) If we swap two columns in A, |A| does not change sign
d) If we divide a matrix with a scalar, division occurs only in a single row or column
a
9. If A and B are two square matrices, then |A.B| is same as which of the following?
a) |A|.|B|
b) |B|.|A|
