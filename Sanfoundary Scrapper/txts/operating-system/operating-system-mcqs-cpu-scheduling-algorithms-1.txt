b) use minimal resources
c) use many resources
d) all of the mentioned
a
5. What is FIFO algorithm?
a) first executes the job that came in last in the queue

c) first executes the job that needs minimal processor
d) first executes the job that has maximum processor needs
b
6. The strategy of making processes that are logically runnable to be temporarily suspended is called ____________
a) Non preemptive scheduling
b) Preemptive scheduling
c) Shortest job first
d) First come First served
b
7. What is Scheduling?
a) allowing a job to use the processor

d) none of the mentioned
a
8. There are 10 different processes running on a workstation. Idle processes are waiting for an input event in the input queue. Busy processes are scheduled with the Round-Robin time sharing method. Which out of the following quantum times is the best value for small response times, if the processes have a short runtime, e.g. less than 10ms?
a) tQ = 15ms
b) tQ = 40ms
c) tQ = 45ms
d) tQ = 50ms
a
9. Orders are processed in the sequence they arrive if _______ rule sequences the jobs.
a) earliest due date
b) slack time remaining
c) first come, first served
d) critical ratio
c
10. Which of the following algorithms tends to minimize the process flow time?
a) First come First served
b) Shortest Job First
c) Earliest Deadline First
d) Longest Job First
b
11. Under multiprogramming, turnaround time for short jobs is usually ________ and that for long jobs is slightly ___________
a) Lengthened; Shortened
b) Shortened; Lengthened
c) Shortened; Shortened
d) Shortened; Unchanged
b
12. Which of the following statements are true? (GATE 2010)

I. Shortest remaining time first scheduling may cause starvation
II. Preemptive scheduling may cause starvation
III. Round robin is better than FCFS in terms of response time
a) I only
b) I and III only
c) II and III only
d) I, II and III
d
II) Preemption may cause starvation. If priority based scheduling with preemption is used, then a low priority process may never get CPU.
III) Round Robin Scheduling improves response time as all processes get CPU after a specified time.
