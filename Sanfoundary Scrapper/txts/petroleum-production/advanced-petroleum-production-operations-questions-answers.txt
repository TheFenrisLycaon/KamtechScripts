4. How does reduced absolute permeability results in the formation damage mechanism?
a) Results from plugging of pore channels by induced or inherent particles
b) Results from an increase in water saturation or oil wetting of the rock
c) Results due to a decrease in water saturation
d) Results due to a decrease in gas saturation
