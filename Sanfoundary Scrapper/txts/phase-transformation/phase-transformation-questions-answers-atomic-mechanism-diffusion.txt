2. Which of the following atoms use the vacancy mechanism to diffuse?
a) Large atoms
b) Surface atoms
c) Substitutional atoms
d) Small interstitial atoms
c
3. Vibrational energy is increased by increasing the amplitude of the oscillations.
a) True
b) False
c
4. When considering the flux of particles (atoms, molecules, ions etc.) in a one-dimensional system caused by a concentration gradient, the flux can be expressed as ____________
a) J = dm/dt
b) J = dm/(dt*A)
c) J = dm/dx
d) J = dm/(dx*A)
b
Where J (mol/m2 s) is the flux, dm (mol) is the change in the amount of matter in small time dt (seconds), A (m2) is the area, D (m2/s) is the diffusion coefficient, C (mol/m3) is the concentration of the particles, and x (m) is the position parameter. The negative sign stems from the fact that diffusion occurs in the direction opposite to the increasing concentration gradient.

a) True
b) False
b

a) a/√2
b) a/2
c) 3a/√2
d) 2a
a

a) Melting point of carbon
b) C atom strain Fe lattice
c) Melting point of Fe atom
d) Shrinking of C atom
b
