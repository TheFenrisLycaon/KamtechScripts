4. For a particular or given diffusion coefficient, which among the following interface moves the slowest?
a) Coherent
b) Semi coherent
c) Incoherent
d) Mixed
a
5. If the α/β(α,β are phases) interfacial energy is given as 10N/mm and the particles are spherical with a radius 2.5mm, ΔP (extra pressure due to curvature of α/β) is given approximately by_________
a) 8 N/mm2
b) 4 N/mm2
c) 3 N/mm2
d) 2 N/mm2
a
6. There is an increase in free energy due to interfacial energy is known as a capillarity effect or the Gibbs-Thomson effect. Find the increase in this free energy if the interfacial energy, the molar volume and the radius of the spherical particle are given as 10 (kJ/mm2), 6mm3/mol and 4mm respectively?
a) 40 kJmol-1
b) 30 kJmol-1
c) 50 kJmol-1
d) 60 kJmol-1
b
G = (2γV)/r
Hence substituting this value of interfacial energy, molar volume and radius in the equation we get the increase in energy as (2*10*6)/4 = 30 kJmol-1.
