9. The nature of normal grain growth in the presence of a second phase deserves special consideration. The moving boundaries will be attached to the particles exert a pulling force on the boundary restricting its motion. Therefore if the boundary intersects the particle surface at 90° the particle will feel a pull of (2πrγcosΘ)*sinΘ. This will be counterbalanced by an equal and opposite force acting on the boundary.
