1. Which among the following plane has the least density of atoms?
a) {110}
b) {200}
c) {220}
d) {111}
c
2. If 1 mol of solid is vaporized 12Na broken bonds are formed. Therefore L (Latent heat of sublimation) = 12 Na*E/2(E is the bond strength of metal). Consequently the energy of a {111} surface is given as ___
a) 0.50*L/Na (J/surface atoms)
b) 0.75*L/Na (J/surface atoms)
c) 0.25*L/Na (J/surface atoms)
d) 1.25*L/Na (J/surface atoms)
b
3. Surface free energy is given by_____
a) γ= E +PV+TS
b) γ= E +PV/TS
c) γ= E +PV*TS
d) γ= E +PV-TS
a
Here even if the ‘PV’ term is ignored surface entropy effects must be taken into account. It might be expected that the surface atoms will have more freedom of movement.
4. Considering the nearest neighbours it can be seen that the atoms on a {111} surface, for example, are deprived of three of their twelve neighbours.
a) True
b) False
a
5. Extra configurational entropy can also be introduced into the surface by the formation of surface vacancies. Entropy effects γ is slightly dependent on temperature and is given as, γ = -2T+2. Calculate the entropy S from the given condition?
a) T
b) -2
c)  2
d) T2
b

b) Marks construction
c) Henrys diagram
d) Twin diagram
d
11. A convenient method for plotting the variation of γ with surface orientation in three dimensions is to construct a surface about an origin such that the free energy of any plane is equal to the distance between the surface and the origin when measured along the normal to the plane.
