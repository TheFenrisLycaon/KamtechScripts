d
9. The quantum of energy in an elastic wave is called a ___________
a) Debye model
b) Sonar

10. What happens to the entropy in a system with constant volume and constant internal energy during a spontaneous process?
a) Remains same
b) Decreases
c) Increases
d) First decreases then increases
b
In the Clausius inequality when we apply the above mentioned condition, finally we get the equation which states that the entropy in a system decreases when the volume and internal energy remains constant during a spontaneous process.
