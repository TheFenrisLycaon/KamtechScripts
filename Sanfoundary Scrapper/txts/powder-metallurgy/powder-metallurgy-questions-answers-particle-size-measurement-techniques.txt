d) Packing density
a
9. _______ establishes the relationship between the settling velocity of falling particles and particle size.
a) Hess law
b) Continuity equation
c) Stoke’s law
d) Bernoulli’s equation
c
10. The laboratory methods for sizing by _________ can be divided into fractionating and non-fractionation groups.
a) Elutriation method

b
11. In Tyler standard screen scale, sieve series having a ratio of ______ is used.
a) \(\sqrt{3}\) : 1
b) \(\sqrt{2}\) : 1
c) \(\sqrt{2}\) : 2
d) \(\sqrt[4]{3}\) : 1
b
12. ________ is the particle size through square grid method where magnification of the objective is x10.
a) 0.259 mm
b) 0.282 mm
c) 0.156 mm
d) 2.963 mms
b
d=\(\frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{\pi \times magnification \, of \, objective}}\) where, x=Number of squares x Area of 1 square and d=particle diameter
Thus, from the above figure: 100% square=6; 75% square=2; 50% square=4 and 25% square=2. Hence, x=10 x 0.25=2.5. Therefore, d=\(\frac{\sqrt{2.5}}{\sqrt{\pi \times 10}}\)=0.282mm.
13.________ is the particle size through linear/ horizontal scale method where magnification of the objective is x10.
a) 0.21mm
b) 2.10mm
c) 0.20mm
d) 0.22mm
a
d=\(\frac{number \, of \, division \times L.C}{magnification \, of \, objective}\) where, number of division=last – start point and L.C=least count=0.1mm
Thus, from the above figure: number of division=56-35=21
Hence, d=\(\frac{21 \times 0.1}{10}\)=0.21mm.
14. The below figure represents the relative size distribution graph.
a) True
b) False
a
