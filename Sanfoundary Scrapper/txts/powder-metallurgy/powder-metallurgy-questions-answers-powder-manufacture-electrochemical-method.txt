a
8. _____ is used to calculate theoretical weight deposited on the electrode.
a) Faraday’s law
b) Hess law
c) De-Braggs law
d) Stoke’s law
a
9. Time and current are the two important variables which affect the amount of powder deposited on the electrode during electrodeposition of copper.
a) True
b) False
a
10. What is the current density when current of 1.5A flows through the electrolytic cell with the cathode plate having an effective length of 46mm, breadth 38mm and negligible thickness?
a) 413.7 A/m2
b) 377.9 A/m2
c) 519.3 A/m2
d) 403.6 A/m2
a
Here, current=1.5A and effective area of plate=2lw+2lt+wt
Given, l=46mm, b=38mm and t=1mm; effective area of plate=36.26x 10-4 m2
Substituting the values in equation (1), we get Current density=1.5 A/36.26 x 10-4 m2=413.7 A/m2.
11. What is the current efficiency when actual weight deposited is 0.036g and theoretical weight deposited is 0.049g?
a) 73.46%
b) 136.11%
c) 73.12%
d) 88.88%
a
Substituting the values in equation (1), we get
Current efficiency=\(\frac{0.036}{0.049}\) x 100=73.46%.
12. What is the theoretical amount of copper powder deposited on the cathode plate when a current of 1A passes through the electrolytic tank for 5 minutes?
a) 0.098g
b) 0.0016g
c) 0.190g
d) 0.980g
a
Faraday’s law is given by:
 Wth=I t A/F Nc————(1)
where, I the current in amperes, t is time in seconds, A is atomic weight of metal in grams/mole, F is Faradays constant=96500 C and Nc is the valency.
Substituting the values in equation (1), we get,
Wth=\(\frac{1 \times (5 \times 60) \times 63.5}{96500 \times 2}\)=0.098g.
