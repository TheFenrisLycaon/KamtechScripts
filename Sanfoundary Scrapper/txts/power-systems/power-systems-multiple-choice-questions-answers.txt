1. What is the value of charging current in short transmission lines?
a) Less than medium transmission lines
b) Equal to medium transmission lines
c) More than medium transmission lines
d) More than long transmission lines
c
2. What is the value of Inductive reactance in short transmission lines?
a) More at reciving end
b) More at sending end
c) Uniformly distributed over entire length
d) More in middle of sending end and reciving end
c
3. Regulation of short transmission lines depends:
a) Only on line resistance
b) Only on line inductance
c) Only on line capacitance
d) On line inductance and line resistance
d
4. What is the percentage voltage regulation of short transmission line if its sending end and reciving end voltages are 160 KV and 132 KV respectively?
a) 30 %
b) 21.21 %
c) 12.12 %
d) 38.22 %
b
                               = [( 160 – 132 ) × 100] ÷ 132
                               = 21.21 %.

5. A single phase transmission line is transmitting 1,100 KW power at 11 KV and at unity power fector. If it has a total resistance of 5 Ω, what is the efficiency of the transmission line?
a) 80 %
b) 89.65 %
c) 97.24 %
d) 99.54 %
c
 Line current (I) = P/V
                            = (1100 × 1000/11000)
                            = 100 Amp.
        Line losses = I2 R
                            = (100)2  5
                            = 50 KW
η = [11000/(11000+50)] × 100
   = 99.54 %.
6. Voltage regulation of a transmission line should be ________
