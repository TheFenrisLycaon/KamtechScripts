2.  For a string of five suspension insulators is to be fitted with a grading ring. If the pin to earth capacitances are equal to C, then the value of line to pin capacitance of first and last capacitance(from top) is
a) 0.25C, 4C
b) 0.667C, 3C
c) 1.5C, 1.5C
d) 4C,0.25
a
                       C1= 1*C/(5-1) = C/4
                      C4 = 4C/(5-4) = 4C.
