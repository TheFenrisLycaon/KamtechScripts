a) 445.5 kV
b) 890 kV
c) 630 kV
d) 223 kV
a
Voltage between the two outer conductors is √2*315 kV = 445.5 kV.
3. If a 2-wire ac single phase distribution system operating at ‘P’ MW and ‘V’ kV, operating at the power factor of 0.8, then the current in the outer wire  in  kA is ______
a) 0.8P/V
b) 1.131P/V
c) 1.88P/V
d) 0.088P/V
a
4.  If a 2-wire ac single phase distribution system operating at ‘30’ MW and ‘315’ kV, operating at the power factor of 0.8, then the current in the outer wire  in  kA is _____
a) 0.0838
b) 83.8
c) 8.38
d) 1.131
a
5. For a 2-wire ac single phase distribution system operating at ‘30’ MW and ‘315’ kV, operating at the power factor of 0.8 having 15Ω of resistance of each wire, then the copper loss at the substation in kW will be ___________
a) 210.67
b) 105.33
c) 240.87
d) 108.27
a
               Power losses = 2*I2*R = 2*83.822*15 = 210.673 kW.
6. For a 2-wire ac single phase distribution system operating at ‘30’ MW and ‘315’ kV, operating at the power factor of 0.8 having 15Ω of resistance of each wire, then the power received at the consumer end will be ____________
a) 29.79 MW
b) 29.895 MW
c) 29.76 MW
d) 29 MW
a
               Power losses = 2*I2*R = 2*83.822*15 = 210.673 kW
Power received = 30-210.67 = 29.79 MW.
7. For a 2-wire ac single phase distribution system operating at ‘P’ MW and ‘V’ kV, operating at the power factor of 0.8. The copper losses of the system will be proportional to ___________
a
