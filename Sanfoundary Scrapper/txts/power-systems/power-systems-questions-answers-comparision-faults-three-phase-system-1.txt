2. A three phase transformer has a name plate details of 30 MVA and voltage rating of 230Y kV/69∆ kV with a leakage reactance of 10% and the transformer connection via wye-delta. Taking a base of 230 kV on the high voltage side, the transformer reactance on the LV side is
___________
a) 176.33 Ω
b) 1763.3 Ω
c) 47.6 Ω
d) 15.87 Ω
a
                            Zb(HV)       = 2302/30=1763.33 Ω
XΩ =0.1*1763.33 = 176.33 Ω. 
3. A three phase transformer has a name plate details of 30 MVA and voltage rating of 230Y kV/69∆ kV with a leakage reactance of 10% and the transformer connection via wye-delta. Taking a base of 230 kV on the high voltage side, the transformer reactance referred to the low voltage side in ohms is __________
a) 47.61 Ω
b) 15.87 Ω
c) 176.33 Ω
d) 157.8 Ω
a
XΩ(HV) =0.1*1763.33 = 176.33 Ω
XΩ(LV) =176.33/(1.92452) = 47.61 Ω. 
4. A three phase transformer has a name plate details of 30 MVA and voltage rating of 230Y kV/69∆ kV with a leakage reactance of 10% and the transformer connection via wye-delta. Taking a base of 230 kV on the high voltage side, the transformer reactance referred to the low voltage side in ohms is
a) 0.1
b) 0.2
c) 0.198
d) 0.4
a
             = 176.33/(230/69)2 =15.87 Ω
Xpu= 15.87/158.7 = 0.1. 
5. A 200 bus power system has 160 PQ bus. For achieving a load flow solution by N-R in polar coordinates, the minimum number of simultaneous equation to be solved is ___________
a) 359
b) 329
c) 360
d) 320
a
PQ buses = 160
PV buses = 200-160 = 40
Slack bus = 1
Total number of equation = (40-1)*1 + (160*2) =  359.
6. Two alternators A and B  having 5% speed regulation are working in parallel at a station. Alternator  A is rated at 15 MW while B is at 20 MW. When the total load to be shared is 12 MW, then how  much of the load will be shared by the alternator B?
a) 6.85 MW
b) 5.14 MW
c) 6 MW
d) 7 MW
a
P2 α 20;
P1 = 0.75 P2   …(1)
P1 +P2 = 12   …(2)
Solving above, P2 = 6.85 MW.
7. Two alternators A and B  having 5% speed regulation are working in parallel at a station. Alternator  A is rated at 15 MW while B is at 20 MW. When the total load to be shared is 12 MW, then how  much of the load will be shared by the alternator B?
a) 6.85 MW
b) 5.14 MW
c) 6 MW
d) 7 MW
a
P2 α 20;
P1 = 0.75 P2   …(1)
P1 +P2 = 12   …(2)
Solving above equations, P1 = 5.14 MW. 
8. A 400 V, 50 Hz three phase balanced source ripples to a star connected load whose rating is S(=300+j400) kVA. The rating of the delta connected capacitor bank needed to bring p.f. to  0.9 lagging is _______ KVAR.

b) 25.4
c) 84.9
d) 284.5
a
=300[(4/3) – cos-10.9] = 254.72 kVAR.
