1. The synchronous machine is operating at a normal condition at the generating system, then the angle between rotor axis and the stator magnetic axis is  _____________
a) Load angle
b) Power factor angle
c) Impedance angle
d) None of the mentioned
a
2. The angle shown in the figure depends on which of the following given options?
a) Loading of the system
b) Power factor
c) Operating frequency
d) Power factor, operating frequency, loading of the system
a
3. Swing equation is very famous for describing the relation between the ___________
a) rotor motion and stator field
b) stator and rotor field
c) load angle and rotor field
d) moment of inertia and rotor motion
a
4. Swing equation which describes the relative motion of the rotor of the machine, is a __________
a) linear and second-order differential equation
b) non linear and second-order differential equation
c) non linear and first-order differential equation

a
6. Why the angle δ, rotor angle is famously called as the load angle in the equation of rotor dynamics?
a) Due to power exchange is a function of δ
b) Because it dictates the reactive power compensation
c) Due to load variations
d) No dependency on the load dynamics
a
