7. A three phase 50 Hz transmission line has flat horizontal spacing with 3.5 m between adjacent conductors. The conductors are No. 2/0 hard drawn copper (outside diameter = 1.05cm). The voltage f the line is 110 kV. The line charging current per conductor of the line is _____________
a) 0.085 A/km
b) 0.17 A/km
c) 0.12 A/km
d) 0.24 A/km
a
Cn = 0.00826 μF/km
Xn = 1/ωCn
Xn = 1/(100π* .284 *10-6)
Xn  = 0.384 x 106 Ω/km to neutral
Charging current = Vn/Xn
Charging current = (110/√3)*1000/(0.384 *106)
Charging current = 0.17 A/km
Charging current per conductor = I/2
 Charging current per conductor = 0.17/2
Charging current per conductor =  0.085 A/km. 
8. A three phase 50 Hz transmission line has flat horizontal spacing with 3.5 m between adjacent conductors. The conductors are No. 2/0 hard drawn copper (outside diameter = 1.05cm). The voltage f the line is 110 kV. The reactive volt amperes generated by the line is
a) 31.4 kVAR
b) 62.8 kVAR
c) 42 kVAR
d) 56 kVAR
a
Cn = 0.00826 μF/km
Xn = 1/ωCn
Xn = 1/(100π* .284 *10-6)
Xn  = 0.384 x 106 Ω/km to neutral
Reactive volt amperes generated by the line = (VL)2/Xc
     Reactive volt amperes generated by the line = 31.4 kVAR.
