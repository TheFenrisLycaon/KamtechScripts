a
5. Assume a 275 kV transmission line having the following line constants:A = 0.8∠5° ; B = 200∠75°
For obtaining 275 kV voltage at the receiving end obtaining unity power factor, the power transmitted will be _____________
a) 124 MW
b) 117.2 MW
c) 116 MW
d) 110 MW
a
0=(275*275)/200  sin⁡(75-δ)-0.8/200 sin⁡(75-5)
0=378sin⁡(75-δ)-284.26
δ=26.23°
Pr = (275*275)/200  cos⁡(75-δ)-0.8/200 cos⁡(75-5)
= 124 MW.

10. Assume a 275 kV transmission line having the following line constants:A = 0.85∠5° ; B = 200∠75°
If a load is connected at receiving end at unity power factor but maintaining the same voltage profile. The receiving end voltage if the compensation equipment is not installed will be __________
a) 245 kV
b) 280 kV
c) 255 kV
d) 272 kV
a
|Vs| = 275 kV, |Vr| = ?
150 = (275*|Vr|)/200  cos⁡(75-δ)-0.8/200 cos⁡(75-5)
0=(275*|Vr|)/200  sin⁡(75-δ)-0.8/200 sin⁡(75-5)
Solving the quadratic equations above and retaining the higher value for the voltage, |Vr| = 245 kV.
