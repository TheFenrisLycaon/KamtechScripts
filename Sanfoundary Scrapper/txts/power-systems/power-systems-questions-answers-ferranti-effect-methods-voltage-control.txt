1.  Ferranti effect is not a problem for ________
a) Long Transmission lines
b) Medium Transmission lines
c) Short Transmission lines
d) Transmission line having high capacitance
c
2. What happens during the Ferranti effect?
a) Reciving end current becomes more than sending end current
b) Reciving end voltage becomes more than sending end voltage
c) Reciving end power becomes more than sending end power
d) Reciving end frequency becomes more than sending end frequency
b
3. During Ferranti effect the voltage drop across line resistance  ___________
a) In phase with reciving end voltage
b) lags behind reciving end voltage
c) lead the reciving end voltage
d) lags behind sending end voltage
c
4. A transmission line of 200 Km is supplying at 50Hz frequency. What is the percentage rise in voltage at reciving end?
a) 20%
b) 1.2%
c) 2.19%
d) 20.8%
c
Solving this % Vrise = {(2 × Ω × 50) × 2002 × 10-8}/18
                                 = 2.19%.

b) ± 10 %
c) ± 5 %
d) ± 6 %
d
8. What is the main reason for maintaining consumer end voltage within prescribed limit?
a) Because it is declared by the supplier
b) For satisfactory operation of electrical equipments
c) For easy calculation of units supplied
d) To reduce the line losses
b
9. Which of the following equipment is not used for voltage control?
a) Tap changing transformer
b) Induction generators
c) Series compensators
d) Synchronous phase modifiers
b
10. What is the full form of AVR? This term is related to voltage control?
a) Automatic Voltage Rectifier
b) Actuated Voltage Rectifier

d) Automatic Voltage Regulator
d
11. On which side of the transformer tap changer is provided?
a) On High Voltage side
b) On low voltage side
c) On high voltage and low voltage side
d) In core
a
