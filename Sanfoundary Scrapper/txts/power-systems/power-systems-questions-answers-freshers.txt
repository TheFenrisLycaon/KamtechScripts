5. In the phasor diagram, the angle Фr such that zero voltage regulation occurs at the receiving end of a transmission line for a lagging load, is given as ___________
b
6. For a transmission line under study of failure analysis, it is observed that the current at the receiving end is same as that of the sending end, then what can be concluded about the nature of the transmission line?
a) It is short TL
b) It is medium TL

7. A single phase 50 hz, generator supplies an inductive load of 5 MW at a power factor of 0.8 lagging using OHTL over 20 km. The resistance and reactance are 0.39Ω and 3.96 Ω. The voltage at receiving station is maintained at 10 KV. The sending end voltage is ______
a) 11.68 kV
b) 7.62 kV
c) 14.4 kV
d) 12.2 kV
a
                        =625 A
                        Vs = |Vr|+|I|*(RcosФr + XsinФr)
                            = 10000+625(0.39*0.8+3.96*0.6)
                            = 11.68kV.
