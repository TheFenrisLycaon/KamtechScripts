a) The taxes which a power plant pay to Indian government
b) The taxes which a power plant pay to state government
c) The taxes which a Power Grid pay to Indian government
d) The schedule of rates are charged of supply of electricity for consumers
d
9. An electricity supplier is charging for the electricity as per the total load connected, fixed number of hours. This type of tariff will be a ___________
a) Simple tariff
b) Flat demand tariff
c) Flat rate tariff
d) Block rate tariff
b
10. Which statement about simple tariff is true?
a) Charges are made as per the total load connected and of fixed duration of use
b) Charges are made on the basis of units consumed in a certain period
c) Different types of consumers are charged differently
d) Charges per kilowatt decreases with increase in unit consumed
b
11. Identify the type of tariff the consumer is charged Rs 4 per unit if the consumer does not exceed 50 KWh, Rs 3.50 per unit if the consumer does not exceed 50 KWh but less than 200 kilowatt hour, and Rs 3 per KWh if consumer exceeds 200 kilowatt hour.
a) Flat demand tariff
b) Simple tariff
c) Flat rate tariff
d) Step rate tariff
d
12. What is demand factor of commercial consumers?
a) Low
b)  Low
c)  High
d) More than 1
c
13. If an industrial consumer consumes 50KW for 4 hours, 300KW for 15 hours and 60KW for 5 hours daily and the tariff rate is Rs 5/KWh. What is the energy consumption in a month of 30 days?
a) Rs 750000
b) Rs 475000
c) Rs 755000
d) Rs 470000
a
Energy Consumed in one month = 5000× 30
                 = 150000 KWh
Hence, Charge on one month = 150000 × 5
        =750000 Rupees.
14. Monthly consumption of a consumer is 500KWh. What will be the monthly bill at the following rate?
First 100 unit Rs 0.6/KWh
Next 100 units Rs 0.5/KWh
Remaining units Rs 0.4/KWh
a) Rs 250
b) Rs 25
c) Rs 230
d) Rs 23
c
Bill for one month consumption
= (100×0.6 + 100×0.5 + 300×0.4) Rupees
= 230 Rupees.
