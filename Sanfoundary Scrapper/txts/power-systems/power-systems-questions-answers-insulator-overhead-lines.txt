1. Which of the following material is not used for overhead line insulators?
a) Porcelain
b) Glass
c) PVC
d) Steatite
c
2. Pin type insulator are mostly subjected to which type of mechanical stress?
a) Compressive stress
b) Tensile stress
c) Both tensile and compressive stress
d) Twisting stress
d
3. Which of the following is the main field of application of pin type insulator?
a) Distribution system
b) Transmission system
c) Transmission and distribution system
d) EHV transmission system
a
4. Suspension type insulator are subjected to  ______________
a) tensile stress
b) compressive stress
c) tensile and compressive stress
d) depends on its use
a
5. A transmission line consists of 9 discs of suspension insulator in each string. What is the operating voltage of the transmission line?
a) 11 KV
b) 33 KV
c) 66 KV
d) 132 KV
d
6. Suspension insulator are made up of _____________
a) glass
b) porcelain
c) steatite
d) epoxy resin
b
7. Which of the following insulator is similar to pin type insulator?
a) Suspension insulator
b) Post insulator
c) Strain insulator
d) Shackle insulator
b
8. Which type of insulator is used where there is dead end of the line or there is a corner or a sharp curve, for high voltage line?
a) Pin type insulator
b) Shackle insulator
c) Strain insulator
d) Stay insulator
c
9. What is the most common cause of failure of overhead line insulators?
a) Flashover
b) Mechanical stress
c) Porosity of materials
d) Improper vitrification
a
10. If a string of suspension insulator has three units, each can withstand a maximum 11 KV and total string can withstand 25.76 KV. What is the string efficiency?
a) 234.1%
b) 46.3%
c) 68.75%
d) 78%
d
Where ‘n’ is number of units in one string
Hence, String Efficiency = [25.76/(3×11)] × 100
                                           = 78%.
11. Voltage distribution across disc of strings of suspension insulator assembly is ______
a) same for all disks
b) maximum for unit nearest to the line
c) maximum for unit nearest to the tower
d) equal to transmission line voltage rating
b
