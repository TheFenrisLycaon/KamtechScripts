6. The voltage rise happening at the receiving end due to the line charging capacitance has a magnitude of _______________
a) ω2CLl2
b) ω2CLl2/2
c) ω2l2/v2
d) ω2CLl2 and ω2l2/v2
d
Is= jVswCl
Vr = Vs – Is(jwLl) = Vs + Vsw2CLl2
=Vs(1+ w2CLl2). 
7. The receiving end voltage at the no load will be ____________
a) Vs(1+ w2CLl2)
b) (1+ w2CLl2)
c) Vs/(1+ w2CLl2)
d) Vs
a
Is= jVswCl
Vr = Vs – Is(jwLl) = Vs + Vsw2CLl2
=Vs(1+ w2CLl2).
