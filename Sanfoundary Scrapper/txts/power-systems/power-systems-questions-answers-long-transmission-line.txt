b) 50 Km
c) 120 Km
d) 200 Km
d
2. In long transmission lines Resistance and Capacitance parameters of lines are connected in __________

6. The voltage rating of long transmission line is _________
a) 20 KV to 100 KV
b) Upto 20 KV
c) Above 100 KV
d) 60 KV to 80 KV
c
7. The shunt capacitive susceptance in long transmission line is greater than that in medium and short transmission line.
a) True
b) False
a
8. What is the value of characteristics impedance for loss free transmission line?
a) √(L/C)
b) √(R/C)
c) √(LC)
d) √(C/L)
a
       Zc = √[(R+jX) / ( G+jB)]
For loss less transmission line resiatance (R) and shunt conductance (G)  are equal to zero. And hence, Z0 ( Characteristic impedance for loss-free transmission line) is given by
      Z0 = √(L/C). 
9. The leakage current through the shunt admittance is __________
a) Maximum at sending end
b) Maximum at receiving end
c) Uniform over length of line
d) Maximum at centre of line
a
10. Value of leakage current at reciving end of transmission line is zero.
a) True
b) False
a
