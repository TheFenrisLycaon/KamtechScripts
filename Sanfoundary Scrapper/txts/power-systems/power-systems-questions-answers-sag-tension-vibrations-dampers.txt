a) Sag decreases
b) Sag increases
c) Sag remains constant
d) Sag becomes zero
b
3. What is the relation between length of span and sag?
a) sag ∝ √span
b) sag ∝ (1/span)
c) sac ∝ span2
d) Sagar ∝ span3
c
4. What should be the value of sag for proper operation of overhead transmission line?
a) High
b) Low
c) Nither too low nor too high
d) Anything
c
5. An overhead transmission line has a span of 220 metres the conductor waiting 0.604 kg/m. What will be the maximum sag if the working tension is 2879 kg.
a) 8.96 m
b) 8.86 m
c) 8.85 m
d) 1.27 m
d
        (Maximum sag ) S = ωL2/8T
Where ,
             ω – weight of conductor per meter
              L – span
              T – Working tension
Therefore, S = (0.604×2202)/(8×2879)
                       = 1.269 m ~ 1.27 m. 
6. What is the value of working stress in overhead conductors?
a) Less than ultimate stress
b) More than ultimate stress
c) Always equal to ultimate stress
d) Should be zero
a
7. When the sag exceeds 10% of the span length, the shape made by the conductor is similar to which of the following  shape?
a) Hyperbola
b) Parabola
c) Catenary
d) Straight line
c
8. What will be the resultant weight on per meter of length of conductor if weight of conductor is 150 kg/m,  weight of ice in per meter of length is 60 kg/m and wind force is 200 Kg/m.?
a) 300 kg/m
b) 468 kg/m
c) 290 kg/m
d) 390 Kg/m
Answer: c
    Resultant stress = √[{(wc + wi )2 + ww2}]
            = √[{(150 + 60 )2 + 2002}]
            = 290 kg.
