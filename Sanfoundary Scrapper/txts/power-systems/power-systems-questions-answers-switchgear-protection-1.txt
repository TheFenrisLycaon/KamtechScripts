1. The factor which influences the acr de ionisation dominantly ________
a) line voltage
b) magnitude of transient fault current
c) speed of reclosure
d) all of the mentioned
a
2. A three phase transformer having a line voltage ratio of 400/33000 V is connected in the star-delta. The CTs on the 400V side have a CT ratio of 1000/5. What must be the ratio of CTs on the 33000 side?
a) 7/5
b) 5/7
c) 3/5
d) 5/2
a
√3*400*1000 = √3*33000*IL2
IL2= 400/33
Current through the secondary of CT on the primary side = 5A
Current through the pilot wire = 5√3  A
So CTs on the secondary side being star connected will have 5√3  A.
CT ratio on 33000V side  = 400/(33*5√3  ) = 7/5.
3. A three phase transformer having a line voltage ratio of 400/33000 V is connected in the star-delta. The CTs on the 400V side have a CT ratio of 1000/5. What will be the current through the pilot wire?
a) 5√3  A
b) 5/√3  A
c) 5 A
d) 1/5 A
a
√3*400*1000 = √3*33000*IL2
IL2= 400/33
Current through the secondary of CT on the primary side = 5A
Current through the pilot wire = 5√3  A. 
4. The neutral of the three phase 20 MVA, 11kV alternator is earthed through a resistance of 5 ohms, the relay is set to operate when there is an out of balance current of 1.5 A. The CTs  have a ratio of 100/5. What percentage of the winding is protected against L-G faults?
a) 76.4
b) 77.8
c) 73
d) None of the mentioned
d
5. The neutral of the three phase 20 MVA, 11kV alternator is earthed through a resistance of 5 ohms, the relay is set to operate when there is an out of balance current of 1.5 A. The CTs have a ratio of 100/5. What percentage of the winding is protected against earth faults?
a) 76.4
b) 77.8
c) 73
d) None of the mentioned
a
6. The neutral of the three phase 20 MVA, 11kV alternator is earthed through a resistance of 5 ohms, the relay is set to operate when there is an out of balance current of 1.5 A. The CTs have a ratio of 100/5. What percentage of the winding is protected against L-G faults?
a) 76.4
b) 23.6
c) 73
d) None of the mentioned
b
% winding unprotected = (Is*RV*100%)
                                          = (300*5√3)/11000*100
                                          = 23.6 %. 
7. The neutral of the three phase 20 MVA, 11kV alternator is earthed through a resistance of 5 ohms, the relay is set to operate when there is an out of balance current of 1.5 A. The CTs  have a ratio of 100/5. What should be the minimum value of the earthing resistance to protect 90% of winding?
a) 2.12 Ω
b) 1.12 Ω
c) 4.24 Ω
d) 3.24 Ω
a
        resistance required to protect 90% of the winding
       10  = Is*RV*100
       R = 2.12 Ω. 
8. While a transformer is energised, the differentially connected relay will
a) mal operate
b) not mal operate
c) mal operate for lagging loads
d) never mal operate
a
9. If a transformer is provided with differentially connected relay. To prevent the mal operation of the relay, the relay relay operating coil is biased with ______
a) 3rd harmonic
b) 2nd harmonic
c) 7th harmonic
d) 5th harmonic
d
10. If a transformer is provided with differentially connected relay. To prevent the mal operation of the relay, the relay restraining coil is biased with  ______________
