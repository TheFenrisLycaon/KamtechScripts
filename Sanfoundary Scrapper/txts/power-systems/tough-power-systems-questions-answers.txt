9. For a 100 MVA, 11 kV three phase Alternator observes a three phase fault at terminals of it. If the fault current is 2000 A, the pu value of positive sequence reactance ______
a) 2.62
b) 0.46
c) 1.31
d) 0.92
a
0.381 = 1/X
X= 1/0.381 =2.62 pu. 
10. A lossless TL having SIL of 3000 MW is provided with uniform distributed series capacitance compensation of 25% and shunt compensation of 30% then the SIL of compensated TL will be _______________
a) 3949.9
b) 3289
c) 2784.9
d) 2877.6
a
SIL α 1/Z
Zcomp = Zs√((1-kse)/((1+ksh)(1-Klsh)))
Kse = 0.25; Klsh = 0; Kcsh = 0.3,
Zcomp =0.7595
SILcomp = 0.7595*3000 = 3949.96 MVA.
