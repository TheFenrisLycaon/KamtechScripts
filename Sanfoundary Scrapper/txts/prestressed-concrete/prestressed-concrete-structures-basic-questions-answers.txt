c) Prestress in concrete
d) Modulus of elasticity of steel
a
2. The term Ec in losses developed by elastic deformation is expressed as ____________
a) Pe/A
b) Pc/Ea
c) P/AcEc
d) Ea/El
c
3. The term Es in losses developed by elastic deformation is defined as ____________
a) Shear in steel
b) Torsion in steel
c) Strain loss in steel
d) Loading in steel
c
Δfs = Loss of stress in steel, Es = strain loss in steel.
4. The loss of stress in steel due to elastic shortening or deformation is ____________
a) αefc
b) αcfc
c) αc/fc
d) αe/fc
a
αe = Es/Ec = modular ratio, fc = prestress in concrete at the level of steel, Es = modulus of elasticity of steel, Ec = modulus of elasticity of concrete.
5. A pretensioned concrete beam, 100mm wide and 300mm deep in prestressed by straight wires and modulus of elasticity of steel and concrete are 210 and 35n/mm2. Find modular ratio?
a) 14
b) 7
c) 6
d) 10
c
αe = Es/Ec = (210/35) = 6n/mm2.
6. A pretensioned concrete beam 200mm wide and 300mm deep, is prestressed by straight wires carrying an initial force of 150kn at eccentricity of  50mm, area of steel wires is 188mm2. Find initial stress in steel?
a) 1400
b) 800
c) 200
d) 100
b
Initial stress in steel = (150×103/188) = 800n/mm2.
7. A pre tensioned concrete beam 100mm wide and 300mm deep, initial force of 150kn at an eccentricity of 50mm, moment of inertia is 225×106mm4, initial stress in steel is 400n/mm2, modular ratio is 8. Estimate the percentage loss?
a) 10%
b) 5%
c) 14%
d) 20%
c
Loss of stress due to elastic deformation of concrete = αefc = (8×6.66) = 53n/mm2,
Percentage of loss of stress in steel = (53×100/400) = 13.25% = 14%.
8. A rectangular concrete beam 360mm deep and 200mm wide, is prestressed by means of fifteen 5mm diameter wires located 65mm from the bottom of the beam and three 5mm wires, located 275mm from top of the beam, initial tension stress is 840n/mm2. Calculate prestressing force?
a) 504×102kn
b) 500×102kn
c) 620×102kn
d) 400×102kn
a
9. A post tensioned concrete beam, 100mm wide and 400mm deep is prestressed by three cables, each with a cross sectional area of 50mm2, initial stress of 1200n/mm2. Calculate the stress in concrete at level of steel?
a) 2.4n/mm2
b) 2.0n/mm2
c) 2.7n/mm2

a) Initial stress
b) Average stress
c) Bondage stress
d) Anchorage stress
b
