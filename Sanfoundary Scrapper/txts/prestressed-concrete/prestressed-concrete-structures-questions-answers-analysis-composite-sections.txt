a
Pt > or less than (Ptw/ɳ + M/ɳZb + Ml/ɳZb‘)
Pb > or less than (Ptw – Mmin/Zt) where Pt = characteristic tensile strength of concrete (n/mm2), Pb = stress at bottom fiber (n/mm2).
12. The maximum eccentricity in the design of composite sections is given as ____________
a) e = ZtZb(Pt) / A(PbZt+PtZb)
b) e = ZtZb(Pt-Pb) / A(PbZt+PtZb)
