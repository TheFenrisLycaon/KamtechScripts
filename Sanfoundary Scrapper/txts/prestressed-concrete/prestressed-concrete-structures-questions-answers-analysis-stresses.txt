c) Colored concrete
d) Reinforced concrete
b
5. For computing the live load stresses, the effect of different moduli between the cast in situ and precast unit is considerable by ___________
a) Eccentricity
b) Modular ratio
c) Tensile stresses
d) Deflections
b
6. In modulus of elasticity of insitu concrete of grade M20 will be about ___________
a) 25kn/mm2
b) 30kn/mm2
c) 35kn/mm2
d) 40kn/mm2
a
7. The modular ratio of precast prestressed unit is ___________
a) 2.0 to 1.6
b) 1.1 to 1.5
c) 2.4 to 1.4
d) 2.2 to 1.7
b
8. A precast pretensioned beam of rectangular section has a breadth of 100mm and depth of 200mm and the beam with an effective span of 5mm is prestressed by tendon with their centroidal coinciding with the bottom kern and the initial force in the tendons is 150kn. Find prestressing force?
a) 20n/mm2
b) 34n/mm2
c) 15n/mm2
d) 12n/mm2
c
Stresses due to prestressing force = (2P/A) = (2x150x103/20000) = 15n/mm2.
9. Calculate stresses due to slab weight in precast sections given moment due to slab weight is 1200nm of section modulus 667×103?
a) 1.8n/mm2
b) 1.5n/mm2
c) 2.5n/mm2
d) 2.3n/mm2
a
Stresses due to slab weight in the precast sections = (1200000/667×103) = 1.8n/mm2.
10. Calculate the stress of pretensioned beams assuming as propped during the casting of the slab if Zt is 225×10, Zb is 128x104mm3 and moment due to self weight is 1200nmm?
a) 12.3 and 4.5
b) 0.53 and 0.94
c) 0.23 and 0.45
d) 1.23 and 0.67
b
Stresses due to this moment in the composite section:
At top = (1200000/225×104) = 0.53n/mm2 (compression), At bottom = (1200000/128×104) = 0.94n/mm2 (tension).
