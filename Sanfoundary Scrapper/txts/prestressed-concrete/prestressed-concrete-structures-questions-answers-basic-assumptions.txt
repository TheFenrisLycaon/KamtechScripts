a) 5
b) 4
c) 3
d) 2
c
2. The tensile stresses when do not exceed the limit of modulus then change in loading of member results in ___________
a) Change of bending moment
b) Change of stress
c) Change in shear
d) Change in rupture
b
3. Which conditions are negligible at the stage of visible cracking on concrete?
a) Bending conditions
b) Joint conditions
c) Zone conditions
d) Loading conditions
d
4. The stresses due to prestressing are referred as ___________
a) Combined stresses
b) Bending stresses
c) Anchoring stresses
d) Tensioning stresses
a
5. Which of the following notations are used for evaluating the relationship for combined stresses?
a) P, E, M, A, I
b) P, σ, M, g, I
c) P, W, M, π, L
d) P, θ, M, Z, L
a
P-Prestressing force, e-eccentricity of prestressing force, m – p × e – moment
A – Cross sectional area of the concrete member, I – second moment of area of section about its centroid.
6. The uniform prestress in a concrete member subjected to concentric prestressing is ___________
a) P/e
b) P/s
c) P/t
d) P/a
d
7. In case of eccentric prestressing force the support force Fsup is ___________
