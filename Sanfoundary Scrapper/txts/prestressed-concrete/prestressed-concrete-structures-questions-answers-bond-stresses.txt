c) Water and steel
d) Bricks and steel
a
2. The bond stress is zero at the distance equal to the ____________

b) Span length
c) Transmission length
d) Anchorage length
c
3. The relations proposed by Marshall for bond stress are given as ____________

b) (τ bp)x = (τ bp)maxe-4ψx
c) (τ bp)x = (τ bp)maxe-4ψ
d) (τ bp)x = (τ bp)maxe-4
a
4. According to Marshall the wires of 2 and 5mm diameter are stressed to ____________
a) 1500 and 1700n/mm2
b) 1575 and 1100n/mm2
c) 1400 and 1800n/mm2
d) 1250 and 1600n/mm2
b
5. The magnitude of the average bond stress compared to the maximum local bond stress is considerably ____________
a) Less
b) More
c) Zero
d) Constant
a
6. The stress in a steel wire gradually increases from zero to the ____________
a) Middle
b) Bottom
c) End
d) Top
c
7. The prestressing force of 90 to 95 percent is obtained at about ____________
a) Half of the transmission length
b) Three fourth of transmission length
c) Four third of transmission length
d) 1.5 of transmission length
b
8. A pre tensioned beam is prestressed with the cube strength of concrete at transfer is 30n/mm2 (β = 0.0235) calculate the transmission length?
a) 645mm
b) 1100mm
c) 485mm
d) 1600mm
c
Transmission length (Lt) = ((fcu)1/2 x 103/β)1/2
= ((30)1/2 x 103/0.0235) = 485mm.
9. A pretensioned beam is prestressed using 5mm diameter wires, τ bp = 7.42, ϕ = 0.00725, Lt = 485mm. Calculate the bond stress at l/4 and l/2 the transmission length from the end?
a) 3.7n/mm2 and 1.82n/mm2
b) 2.2n/mm2 and 5.8n/mm2
c) 4.8n/mm2 and 10.5n/mm2
d) 1.5n/mm2 and 7.4n/mm2
a
τ bp = 7.42e-0.0058X
Bond stress at L/4 is given by: τ bp = 7.42e-0.0058×121.25 = 8.7n/mm2, τ bp = 7.42e-0.0058×242.5 = 1.82n/mm2.
10. A pre tensioned beam is prestressed using 5mm diameter wires with an initial stress of 80 percent of the ultimate strength of steel fpu = 1600n/mm2. Calculate average bond stress?
a) 4.20n/mm2
b) 3.30n/mm2
c) 2.0n/mm2
d) 4.9n/mm2
b
Average bond stress = (τ bp)average 
= (19.6×0.8×1600/πx5x485) = 3.30n/mm2.
