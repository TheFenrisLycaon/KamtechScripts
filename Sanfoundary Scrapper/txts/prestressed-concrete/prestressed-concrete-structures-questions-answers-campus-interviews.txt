1. The computation of total ultimate moment required for the design of prestressed beams, knowledge of is necessary?
a) Spans
b) Self weights
c) Loads
d) Deflection
b
2. The estimation of self weight is expressed as ____________
a) wmin/wud = KDcgβ(L/h)L/fcu(d/h)2
b) wmin/wud = KDcgβ(L/h)L/fcu
c) wmin/wud = KDcgβ(L/h)
d) wmin/wud = KDcgβ
a
wmin/wud = KDcgβ(L/h)L/fcu(d/h)2
wmin = Self weight or minimum load, L = effective span, K = numerical constant, Dc = density of the concrete member, g = acceleration, β = moment coefficient, h = overall depth of girder,
wud = Ultimate design load.
