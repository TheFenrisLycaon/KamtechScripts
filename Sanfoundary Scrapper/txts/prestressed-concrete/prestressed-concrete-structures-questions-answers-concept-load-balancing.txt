5. A rectangular prestressed beam 150 mm wide and 300mm deep is used over a effective span of 10m and the cable with zero eccentricity at the supports, linearly varying to 50mm at the centre carries an effective prestressing force of 500kn(Z=225×104). Evaluate stress due to prestressing?
a) 22.2n/mm2
b) 42.2n/mm2
c) 32.2n/mm2
d) 52.2n/mm2
a
Self weight of beam g = (0.15×0.3×24)=1.08kn/m,
Moment due to self weight = (0.125×1.08×102=13.5knm,
 Stress due to self weight = (13.5×106/225×104) = 6n/mm2,
Stress due to prestressing = (P/A+Pe/A) = (500×103/45×103)+(500×103×50/225×104) = 22.22n/mm2.
6. A rectangular beam of 300mm wide and 800mm deep supports two concentrated loads of 20kn each at a span of 9m. Calculate the prestressing force and suggest a suitable cable profile if the eccentricity is 50mm?
a) 600kn
b) 500kn
c) 200kn
d) 800kn
a
Pe = QL/3 , P = (QL/3e) = (200×9000/3×100) = 600kn.
7. A beam of symmetrical I-section spanning 8m has a flange width of 250mm and flange thickness of 80mm, overall depth is 450mm, eccentricity of 150mm, g = 1.57kn/m, q = 2.50kn/m. Determine effective force?
a) 250
b) 217
c) 320
d) 200
b
Mq = (0.125×2.50×82)=20knm, Total moment M = (Mg+Mq)=32.5knm
P = (M/e) = (32.5×103/150) = 217kn.
