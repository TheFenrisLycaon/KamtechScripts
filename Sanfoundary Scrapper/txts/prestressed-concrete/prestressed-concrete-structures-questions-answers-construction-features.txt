b) Fabricating
c) Rubbing
d) Forrowing
b
2. The precast roof slabs are used for __________
a) Roof coverings
b) Slab coverings
c) Column coverings
d) Beam coverings
a
3. For spans in the range of 18-24m, the trusses are made in how many pieces?
a) 4 pieces
b) 2 pieces
c) 1 piece
d) 5 pieces
c
4. The polygonal trusses with inclined top chords are generally made of __________
a) 8m Blocks
b) 6m blocks
c) 12m block
d) 65m block
b
5. The polygonal trusses are less economical than?
a) Circular
b) Bow type
c) Curved
d) Oval
a
6. The steel bearing plates which are anchored serves as __________
a) Loading
b) Bearing
c) Stressing
d) Deforming
b
7. Calculate the area of concrete section such that loss ratio is 0.18 and compressive strength is 15n/mm2 (Nd = 377×103)?
a) 9.43n/mm2
b) 6.54n/mm2
c) 8.5n/mm2
d) 9.34n/mm2
a
Area of concrete section = (Nd/ɳfct) = (377×103)/0.8×15) = 3.316mm2.
8. Calculate the number of wires which are subjected to prestressing force of 471.5kn, the section adopted is 50000 using 7mm diameter high tensile wires initially stressed at 1100n/mm2?
a) 13.2
b) 11.13
c) 24.5
d) 34.2
b
N = (471.5×103/38.5×1100) = 11.13.
9. Calculate the cracking load such that section adopted is 50000, the loss ratio is 0.8, compressive strength of concrete is 9.43 and minimum reinforcement is 4.0mm2?
a) 455kn
b) 324kn
c) 577.2kn
d) 456.6kn
c
Section adapted = 50000, ɳ = 0.8, fct = 9.43, As = 4.0 (As is the minimum reinforcement of 0.8 percent in the section).
10. Which type of analysis should be done which will lead to an optimal design of planning a structure?
a) Comparative analysis
b) Strength analysis
c) Transferred analysis
d) Global analysis
