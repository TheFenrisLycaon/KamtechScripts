1. The width of cracks that developed in prestressed members is governed by how many factors?
a) 3
b) 4
c) 5
d) 7
b
2. The formula recommended by the British code BS: 8110 – 1985 for the estimation of surface crack width Wcr is?
a) Wcr = 3acrεm / 1+2(acr – Cmin/h-x)
b) Wcr = 3acrεm
c) Wcr = 3acrεm / 1+2(acr + Cmin/h-x)
d) Wcr = 5acrεm 
a
3. The reason for smaller crack widths in slabs under service loads is?
a) H – x is large
b) H + x is small
c) 0
d) Constant
b
4. The stabilized mean crack spacing acs can be expressed as ____________
a) C (A1/Ʃ0)
b) C (A1/Ʃ8)
c) C (A1/Ʃ5)
d) C (A1/Ʃ7)
a
At = effective concrete area in tension, Ʃ0 = sum of the circumferences of the reinforcing elements, C = empirical constant.
5. The width of cracks is influenced by?
a) Hollow stress
b) Linear stress
c) Net stress
d) Shear stress
c
Width of crack of Case 1: directly over a bar, the distance acr is equal to the concrete cover Cmin equation then reduces:  Wcr = 3acrεm and Case 2: when distance acr is large: Wcr = 1.5(h-x) εmin.
6. The British and Indian standard codes on prestressed concrete maximum limiting crack for members exposed to aggressive environment is?
a) 0.1mm
b) 0.3mm
c) 0.6mm
d) 0.4mm
a
7. A nano polymer range which meets wider expectations as aesthetics is known as ____________
a) Refit
b) Break
c) Struck
d) Collapse
a
8. The construction joints should be located at points of ____________
a) Maximum shear
b) Minimum shear
c) Total shear
d) Average shear
b
9. When the work has resumed the surfaces of the concrete previously placed should be cleaned of ____________
a) Ash
b) Mud
c) Dirt
d) Soil
c
10. In roadway slabs, construction joints should be formed?
a) Vertical
b) Horizontal
c) Aligned
d) Loaded
a
