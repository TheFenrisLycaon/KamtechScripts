1. The soffit of the beam after the transfer of prestress to concrete will be under ____________
a) Tension
b) Compression
c) Breakage
d) Bondage
b
2. The compressive and tensile stresses developed in cracking moments are due to ____________
a) Bending loads
b) Transverse loads
c) Tensile loads
d) Compressive loads
b
3. The micro cracks develop as soon as the tensile strain in concrete exceeds about ____________
a) 80-100×10-6 units
b) 100-150×10-6 units
c) 150-300×10-6 units
d) 300-500×10-6 units
a
4. When the loads in a concrete member are further increased than permitted, the crack widths are of an order of limit?
a) 0.01-0.02mm5
b) 0.05-0.10mm5
c) 0.03-0.05mm5
d) 0.07-0.08mm5
a
5. A rectangular concrete beam of cross section 120mm wide and 300mm deep is prestressed by a straight cable, effective force of 180kn at an eccentricity 50, area of 36×103mm2(z=18×105mm3). Find the total stress due to prestress?
a) 10
b) 25
c) 35
d) 45
a
Stresses due to prestress = (p/a) = (180×103/36×103) = 5n/mm2, (pe/z) = (180×103×50/18×105) = 5n/mm2
Total stress = ((p/a)+(pe/z))=(5+5) = 10n/mm2.
6. A rectangular concrete beam of cross section 100mm wide and 400mm deep is prestressed by a straight cable of span 6m, imposed load is 3.14kn/m, area is 36×103mm2(Z=18×105mm3). Calculate working moment assuming the self weight of concrete as 24kn/m3?
a) 10.25
b) 2.25
c) 3.25
d) 4.25
a
 Total load W = (g+q) = (0.96+3.14) = 4.1kn/m, Maximum working moment = (0.125×4×62) = 18.45knm
(M/Z) = (18.45×106/18×105) = 10.25n/mm2.
7. When the tensile stresses are developed in the cracks, they are visible at ____________
a) Hoop stress of beams
b) Soffit of beams
c) Sagging of beams
d) Hogging of beams
b
8. The cracks appear when the tensile stresses at the soffit are equal to ____________
a) Modulus of elasticity
b) Modulus of rupture
c) Tension modulus
d) Reinforcement modulus
b
9. The widths of the cracks are influenced by ____________
a) Degree of bond
b) Stress
c) Strain
d) Tension
a
10. The formulae for load factor against cracking is ____________
a) Cracking moment/Working moment
b) Cracking moment/Bending moment
c) Cracking moment/Tensile moment
d) Cracking moment/Aerial moment
