1. The ultimate shear resistance for any given section, vc should be least of values __________
a) vcw and vcf
b) vew and vef
c) vrw and vrf
d) vdw and vdf
a
2. What should be provided if the shear force due to ultimate load is less than the shear force of the concrete?
a) Tensile reinforcement
b) Shear reinforcement
c) Principle reinforcement
d) Compressive reinforcement
b
3. The spacing provided for shear reinforcement is given as __________
a) Sv = (Asv0.87fy/0.4b)
b) (Asv0.91fy/0.4b)
c) (Asv0.12fy/0.4b)
d) (Asv0.23fy/0.4b)
a
4. When the shear force due to ultimate loads is less than 0.5 times shear force of concrete then shear reinforcement is?
a) Provided
b) Not provided
c) Made equal
d) Made zero
b
Then no shear reinforcement is provided in the members of low importance.
5. When v > vc condition exits, then the shear reinforcement provided includes which extra terms than actual spacing equation?
a) fy, dt, v, vc
b) ft, dt, v, vc
c) dt, v, vc
d) fe, dt, v, vc
a
The extra terms used are fy , dt, v, vc these are included in the spacing equation Sv
 Sv = (Asv0.87fydt / V-Vc).
