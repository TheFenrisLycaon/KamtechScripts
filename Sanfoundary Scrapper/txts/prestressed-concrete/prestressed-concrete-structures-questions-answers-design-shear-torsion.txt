1. Which type of cables are advantages in reducing the effective shear?
a) Straight
b) Curved
c) Trapezoidal
d) Longitudinal
b
2. The various codes recommend empirical relations to estimate ____________
a) Ultimate shear resistance
b) Ultimate torsional resistance
c) Ultimate bending resistance
d) Ultimate load
a
3. Which type of shear reinforcement should be provided for members with thin webs?
a) Maximum shear reinforcement
b) Minimum shear reinforcement
c) Nominal shear reinforcement
d) Tensile reinforcement
c
4. The pre and post tensioned members with bonded tendons bond stress between ____________
a) Steel and concrete
b) Steel and water
c) Steel and aggregates
d) Steel and plastic
a
5. In case of pre tensioned member, the computations of transmission length are influenced by?
a) Bond
b) Flexure
c) Torsion
d) Tension
a
6. When prestress is transferred to concrete by means of external anchorages which pressure is developed?
a) Bearing
b) Twisting
c) Torsion
d) Bent
a
7. The bearing pressure on the concrete is given as ____________
a) 0.4fci
b) 0.8fci
c) 0.12fci
d) 0.2fci
b
8. The effective punching area Apun is generally the contact area of ____________
a) Tendon device
b) Anchorage device
c) Stress device
d) Strain device
b
9. The end block of a beam has a rectangular section 100mm wide by 200mm deep, the force of cable is 200kn. Find the actual bearing pressure?
a) 30n/mm2
b) 40n/mm2
c) 20n/mm2
d) 10n/mm2
c
Bearing area Abr = (100×100) = 10000mm2,
Actual bearing pressure = (200×103) / 10000 = 20n/mm2.
10. The end block of a prestressed concrete beam has a rectangular section; a cable carrying a force of 200kn is to be anchored against the end block at the centre if the cube strength of concrete at transfer is 30n/mm2. Design the maximum permissible bearing pressure?(Abr = 10000mm2)
a) 24n/mm2
b) 48n/mm2
c) 54n/mm2
d) 12n/mm22
