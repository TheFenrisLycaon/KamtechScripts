1. Which of failure is considered in the design of prestressed concrete members for the limit states of collapse?
a) Total failure
b) Shear failure
c) Ultimate failure
d) Collapse failure
c
2. The maximum design value of the moment of resistance of rectangular flanged section varies from ____________
a) 0.08fckbd2 to 0.2fckbd2
b) 0.11fcckd2 to 0.5fckbd2
c) 0.15fcckd2 to 0.8fckbd2
d) 0.21fcckd2 to 0.9fckbd2
a
3. It is often preferable to use a larger section, because it means a saving on ____________
a) Deflection
b) Cost
c) Stress
d) Strain
a
 Mud = 0.21fckbd2, the dimension based on this expression are the minimum values and it often preferable to use a larger section because it means a saving on the costly prestressing tendons.
4. The area of high tensile and un tensioned reinforcement required to mobilize the desired flexural strength is computed using?
a) Tension equilibrium
b) Force equilibrium
c) Transverse equilibrium
d) Rotational equilibrium
b
5. A pretensioned prestressed concrete beam of rectangular section is required to support a design ultimate moment of 100knm. Design the section if fck is 50n/mm2 and fp 1600n/mm2, xu/d is 0.5?
a) 300
b) 500
c) 600
d) 200
a

6. A post tensioned beam of unsymmetrical I section is required to support a design ultimate moment of 1200 knm and determine the overall depth and thickness of the compression flange required if fck is 35n/mm2 and fp is 1500n/mm2?
a) 1000mm2
b) 1015mm2
c) 1030mm2
d) 1003mm2
d
Assuming the neutral axis depth, xu = hf = 200mm, mu = 0.87fpAp (d-0.42xu), Ap = (mu/0.87fp (d-0.42xu)) = (1200×106/0.87×1500(1000-0.42×200)) = 1003mm2.
7. Due to presence of precompression, prestressed concrete is ideally suited for the design of members subjected to ____________
a) Axial tension
b) Prestressed tension
c) Principle stress
d) Bonded stress
a
8. The design essentially considered for axial tension is to determine the ____________
a) Deflection
b) Eccentricity
c) Cross section
d) Loads
c
9. According to Indian standard code IS: 3370 the load factors against cracking and collapse should not be less than?
a) 15
b) 1.5
c) 3
d) 0.3
b
10. Design a suitable section for the tie member of a truss to support a maximum design tensile force of 500kn. The permissible compressive stress in concrete at transfer is 15n/mm2.
a) 41500
b) 4000
c) 22000
d) 1500
a
Area of concrete section = (Nd/ ɳ fct) = (500×103/0.8×15) = 41500mm2.
