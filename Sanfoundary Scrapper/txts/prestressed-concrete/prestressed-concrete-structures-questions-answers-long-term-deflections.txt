1. The deformation of prestressed members change with time as a result of __________
a) Creep and shrinkage
b) Friction and torsion
c) Deformation and flexibility
d) Cracking moment
a
2. The deflection of prestressed members can be computed relative to given __________
a) Bending moment
b) Strain diagram
c) Curvature
d) Datum
d
3. The prestressed concrete member develops deformation under the influence of __________
a) Flexural moments
b) Stress strain diagram
c) Prestress and transverse loads
d) Self weight
c
4. The net curvature ϕtat a section at any given stage is given as __________
a) ϕt = ϕw + ϕe
b) ϕt = ϕm + ϕn
c) ϕt = ϕp + ϕs
d) ϕt = ϕmt + ϕpt
d
ϕt = ϕmt + ϕpt, ϕmt = change of curvature caused by transverse loads,
ϕpt = change of curvature caused by prestress, as the time changes the compressive stress distribution in the concrete also changes under sustained transverse loads.
5. The section of sustained transverse loads under compressive stress distribution in the concrete changes with __________

b) Intensity
c) Bending moment
d) Curing
a
6. The creep strain due to the transverse loads is directly computed as a function of __________
a) Strain coefficient
b) Creep coefficient
c) Stress coefficient
d) Bending
c
Φmt = (1+ϕ)ϕi,
 ϕ = creep coefficient, ϕi = initial curvature immediately after the application of transverse loads.	
7. Which of the following person made attributions to evaluate the curvature under simplified assumptions?
a) Mchenry
b) Rose
c) Daglon
d) Carnwallis
a
8. The creep curvature due to prestress is obtained on the simplified assumption that creep is induced by the average prestress acting over the given time is according to __________
a) Busemann
b) Douglas
c) Lorley
d) Neville
d
9. A simplified but an approximate procedure for computing long time deflections is given by __________
a) Siess
b) Corley
