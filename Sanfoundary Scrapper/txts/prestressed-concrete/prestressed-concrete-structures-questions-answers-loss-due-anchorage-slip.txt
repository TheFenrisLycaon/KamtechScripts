6. Which of the following system is similar to loss due to anchorage slip?
a) Freyssinet system
b) Magnel Balton system
c) Leonhardt-Baur system
d) Gifford Udall system
c
7. The loss of stress due to anchorage slip of anchorages is given as __________
a) EsA/L
b) EaA/L
c) EcA/L
d) EwA/L
a
Anchorage slip Δ = PL/AEs, But moment Loss of stress, (Δf)a = P/A,
By considering both equations (Δf)a = EsΔ/l.
8. A concrete beam is post tensioned by a cable carrying an initial stress of 1000n/mm2, the slip at the jacking end was end was observed to be 5mm; modulus of elasticity of steel is 210kn/mm2. Estimate the percentage loss of stress due to anchorage if length of beam is 30m?
a) 3.5%
b) 4.5%
c) 5.5%
d) 8.7%
a
For a 30m long beam, loss of stress = (210×103×5)/(30×1000) = 35n/mm2,
Loss of stress = 35/1000×100 = 3.5%.
9. A post tensioned cable of beam 10m long is initially tensioned to a stress of 1000n/mm2 at one end, slope is 1 in 24 tendons curved at each end , area is 600mm2, Es is 210kn/mm2, coefficient of friction between duct and cable is 0.55, friction coefficient for wave effect is 0.0015perm. During anchorage, if there is a slip 3mm at the jacking end, calculate final force?
a) 39.8kn
b) 40.2kn
c) 37.8kn
d) 48.8kn
c
μα = (0.55×1/12) = 0.046, kx = (0.0015×10) = 0.015,
P˳(μα+kx) = 1000(0.046+0.015) = 61n/mm2, Slip at the jacking end = 3 = (PL/AE)
P = (3×210×103×600/10×1000) = 37800kn = 37.8kn.
10. The total losses of stress that could be encountered under normal conditions of work were recommended by __________
a) Lin
b) Marks
c) Keifer
d) Neville
a
11. A prestressed concrete beam, 200mm wide and 300mm deep is prestressed with wires (area is 320mm2) located at a constant eccentricity of 50mm, initial stress of 1000n/mm2, span is 10m. Calculate loss of stress due to friction and slip anchorage of post tensioned beam?(Es = 210kn/mm2, Ec = 35kn/mm2).
a) 21 and 15
b) 35 and 25
c) 15 and 20
d) 5 and 10
