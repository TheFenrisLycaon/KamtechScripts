1. Which of the following results in the reduction of stress in steel used for prestress?
a) Shrinkage
b) Friction
c) Creep
d) Anchorage slip
c
2. The loss of stress due to creep of concrete can be estimated by ___________
a) Ultimate creep strain
b) Ultimate load
c) Ultimate creep stress
d) Ultimate creep tension
a
3. The value of creep coefficient ‘f’ depends upon ___________
a) Humidity
b) Frost
c) Uv rays
d) Ice
a
4. The creep coefficient varies from a minimum value of ___________
a) 2.0
b) 1.5
c) 2.5
d) 1.0
b
5. The creep coefficient is high for ___________
a) Pretensioned
b) Post tensioned
c) Chemical tensioned
d) Electrical tensioned
a
6. The creep coefficient equation is given as ___________
a) Creep strain/elastic strain
b) Creep stress/elastic stress
c) Elastic strain/creep strain
d) Elastic stress/creep stress
a
Creep coefficient = (creep strain / elastic strain), ϕ = ℇc/ℇe, ℇc = ϕ ℇe = ϕ(fs/Ec),
 Loss of stress in steel = ℇcEcϕEs = ϕ(fs/Ec)Es = ϕfcαe.
7. The loss of stress in steel due to creep of concrete is ___________
a) ℇcc fc Es
b) ℇc fc Ec
c) ℇc fe αe
d) ℇcc fc ϕ
a
ℇcc = ultimate creep strain for a sustained unit stress, fc = compressive stress in concrete at the level of steel, Es = modulus of elasticity of steel.
8. A concrete beam of rectangular section 100mm wide, area is 3×104, initial stress is 1200n/mm2 of 7mm diameter located at an eccentricity 50mm. Estimate the loss of stress due to creep of concrete using the ultimate creep strain method?
a) 88
b) 40
c) 50
d) 120
a
9. A post tensioned concrete beam of rectangular section 200mm wide and 300mm deep is stressed by a parabolic cable with eccentricity 50mm at centre of span, area is 3×104mm2, initial stress is 1200n/mm2 Find the stress in concrete at the level of steel?
a) 10n/mm2
b) 15n/mm2
c) 6n/mm2
d) 8n/mm2
d
Stress in concrete at the level of steel: (240000/30000) = 8n/mm2.
10. The British code for structural concrete recommends design values of ultimate creep strain of pretensioning is ___________
a) 48×10-6
b) 53×10-6
c) 40×10-6
d) 38×10-6
a
