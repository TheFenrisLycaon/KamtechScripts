1. The loss of prestress due to friction generally occurs in case of ____________
a) Post tensioned members
b) Pre tensioned members
c) Chemical members
d) Electrical members
a
2. The total loss of prestress due to friction is of ____________
a) 4 types
b) 2 types
c) 8 types
d) 3 types
b
Loss of prestress due to effect of curvature, Loss of prestress due to wobble effect and frictional losses can be reduced by over tensioning the tendons by an amount equal to the maximum frictional loss and jacking the tendons from both ends of the beam adopted generally, when the tendons are long or when the angles of bearing are large.
3. The loss of stress due to curvature effect depends upon ____________
a) Alignment
b) Midpoint
c) Centerline
d) Exterior point
a
4. The wobble effect due to loss of stress is also known as ____________
a) Wave effect
b) Ray effect
c) Bubble effect
d) Bulb effect
a
5. The wobble effect is the result of ____________
a) Misalignment
b) Extreme alignment
c) Tensile alignment
d) Anchorage alignment
a
6. The loss of stress due to friction is given as ____________
a) 1-(μα+Kx)
b) 1-(μα+Kx)
c) 1-(μα+Kx)
d) 1-(μα+Kx)
a
Px = p˳e-(μα+kx), Loss of stress (Δf)f = 1-(μα+Kx),
Px = Prestressing force at section x, P˳ = initial prestressing force, μ = coefficient of friction between the cable and concrete, k = wobble effect, d = cumulative angle.
7. The value of ‘μ’ in loss of stress equation depends upon ____________
a) Type of curing
b) Type of concrete
c) Type of steel
d) Type of aggregates
c
8. A post tensioned concrete beam 200mm wide and 450mm deep, of span 10m, initial stress of 840n/mm2 is available in the un jacked end immediately after the anchoring. Find the angle between tangents to the cable at supports?
a) 0.13
b) 0.12
c) 0.10
d) 0.23
b
Angle between the horizontal tangent drawn to the cable at support sinα = (5/84) = 0.06radians,
Cumulative angle between tangents to the cable at supports = (2×0.06) = 0.12radians.
9. A concrete tank if has a minimum stress in wires 600n/mm2 immediately after tensioning and the coefficient of friction is 0.5. Calculate the maximum stress to be applied to the wires at the jack?
a) 900n/mm2
b) 960n/mm2
c) 850n/mm2
d) 800n/mm2
b
Px = P˳e-μα,
600 = P˳e-(0.5×π/2),
P˳ = (600) × (2.71830.79) = 1320n/mm2, Average stress in wires = (1320+600/2) = 960n/mm2.
10. A cylindrical concrete tank, 40m external diameter is to be prestressed circumferentially by means of a high strength steel wire (Es = 210kn/mm2) jacked at 4 points and 90 degrees apart. Find the expected extension at the jack?
a) 150mm
b) 130mm
c) 144mm
d) 133mm
c
Length of wires = (π×40×1000/4) = 104πmm,
Extension at the jack = (960/210×103×104π) = 144mm.
