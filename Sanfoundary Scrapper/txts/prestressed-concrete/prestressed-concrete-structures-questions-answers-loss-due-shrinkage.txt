b) Elongation
c) Bulking
d) Stressing
a
2. The shrinkage of concrete is influenced by ___________
a) Type of cement
b) Type of chemical
c) Type of admixtures
d) Type of retarders
a
3. Which of the following is used to reduce shrinkage of concrete?
a) High strength concrete
b) Admixtures
c) Boulders
d) Low water cement ratio
a
4. The rate of shrinkage is higher at ___________
a) End
b) Surface
c) Middle
d) Edges
b
5. The differential shrinkage between the interior and surface of large members result in ___________
a) Surface gradient
b) Strain gradient
c) Compatibility gradient
d) Stress gradient
b
6. Which curing is adopted in case of pretensioned members to prevent shrinkage?
a) Surface curing
b) Edge curing
c) Moist curing
d) Total curing
c
7. After the transfer of prestress, the total residual shrinkage will be larger in case of ___________
a) Pretensioned members
b) Post tensioned members
c) Chemical tensioned members
d) Biological tensioned members
a
8. Which of the following Indian standard code is recommended for the loss of prestress due to shrinkage?
a) IS: 1445
b) IS: 1343
c) IS: 1210
d) IS: 1550
b
9. The loss of prestress due to shrinkage is obtained by multiplying ___________
a) Shrinkage strain and modulus of elasticity
b) Principal stress and durability of concrete
c) Curing and grade of concrete
d) Compression and tension
a
10. The post tensioned members in dry atmospheric conditions, the shrinkage may be increased by ___________
a) 50%
b) 70%
c) 30%
d) 100%
a
11. A concrete beam is prestressed by a cable carrying an initial prestressing force of 300kn, area is 300mm2. Calculate the percentage of loss of stress due to shrinkage in pretensioned members?
a) 6.3%
b) 5.3%
c) 4%
d) 2.3%
a
If the beam is pretensioned the total residual shrinkage strain = 300×10-6,
Loss of stress = (300×10-6)(210×103) = 63n/mm2, % loss 0f stress = (63×1000/100) = 6.3%.
