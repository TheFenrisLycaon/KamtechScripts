b) HYSD bars
c) Torsion bars
d) Wooden bars
b
3. The trusses spacing for 6m prestressed bow string truss with cable reinforcement span for 18m material requirement per truss?
a) 338-433
b) 311-234
c) 829-456
d) 675-919
a
4. The polygonal built up from blocks with prestressed bottom chord having wire cable for 18m – concrete requirement per truss (m3) is?
a) 2.50
b) 2.63
c) 2.78
d) 2.00
b
5. The truss spacing 12m prestressed bow string of linear element with wire reinforcement (18m) grade of concrete (n/mm2).
a) 30- 40n/mm2
b) 10- 50n/mm2
c) 20- 70n/mm2
d) 40- 90n/mm2
a
6. Calculate effective length of warehouse shed such that length is given as 2.11m and area is given as 650mm2?
a) 3.28m
b) 4.28m
c) 6.25m
d) 1.37m
d
Effective length = Lc = (0.65×2.11) = 1.37m.
7. Calculate total diameter ratio (d’/D) of reinforced concrete truss member such that the internal diameter is 40mm and external diameter is given as 200mm?
a) 0.6
b) 0.8
c) 0.2
d) 9.6
c
d’/D ratio  = (40/200) = 0.2mm.
8. Calculate moment of reinforced concrete truss such that bending moment is given as 4.3 and breadth is given as 250mm and depth is 200mm, characteristic strength of concrete is 35n/mm2?
a) 0.48
b) 0.56
c) 0.34
d) 0.23
a
M = Mu /fck b D   = (6.45×106/35x250x2002) = 0.48.
9. Calculate the compression moments of reinforced concrete trusses such that compression in the member is 395, characteristic strength is 35n/mm2, breadth is 250mm and depth is given as 200?
a) 0.443
b) 0.338
c) 0.654
d) 0.234
b
Pu/fckbD = (592.5×103/35x200x200) = 0.338.
10. Calculate minimum reinforcement of 0.8% in the section such that given breadth is 250mm, Diameter is 200m?
a) 400
b) 600
c) 500
d) 800
a
Minimum reinforcement of 0.8% in the section As = (0.8x200x250/100) = 400mm2.
