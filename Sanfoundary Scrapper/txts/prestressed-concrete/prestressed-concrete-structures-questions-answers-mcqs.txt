1. In the case of large floor and roof coverings using prestressed concrete as material, one of the structural forms for adoption is?
a) Concrete panels
b) Reinforced disc
c) Spherical domes
d) Trapezoidal domes
c
2. If cement, fine aggregate and coarse aggregate are simultaneously charged then it improves ____________
a) Tension in concrete
b) Uniformity in concrete
c) Compression in concrete
d) Strain in concrete
b
3. Under usual conditions up to which percentage the water should be placed in the mixer drums.
a) 15%
b) 20%
c) 10%
d) 12%
c
4. When the mixture is mixed in the plant the time should not be less than?
a) 50s
b) 100s
c) 20s
d) 10s
a
5. For heavily reinforced concrete members the nominal maximum size of aggregates shall be ____________
a) 10mm
b) 1mm
c) 2mm
d) 5mm
d
6. The strength of concrete primarily depends upon the ____________
a) Workability
b) w/c ratio
c) Aggregates ratio
d) Cement content
b
7. What are the advantages of reducing the w/c ratio?
a) Superior dimensional stability
b) Cost
c) Area
d) Workability
a
Increased compressive, flexural and tensile strength, increased density of concrete with lesser voids, increased water tightness, lower absorption of moisture due to less porosity, increased resistance to weathering, better bond between concrete and reinforcement, superior dimensional stability, lesser shrinkage cracks.
8. In massive structures, concrete should be placed in ____________
a) Trapezoidal layers
b) Horizontal layers
c) Longitudinal layers
d) Edge layers
b
9. Each layer should be placed before the preceding batch undergoes the initial set of ____________
a) Torsion
b) Tension
c) Consolidation
d) Strain
c
10. In the case of horizontal shallow beams, concrete should preferably deposited starting from ____________
a) Centre of span
b) Edge of span
c) Outer portion of span
d) Inner portion of span
a
