1. What is the first approach in optimization methods?
a) Theory of bending
b) Theory of layout
c) Theory of elongation
d) Theory of stress
b
2. During which period the simultaneous mode of failure approach was persued?
a) 1940 to 1950
b) 1930 to 1940
c) 1920 to 1930
d) 1910 to 1920
a
3. The third major approach of structural optimization is based on the concept?
a) Criterion of design
b) Criterion of optimality
c) Criterion of texture
d) Criterion of span
b
4. The structural optimization problem is generally expressed as __________
a) Maximize Z = F(x)
b) Minimize Z = F(x)
c) Z = F(x)
d) Z = F(t)
b
Minimize Z = F(x), subject to Gj(x) < 0, j = 1,2….m
Where x is the design variable, represented by the column vector of dimensions n and each design represented by x is a point in hyper-space defined by the design variables, F(x) = the objective or merit function, Gj(x) = constraints, m = number of constraints.
5. What is the fourth major area of development?

b) Computer
c) Planning
d) Machine design
a
6. What is a constraint?
a) Response
b) Parameter
c) Limitation
d) Principle
c
7. The behavior constraints are those imposed on the __________

d) Durability response
b
8. In structural designs, behavior constraints are imposed on __________
a) Stresses
b) Strain
c) Reactions
d) Bending
a
9. What is the objective function of a structural design problem?
