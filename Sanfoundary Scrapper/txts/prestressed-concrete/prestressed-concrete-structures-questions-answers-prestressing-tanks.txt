b) 5.6n/mm2
c) 11.2n/mm2
d) 15.2n/mm2
a
Fc = Nd/ ɳt+ fmin.w/ ɳ = 720/0.75 x 120+1/0.75 = 9.4n/mm2.
11. Calculate vertical prestressing force if wires of 5mm diameter with an initial stress of 1000n/mm2 are available for circumferential winding and Freyssinet cables made up of 12 wires of 8mm diameter stressed to 1200n/mm2 are to be used for vertical prestressing?

a) 10.75n/mm2
b) 14.8n/mm2
c) 12.6n/mm2
d) 10.65n/mm2
a
Fc = Nd/ ɳt+ fmin.w/ ɳ = 840/0.75×120+ 1/0.75 = 10.75n/mm2.

c) 12.4mm
d) 18.5mm
b
S = 2×840/0.075x1000x20/10.75x30x103x120 = 11.6mm.

a) 15.4
b) 21.5
c) 25.4
d) 2.6
c
Mt = Mw x Wt / ɳ     16500(0.11/0.075) = 25.4×106nmm/m.
