b) Fsup = (p/a-pe/zt)+(mg/zt)+(mq/zt)
c) Fsup = (p/a-pe/zt)+(mg/zt)+(mq/zt)

Mq=ql2/8
Mg=gl2/8
3. A concrete beam of rectangular section, 250mm wide and 600mm deep. Calculate the bending moment that can be applied without applying tension at the soffit of the beam with given m/z value as 5.74?
a) 26.4
b) 54.8
c) 34.5
d) 86.1
d
Z = (250×6002/6) = 15×106mm3,
M = (5.74×15×106) = 86.1×106nmm = 86.1knm.
4. A prestressed concrete beam of section 200mm wide by 300mm deep of imposed load 4kn/m at a span of 6m, density of concrete is 24kn/m3. Find the concentric prestressing force necessary for zero fiber stress at the soffit?
a) 490
b) 560
c) 230
d) 310
a
Mg = (0.125×1.44×62) = 6.48knm, Mq = (0.125×4×62) = 18knm, Zb=Zt = (200×3002/6) = 3×106mm3
P/A = 8.16, P = (8.16×6×104) = 489.6kn.
5. The locus of the points of application of resultant force in any structure is termed as ___________
a) Pressure line
b) Hollow line
c) Beam line
d) Tendon line
a
6. The concept of pressure line is very useful in understanding the concept of ___________
a) Load carrying mechanism
b) Bending mechanism
c) Shear mechanism
d) Torsion mechanism
a
7. The location of the pressure line depends upon ___________
a) Breakage and Bondage
b) Magnitude and direction
c) Shear and Torsion
d) Pressure and equilibrium
b
8. The eccentricity e in the pressure line diagram is?
a) h/16
b) h/12
c) h/15
d) h/8
a
9. The change in the external moments in the elastic range of prestressed concrete beam results in ___________
a) Bending moment in pressure line
b) Torsion in pressure line
c) Flexure in pressure line
d) Shift of the pressure line
d
10. The shift of pressure line measured from centroidal axis is obtained as ___________
a) (m/p)-e
b) (m/q)-e
c) (m/r)-e
d) (m/i)-e
a
E’= (a-e) = (m/p)-e, basically the load carrying mechanism is comprised of a constant force with a changing lever arm as in the case of prestressed concrete sections, and a changing force with a constant lever arm prevailing in reinforced concrete sections.
