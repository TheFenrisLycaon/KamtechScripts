c) Bond
d) Anchorage
b
3. The effect of maximum shear stress (τ v) produces __________
a) Principal tensile stresses
b) Principal compression stresses
c) Principal strain stresses
d) Principal span stresses
a
4. In a prestressed concrete member, the shear stress is generally accompanied by __________
a) Zone stresses
b) Anchorage stresses
c) Direct stresses
d) Bondage stresses
c
5. The major principal stresses produced on diagonal plane is expressed as __________
a) fx + fy/2
b) fx + fy/2 – 1/2 ((fx – fy)2 + 4τ v2)1/2
c) fx + fy/2 + 1/2 ((fx – fy)2 + 4τ v2)1/2
d) fx – fy/2
b
Minor principal stress Fmin = fx + fy/2 + 1/2 ((fx – fy)2 + 4τ v2)1/2
Fx, Fy  are the direct stresses in horizontal & vertical directions respectively.
6. If the direct stresses are compressive, then the magnitude of principal stresses in prestressed concrete member gets __________
a) Increased
b) Decreased
c) Constant
d) Zero
a
7. How many ways are there for improving the shear resistance of structural concrete members by prestressing techniques?
a) 4
b) 6
c) 3
d) 2
c
Horizontal or axial prestressing by inclined or sloping cables and vertical or transverse prestressing.
8. A prestressed concrete beam span 10mm of rectangular section, 120mm wide & 300mm deep is axially prestressed on effective force of 180kn, uniformly distributed load of 5kn/m include the self weight of member. Find maximum shear stress at support?
a) 20.5n/mm2
b) 1.05n/mm2
c) 15.08n/mm2
d) 4.05n/mm2
b
Shear force at support V = (5×10/2) = 25kn
Maximum shear stress at support, τv = (3v/2bh) = (3/2)x(25×103 /120×300) = 1.05n/mm2.
9. A prestressed concrete beam of span 10m of rectangular section, 120mm wide & 300mm deep a curved cable having an eccentricity of 100mm at the centre of span. Find the slope of cable of support?
a) 0.08 radians
b) 0.01 radians
c) 0.04 radians
d) 0.12 radians
c
Slope of cable at support = (4e/l) = (4×100/10×100) = 0.04 radians.
10. Which type of tensioning is generally uneconomical for vertical prestressing?
a) Post tensioning
b) Pre tensioning
c) Chemical tension
d) Thermal tension
