b) Un cracked
c) Instantaneous
d) Non instantaneous
c
2. Which of the following is the equation given Mohr’s first theorem?
a) Area of bending moment deflection/flexural rigidity
b) Moment/flexural rigidity
c) Deflection/flexural rigidity
d) Loads/flexural rigidity
a
Slope = area of bending moment deflection/flexural rigidity, θ = A/EI.
3. Which of the following is the equation given by Mohr’s second theorem?
a) Mid span/flexural rigidity
b) Moment of area of bending moment diagram/flexural rigidity
c) End span/flexural rigidity
d) Thickness/flexural rigidity
b
Intercept, a = (moment of the area of bending moment deflections/flexural rigidity), a = AX/EI,
a = deflection at the centre for symmetrically loaded, simply supported beam (since the tangent is horizontal for such cases), A = area of bending moment deflection between A and C, x = distance of the centroid of the bending moment deflection between A and C from the left support, EI = flexural rigidity of beam.
4. Which of the following deflections are directly obtained by Mohr’s second area theorem?
a) Simply supported beam
b) Uniformly distributed load
c) Point beams
d) Fixed beams
a

6. A straight tendon at a uniform eccentricity below the centroidal axis is given as __________
a) –PeL2/4EI
b) –PeL2/8EI
c) –PeL2/14EI
d) –PeL2/16EI
b
If the camber of beam with straight tendons upward deflections are considered as negative and
a = -(PeL) (L/4)/EI = -PeL2/8EI, P = effective prestressing force, e = eccentricity, L = length of beam.
7. A tendon with a trapezoidal profile considering the bending moment and deflection at the centre of the beam is obtained by __________
a) –Pe/6EI(2l12+6l1l2+3l22)
b) –Pe/6EI(2l12+6l1l2+3l22)
c) –Pe/6EI(2l12+6l1l2+3l22)
d) –Pe/6EI(2l12+6l1l2+3l22)
b
8. The deflection of a beam with parabolic tendon is given as __________
a) –5PeL2/48EI

a
9. The deflection is computed in a way similar to sloping tendon is given as __________
a) 2PL2/24EI
b) 4PL2/24EI
c) PL3/24EI (-2e1+e2)
d) PL2/24EI (e1+e2)
c
A   =   (-PL2/12EI (e1+e2)) + (Pe2L2/8EI)
A   = (PL3/24EI (-2e1+e2)).
