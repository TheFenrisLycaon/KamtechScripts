1. During stress distribution in end blocks the prestressing force is applied as ______________
a) Concentrated force
b) Deviated force
c) Tension force
d) Torsion force
a
2. The stress distribution in concrete member which is away from the anchorage and in the region of the anchorage will be ____________
a) Non uniform
b) Zero
c) Constant
d) Uniform
d
3. The tensile stresses which tend to split the concrete are placed in the transverse direction to the ____________
a) Edge of member
b) Span of member
c) Axis of member
d) End of member
c
4. The bursting tensile forces in end bocks with proportion Pi is given as ____________
a) Fbst = Pi(0.32-0.3(ypo/yo))
b) Fbst = fi(0.32-0.3(ypo/yo))
c) Fbst = Ti(0.32-0.3(ypo/yo))
