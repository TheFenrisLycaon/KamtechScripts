b) Prestressing force and combined loads
c) Prestressing force and transverse loads
d) Prestressing force and tangential loads
c
2. The rotation equation obtained by applying Mohr’s theorem considering a concrete beam of span l, force p, eccentricity e is?
a) θp = PeL/2EI
b) θp = PeL/4EI
c) θp = PeL/16EI
d) θp = PeL/20EI
a
3. The cross section of a prestressed concrete beam is 100mm wide and 300mm deep and the initial stress in tendons are located at a eccentricity of 50mm is 1000n/mm2, the sectional area is 100mm2. Find rotation due to prestress (hogging moment)?
a) 0.00155
b) 0.00165
c) 0.00175
d) 0.00185
d
Prestressing force p = (1000×100) = 105 = 100kn
Rotation due to prestressing force θp = PeL/2EI = (100×50×6×103/2×36×225×106)
Hogging moment = 0.00185radians.
4. In the elastic range, any increase in prestressed member does not show any effect on ____________
a) Steel stress
b) Compressive stress
c) Bending stress
d) Flexural stress
a
5. The rate of increase in stress in the tendons of a prestress concrete member depends upon ____________
a) Bond and breakage
b) Bond and surrounding concrete
c) Bond and elasticity
d) Bond and anchorage
b
6. A prestressed concrete beam used over a span of 6m is 100mm wide and 300mm deep, live load of 4kn/m, density of concrete is 24kn/m3, modulus of elasticity of concrete is 36 and steel is 210kn/mm2. Find rotation due to loads(sagging moment)?
a) 0.005
b) 0.00525
c) 0.0024
d) 0.0045
d
Live load on the beam (q) = 4kn/m, Total load on the beam, Wd = (q+g) = (4+0.72) = 0.00472kn/mm
Rotation due to prestressing force θp = PeL/24EI = (100×50×6×103/24×36×210×106)
Sagging moment = 0.00525radians.
