b) 4
c) 2
d) 12
b
3. The expression for transmission length based on wedge action is given as?
a) Lt = ϕ/2μ (1+μc) (αc/μs-fpi/Ec) (fpe/2fpi-fpe)
b) Lt = ϕ/2μ (1+μc) (αc/μs-fpi/Ec)
c)  Lt = ϕ/2μ (1+μc)
d) Lt = ϕ/2μ
a
4. The transmission length is predicted considering the equation parameters varying from __________
a) 90 to 150ϕ
b) 100 to 200ϕ
c) 80 to 160ϕ
d) 20 to 60ϕ
c
5. Which one of the empirical formula is used for predicting transmission length?
a) Lt = ((fcu)1/2 x 103/β)1/2
b) Lt = ((fcu)1/2 x 103/β)
c) Lt = (fcu)1/2 x 103
d) Lt = (fcu)1/2
a
 Lt  = ((fcu)1/2 x 103/β)1/2, Lt = transmission length in mm, fcu = cube strength of concrete at transfer in n/mm2, β = constant depends on the strand and wire, the transmission length changes with time due to the effect of creep and shrinkage of the concrete.
6. The transmission length prevailing at the time of transfer does not remain __________
a) Zero
b) Constant
c) Without reaction
d) With reaction
b
7. The surface of drawn round wires is roughened by __________
a) Pickling
b) Bending
c) Bonding
d) Tensioning
a
8. The Shear bonding is obtained by cold rolling of __________
a) Square indentations
b) Rectangle indentations
c) Elliptical indentations
d) Circular indentations
c
9. According to Ros, the transmission length of smooth round wires of 1.5-5mm diameter varies approximately from __________
a) 1500-600
b) 100-300
c) 200-100
d) 1100-800
b
10. Estimate the transmission length at the ends of a pretensioned beam prestressed by 7mm diameter wires. Assume the cube strength of concrete at transfer as 42n/mm2 (adopt empirical method)?
a) 550mm
b) 610mm
c) 420mm
d) 210mm
b
7mm diameter smooth wires, β = 0.0174, fcu = 42n/mm2, Lt = ((42)1/2 x 103/ 0.0174) = 610mm = 87ϕ.
