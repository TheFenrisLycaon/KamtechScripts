1. The transverse tensile stress in transmission zone is developed due to concentration of ____________
a) Anchorages
b) Tendons
c) Jacks
d) Prestressing
b
2. The transverse tensile stresses are found to be maximum near ____________
a) Centroidal section
b) Mid span section
c) End zone section
d) Shaft cracking
b
3. The method of distributing tendons at the ends has a greater influence on ____________
a) Mid zone cracking
b) End zone cracking
c) Equivalent cracking
d) Shaft cracking
b
4. The problem of end zone cracking in pretensioned I beams has been experimentally investigated by ____________
a) Warren Hastings
b) Albert
c) Mattock
d) Thindle
c
5. The tensile stress is determined by the empirical equation of the type?
a) fv = KM/bwd2
b) KR/bwd2
c) KE/bwd2
d) KW/bwd2
a
fv– Transverse tensile stress at centroid of the end face, M – Resulting bending moment between the prestress force and internal prestress developed in the concrete on the centroidal axis, bw = thickness of web, d = overall depth of beam, K = constant depending upon the slope and distribution of tendons at the ends.
6. The transverse tensile stress distribution in transfer zones can be computed by an expression of the type?
a) 10M/bwhLt (1-x/Lt) e-3.5xLt 
b) 10M/bwhLt (1-x/Lt)
c) 10M/bwhLt
d) M/bwhLt
b
Lt = transmission length, x = distance from end face.
7. The magnitude of maximum tensile stresses found to occur at the centroid of end face when x is zero is ____________
a) 10M/bwhLt
b) 10M/bwhLt
c) 20M/bwhLt
d) 30M/bwhLt
a
 fv(max) = 10M/bwhLt,
M = moment, Lt = transmission length.
8. The creep coefficient of the concrete varies from ____________
a) 1 to 6
b) 1 to 3
c) 1 to 9
d) 1 to 12
b
9. The term iw in a section of I beam is termed as ____________
a) Thickness of web
b) Depth of web
c) Self weight of I section
d) Total weight of I section
a
10. A time dependent deformation of concrete is termed as ____________
a) Shrinkage
b) Creep
c) Final stress
d) Strain
b
