1. How many types of modes of shear cracking are present in structural concrete beams?
a) 4
b) 2
c) 5
d) 8
b
2. The web shear cracks generally start from __________
a) Interior point
b) Exterior point
c) Edge
d) Mid span
a
3. The web shear cracks are developed when the beam is subjected to __________
a) Point load
b) Concentrated loads
c) Shear loads
d) Uniformly distributed load
b
4. In which direction the flexural cracks are first initiated?
a) Straight
b) Inclined
c) Bended
d) Dotted
c
5. What is provided in order to protect a member from collapsing suddenly after the development of shear cracks?
a) Edge reinforcement
b) Principal reinforcement
c) Span reinforcement
d) Shear reinforcement
d
Asv/bsv = 0.4/0.87fy
In member without shear reinforcement, the inclined shear cracks extend to the compression face resulting in sudden explosive failure this is sometimes referred to as the diagonal tensile modes of failure.
6. The ultimate shear resistance of prestressed concrete with web shear cracking but without flexural crakes & mainly governed by __________
a) Limiting value
b) Constant value
c) Zero
d) Infinity
a
7. The relation for computing the ultimate shear force is given as __________
a) Vcw = bw dp((0.3λ)fcy1/2 – 0.3fcp) + vp
b) Vcw = bw dp((0.3λ)fcy1/2 + 0.3fcp) + vp
c) Vcw = bw dp(0.3λ + vp)
d) Vcw = bw dp
b
Bw = breadth of web, dp = effective depth to tender or 0.8h, λ = 1.0 for nominal weight concrete and less for light weight concrete, fcy = cylinder compressive strength of concrete(n/mm2), fcp = compressive prestress at centroid of a section, vp = the vertical component of the effective prestressing force at section.
8. The ultimate shear resistance vcf of section cracked in flexure is expressed as __________
a) vcf = (1-0.55fpc/fp)τ cbwd+(m0/m)v
b) vcf = (1-0.55fpc/fp)τ cbwd
c) vcf = (1-0.55fpc/fp)
d) vcf = (1-0.55fpc)
a
9. The flexure shear cracking load in a prestressed member is given by __________
a) ACI
b) Indian
c) British
d) Canada
a
10. According to Mast, a complete shear analysis is necessary only in beams of __________
a) High span
b) Mid span
c) Low span
d) Edge span
c
