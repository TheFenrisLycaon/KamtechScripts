1. The code used for determining the ultimate flexural strength of the rectangular section?
a) IS: 1444
b) IS: 1440
c) IS: 1343
d) IS: 1543
c
2. If the neutral axis of the section lies within the flange, the moment of resistance of the section is given by the equation.
a) Mu = fp ap (d-0.42Xu)
b) Mu = fp ap (d+0.42Xu)
c) Mu = fp ap (0.42Xu)
d) Mu = fp ap (0.52Xu)
a
3. In pre tension & post tension members, the value of tensile stress fp and depth of neutral axis Xu is obtained based on __________
a) Shear reinforcement
b) Effective reinforcement
c) Edge reinforcement
d) Span reinforcement
b
4. If the neutral axis of the section lies outside the flange then the ultimate moment of resistance of flanged section is?
a) Mu = fp Apw (d-0.4 xu)+0.45fck (b-bw) Df (d-0.5Df)
b) Mu = fp Apw (d-0.4 xu)+0.45fck (b-bw)
c) Mu = fp Apw (d-0.4 xu)
d) Mu = fp Apw
a
Where Apw = area of prestressing steel for web (Ap-Apf), Apf = area of prestressing steel for flange (0.45fck (b-bw) (df/f), f = characteristic tensile strength of the prestressing steel, df = flange thickness, b = width of beam, bw = width of web after considering are the cases in the tendon, the effective prestress fpc should be greater than 0.45f.
5. The number of steps involved in designing a rectangular prestressed concrete beam are __________
a) 8
b) 14
c) 6
d) 1
c
6. The section modulus z, of designing a rectangular prestressed concrete beam is given as __________
a) Z = ML/FC
b) Z = Me/Fc
c) Z = MC/FC
d) Z = Md/Fc
a
7. The position of reinforcement of a recta ngular prestressed concrete beam is evaluated from the relations.
a) e = 2Md-Mc/2F
b) e = 2Md-Me/2F
c) e = 2Md+Mc/2F
d) e = 2Md+Me/2F
d
Asv/bsv = 0.4/0.8fy.
8. The number of steps are involved in designing a prestressed concrete beam of I section is?
a) 14
b) 10
c) 12
d) 8
a
9. The overall depth in a beam of I section is given as?
a) d = k(me)1/2
b) d = k(mt)1/2
c) d = k(ml)1/2
d) d = k(ma)1/2
b
d = k(mt)1/2  k-coefficient,
The value ranges in between 30-45 adopt average value, this is the seventh step used in designing the I section.
10. The area of tendons` At` is given as __________
a) At = F/Safe tensile stress in steel
b) At = L/Safe tensile stress in steel
c) At = D/Safe tensile stress in steel
d) At = C/Safe tensile stress in steel
a
