1. A population has N items. Samples of size n are selected without replacement. Find the number of possible samples.
a) NCn
b) nCN
c) 2n
d) 2N
a
2. Find the number of all possible samples from a population containing 8 items from which 2 items are selected at random without replacement.
a) 56
b) 28
c) 66
d) 38
b
3. A bag contains 6 balls of different colours. A student selects 2 balls at random without replacement. Find all possible combinations of the colours of the selected balls.
a) 13
b) 14
c) 15
d) 16
c
4. Consider a population containing N items and n are selected as a sample with replacement. Find all the possible samples.
a) N
b) nN
c) NCn
d) Nn
d
5. A bag contains 6 pairs of socks. If 2 pairs of socks are selected at random with replacement then the number of possible samples is?
a) 6
b) 12
c) 36
d) 216
c
Here N = 6 and n = 2.
Hence samples are Nn = 62 = 36.
6. Find the sampling fraction where N is population size and n is the sample size?
a) n/N
b) NCn
c) nN
d) Nn
a
7. In random sampling the probability of selecting an item from a population is unknown.
a) True
b) False
b
8. In a sampling distribution the population correction factor is given by?
a) (N-1/N-n)1/2
b) (N-n/N-1)1/2
c) (n-1/N-n)1/2
d) (N-1/n-1)1/2
b
9. A population has 10 items and a sample has been selected from it containing 5 items. Find the finite population correction factor.
a) (5/8)1/2
b) (5/7)1/2
c) (5/9)1/2
d) (5/6)1/2
c
(N-n/N-1)1/2
(10-5/10-1)1/2
(5/9)1/2
which gives the value of correction factor as (5/9)1/2. 
10. Find the value of standard error Ẋ in a sampling distribution with replacement. Given that standard deviation of the population of 16 items is 8.
a) 3
b) 4
c) 2
d) 5
c
Ẋ = σ/(n)1/2
Ẋ = 8/(16)1/2
which gives the value of Ẋ = 2.
