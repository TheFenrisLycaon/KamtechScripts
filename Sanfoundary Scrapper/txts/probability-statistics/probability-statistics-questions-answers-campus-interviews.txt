1. The probability of selecting a sample containing n items from a population with N items without replacement in a Sampling Distribution is?
a) 1/NCn
b) 1/nCN
c) 1/2n
d) 1/2N
a
2. Find the number of all possible samples from a population containing 18 items from which 6 items are selected at random without replacement.
a) 18564
b) 15864
c) 20264
d) 21564
a
3. A pack of cards contains 52 cards. A player selects 4 cards at random without replacement. Find all possible combinations of the cards selected.
a) 207752
b) 270752
c) 270725
d) 207725
c
4. A population contains N items out of which n items are selected with replacement. Find the probability of the sample being selected.
a) 1/N
b) 1/nN
c) 1/NCn
d) 1/Nn
d
5. A box contains 26 pairs of napkins. If 3 pairs of napkins are selected at random with a replacement then the number of possible samples is _______
a) 17675
b) 17566
c) 17576
d) 17556
c
Here N = 26 and n = 3.
Hence samples are Nn = 263 = 17576.
6. A sample was formed consisting of 8 students from a total of 56 students for certain task. Find the sampling fraction of the population of students.
a) 1/7
b) 7
c) 49
d) 1/49
a
7. Find the population proportion p for an IPL team having total 30 players with 10 overseas players.
a) 1/2
b) 1/3
c) 2/3
d) 1/4
b
8. It is provided that for a sampling distribution E(X)=11 and ϕ=13. Find the bias in the sampling.
a) 2
b) 4
c) 6
d) 3
a
|11 – 13| = 2
Hence bias is 2.
9. Find the standard error of population proportion p for sampling with replacement. The population proportion is 0.5 and size of sample is 4.
a) 0.5
b) 0.25
c) 0.225
d) 0.375
b
[0.5*(1-0.5)/4]1/2
= 0.25.
10. Find the value of standard error Ẋ in a sampling distribution without replacement. Given that the standard deviation of the population of 100 items is 25.
a) 3
b) 4
c) 2
d) 5
c
Hence n = 100 and σ = 25
Ẋ = σ/(n)1/2
Ẋ = 25/(100)1/2
Ẋ = 2.5
The value of Ẋ = 2.5.
