Test the hypothesis that the dice is unbiased (X2 = 11.7). Calculate the frequency observed for Chi Square distribution.
a) Dice is unbiased, 11.3
b) Dice is biased, 12.9
c) Dice is unbiased, 10.9
d) Dice is biased, 12.3
b
Step 2: Calculation of Expected frequency:
Since the dice is unbiased P(r) = 1/6.
r = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Expected frequency f(r) = N*r = 120* 1/6 = 20
Step3: Calculation of X2
X2 \(=∑\frac{[(fe-fo)]^2}{fe} \) 
Hence X2 = 12.90 > 11.90.
Thus dice is biased.
2. Consider a set of 18 samples from a standard normal distribution. We square each sample and sum all the squares. The number of degrees of freedom for a Chi Square distribution will be?
a) 17
b) 18
c) 19
d) 20
b
Here total number of standard normal derivatives = 18.
Hence the number of degrees of freedom for a Chi Square distribution = 18. 
3. What is the mean of a Chi Square distribution with 6 degrees of freedom?
a) 4
b) 12
c) 6
d) 8
c
Degrees of freedom = 6.
Hence mean = 6.
4. Which Chi Square distribution looks the most like a normal distribution?
a) A Chi Square distribution with 4 degrees of freedom
b) A Chi Square distribution with 5 degrees of freedom
c) A Chi Square distribution with 6 degrees of freedom
d) A Chi Square distribution with 16 degrees of freedom
d
5. A bag contains 80 chocolates. This bag has 4 different colors of chocolates in it. If all four colors of chocolates were equally likely to be put in the bag, what would be the expected number of chocolates of each color?
a) 12
b) 11
c) 20
d) 9
c
N = 80, r = 1/4
 So, the expected frequency = N*r = (1/4)*(80) = 20. 
6. Suppose a person has 8 red, 5 green, 12 orange, and 15 blue balls. Test the null hypothesis that the colors of the balls occur with equal frequency. What is the Chi Square value you get?
a) 5.6
b) 5.68
c) 5.86
d) 5.8
d
Observed frequency f0= (8+5+12+15)/4 = 10
X2 =\(∑\frac{[(fe-fo)]^2}{fe} \) 
The sum of each (expected – observed)2/expected = (10-8)2/10 + (10-5)2/10 + (10-12)2/10 + (10-15)2/10 = 5.8.
7. A faculty is interested in whether there is a relationship between gender and subject at his college. He tabulated some men and women on campus and asked them if their subject was Mathematics (M), Geography (G), and Science (S). What would be the expected frequency of women in Geography based on this table?

Infer or not the local option on the sale of liquor is dependent on individual drinker? Find the value of X2 for degrees of freedom at level of significance 3.841.
a) 0.957
b) 0.975
c) 0.759
d) 0.795
a
Step 2: Calculation of theoretical frequencies (Expected)
Expected frequency of (1,1) cell
fe11 = 87*74/111 = 58
fe12 = 87*37/111 = 29
fe21 = 24*74/111 = 16
fe22 = 24*32/111 = 8
Step 3: calculation of X2 distribution we know that
X2 =\( ∑\frac{[(fe-fo)]^2}{fe} \) 
X2 = 0.957 < 3.841.
Hence the null hypothesis is accepted
Thus the sale of liquor does not depend on the individual drinker.
