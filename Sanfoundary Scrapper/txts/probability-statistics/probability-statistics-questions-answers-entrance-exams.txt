1. If the mean of population is 29 then the mean of sampling distribution is __________
a) 29
b) 30
c) 21
d) 31
a
2. In systematic sampling, population is 240 and selected sample size is 60 then sampling interval is ________
a) 240
b) 60
c) 4
d) 0.25
c
3. The method of selecting a desirable portion from a population which describes the characteristics of whole population is called as ________
a) sampling
b) segregating
c) dividing
d) implanting
a
4. If the standard deviation of a population is 50 and the sample size is 16 then the standard deviation of the sampling distribution is ________
a) 11.25
b) 12.25
c) 13.25
d) 14.25
b
Substituting the values of n=16 and σ=50.
σ/(n)1/2
50/(16)1/2
we get ϕ=12.25.
5. In sampling distribution what does the parameter k represents ________

d

b) variance of population
c) sample of population
d) mean of population
d
7. The cluster sampling, stratified sampling or systematic samplings are types of ________
a) direct sampling
b) indirect sampling
c) random sampling
d) non random sampling
c
8. Which of the following is classified as unknown or exact value that represents the whole population?
a) predictor
b) guider
c) parameter
d) estimator
c
9. A sample size is considered large in which of the following cases?
a) n > or = 30
b) n > or = 50
c) n < or = 30
d) n < or = 50
a
10. The selected clusters in a clustering sampling are known as ________
a) elementary units
b) primary units
c) secondary units
d) proportional units
a
