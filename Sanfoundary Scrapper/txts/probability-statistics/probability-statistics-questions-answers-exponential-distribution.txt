1. The mean of exponential distribution is given as __________
a) 1/λ
b) λ
c) λ2
d) 1/λ2
a
E(X)=1/λ.
2. A mobile conversation follows a exponential distribution f (x) = (1/3)e-x/3. What is the probability that the conversation takes more than 5 minutes?
a) e-5/3
b) e-15
c) 5e-15
d) e-5/3
a
\(\frac{1}{3} ∫ (e^{-x/3}dx) = \frac{1}{3}(\frac{- e^{-5/3}}{-1/3}) \) 
= e-5/3. 
3. Exponential distribution is bi-variate.
a) True
b) False
b
It is only defined for non-negative variables.
4. A random variable X has an exponential distribution with probability distribution function is given by
f(x)= 3e-3x for x>0 = 0 otherwise
Find probability that X is not less than 2.
a) e-3
b) e-6 – 3
c) e-6
d) e-6 – 1
c
P(X > 2) = 1 – P(X < 2) = Integrating the function from 0 to 2 we get
P(X = 1) = 1 – [3(e0 – e-6)/(-3)] 
= e-6.
5. Consider a random variable with exponential distribution with λ=1. Compute the probability for P (X>3).
a) e-3
b) e-1
c) e-2
d) e-4
a
P(X > 3) = 1 – P(X < 3)
= 1 – (1 – e-3)
= e-3.
