1. The mean of the f – distribution is equal to ___________
a)  v2 / (v2 – 2) for v2 > 2
b)  v2 / (v2 – 2)2 for v2 > 2
c)  v2 / (v2 – 2)3 for v2 > 2
d)  v2 / (v2 – 2)-1 for v2 > 2
a
2. Variance is equal to [(v1 + v2 – 2)] / [v1 * (v2 – 2)2 * (v2 – 4)] for v2 > 4 for a f-Distribution.
a) True
b) False
b
3. Which of the following distributions is Continuous?
a) Binomial Distribution
b) Hyper-geometric Distribution
c) F-Distribution
d) Poisson Distribution
c
4. Which of the following distributions is used to compare two variances?
a) T – Distribution
b) F – Distribution
c) Normal Distribution
d) Poisson Distribution
b
5. F-Distribution cannot take negative values.
a) True
b) False
a
6. Find Variance for an F-Distribution with v1=5 and v2=9.
a) 1.587
b) 1.378
c) 1.578
d) 1.498
a
Var(X) = [2 * \(v_2^2\) * (v1 + v2 – 2)] / [v1 * (v2 – 2)2 * (v2 – 4)] for v2 > 4 where v1 and v2 denote the degrees of freedom of f-Distribution.
Hence Var(X) = [2 * 92 * (14 – 2)] / [5 * (9 – 2)2 * (9- 4)]  =  1.587. 
7. The table shows the standard Deviation and Sample Standard Deviation for both men and women. Find the f statistic considering the Men population in numerator.
Population
Population Standard Deviation
Sample Standard Deviation
Men
30
35
Women
50
45
a) 2.68
b) 1.34
c) 1.68
d) 1.34
c
f = [s12/σ12]/[s22/σ22].
where σ1 is the standard deviation of population 1
 s1 is the standard deviation of the sample drawn from population 1
 σ2 is the standard deviation of population 2
 s1 is the standard deviation of the sample drawn from population 2.
f = (352/302)/(452/502)
f = (1225/900)/(2025/2500)
f = 1.361/0.81 = 1.68. 
8. Calculate the value of f-statistic having a cumulative probability of 0.95.
a) 0.55
b) 0.5
c) 0.05
d) 0.05
d
If f – statistic =  f α then, cumulative probability = (1 – α)
Hence, for cumulative probability 0.95
f – statistic  = (1 – 0.95) = 0.05.
9. There is only 1 parameter in F-Distribution.
a) True
b) False
b
10. Find the Expectation for a F- Distribution variable with v1 = 7 and  v2 =  8.
a) 4/7
b) 4/6
c) 4/3
d) 4/5
c
E(X) = v2 / (v2 – 2) for v2 > 2
Hence, E(X) = 8 / (8-2)
E(X) = 4/3.
