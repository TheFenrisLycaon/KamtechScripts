1. In a Poisson Distribution, if ‘n’ is the number of trials and ‘p’ is the probability of success, then the mean value is given by?
a) m = np
b) m = (np)2
c) m = np(1-p)
d) m = p
a
Mean(μ)=\(\sum_{x=0}^n xp(x)\) 
For Poisson Distribution P(x)=\(\frac{e^{-m}m^x}{x!}\) substitute in above equation and solve to get µ = m = np.
2. If ‘m’ is the mean of a Poisson Distribution, then variance is given by ___________
a) m2
b) m1⁄2
c) m
d) m⁄2
c
Variance (v) = \(\sum_{x=0}^n x^2p(x)-\mu^2\)  
Where µ is the mean, substitute P(x)=\(\frac{e^{-m}m^x}{x!}\), in the above equation and put µ = m to obtain
V = m.
3. The p.d.f of Poisson Distribution is given by ___________
a) \(\frac{e^{-m}m^x}{x!}\) 
b) \(\frac{e^{-m}x!}{m^x}\) 
c) \(\frac{x!}{m^xe^{-m}}\) 
d) \(\frac{e^m m^x}{x!}\) 
a
Even though if you are interested to know the derivation in detail, you can refer to any of the books or source on internet that speaks of this matter.
4. If ‘m’ is the mean of a Poisson Distribution, the standard deviation is given by ___________
a) \(\sqrt{m}\) 
b) m2
c) m
d) m⁄2
a
Standard Deviation = \(\sqrt{variance} = \sqrt{m}\) 
5. In a Poisson Distribution, the mean and variance are equal.
a) True
b) False
a
Variance = m
∴ Mean = Variance.
6. In a Poisson Distribution, if mean (m) = e, then P(x) is given by ___________
a) \(\frac{e^{(x-m)}}{x!}\) 
b) \(\frac{e^{(m-x)}}{x!}\) 
c) \(\frac{x!}{e^{(m-x)}}\) 
d) \(\frac{x!}{e^{(x-m)}}\) 
b
Put m = e, and get correct solution.
7. Poisson distribution is applied for ___________
a) Continuous Random Variable
b) Discrete Random Variable
c) Irregular Random Variable
d) Uncertain Random Variable
b
8. If ‘m’ is the mean of Poisson Distribution, the P(0) is given by ___________
a) e-m
b) em
c) e
d) m-e
a
Put x = 0, to obtain e-m.
9. In a Poisson distribution, the mean and standard deviation are equal.
a) True
b) False
b
Mean = m
Standard Deivation = m1⁄2
∴ Mean and Standard deviation are not equal.
10. For a Poisson Distribution, if mean(m) = 1, then P(1) is?
a) 1/e
b) e
c) e/2
d) Indeterminate
a
Put m = x = 1, (given) to obtain 1/e.
11. The recurrence relation between P(x) and P(x +1) in a Poisson distribution is given by ___________
a) P(x+1) – m P(x) = 0
b) m P(x+1) – P(x) = 0
c) (x+1) P(x+1) – m P(x) = 0
d) (x+1) P(x) – x P(x+1) = 0
c
p(x+1) = e-1 mx+1 /(x + 1)!
Divide P(x+1) by P(x) and rearrange to obtain (x+1) P(x+1) – m P(x) = 0.
