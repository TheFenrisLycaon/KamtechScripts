1. How many parameters are there in Weibull distribution?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
2. Weibull distribution gives the failure rate proportional to the power of time.
a) True
b) False
a
3. In Weibull distribution, if the value of β equal us equal to one that indicates the failure rate is constant over time.
a) True
b) False
a
Explanation In Weibull distribution for β < 1 failure rate that decreases with time. β = 1 have a constant failure rate. β > 1 have a failure rate that increases with time.
4. For β greater than 1 there is an inflection point for Weibull function at ___________
a) (e1/β-1)/e1/β-1
b) (e1/β-1)/e1/β
c) (e1/β-1)/e1/β-2
d) (e1/β-1)/e1/β-5
b
5. How can we increase the height of the graph of Weibull distribution?
a) if η  is decreased while β and γ  are constant
b) if η  is increased while β and γ  are constant
c) if η  is constant while β and γ  are increased
d) if η  is constant while β and γ  are decreased
a
6. What is the effect of the threshold parameter γ on the graph of Weibull distribution?
a) graph shift to left or right
b) graph shifts up or down
c) height of the graph decreases
d) height of the graph increases
a
7. What is the mean time to failure if time to failure of a gadget follows Weibull distribution with scale = 1000 hours and shape = 0.5?
a) 2500 hours
b) 1500 hours
c) 3000 hours
d) 2000 hours
d
Mean time to failure is given by
1000 × Γ (1+1/0.5)
1000 × 2 = 2000 hours.
8. The mean time of failure is given by the equation __________
a) E(X) = Γ(1/ 2β + 1)
b) E(X) = Γ(1/ β + 1)
c) E(X) = Γ(1/ β + 2)
d) E(X) = Γ(2/ β + 1)
b
9. The time to failure of an electric bulb follows a Weibull distribution with scale = 2000 hours and shape = 0.5. What is the probability that the electric bulb will last more than 4000 hours? What is the mean time to failure?
a) 25.3%
b) 24.3%
c) 26.3%
d) 27.3%
b
The probability that the bulb will last no more than 3000 hours = WEIBULL (3000, 0.75, 1000, True) = 0.757
Probability that the bulb will last more than 4000 hours = 1 – 0.757 = 24.3%.
10. γ in Weibull distribution graph indicates _________
a) earliest time of failure
b) maximum time of failure
c) shape of the graph
d) scale of the graph
