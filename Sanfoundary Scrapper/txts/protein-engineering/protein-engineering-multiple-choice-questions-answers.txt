Formula:
Monoisotopic mass=[no. of carbon atoms x (C°) + no. of hydrogen atoms x (H°) + no. of oxygen atoms x (O°) + no. of nitrogen atoms x (N°)] 
Hence, the monoisotopic mass of valine=5 x (12.000) + 7 x (1.0078) + (15.9949) + (14.0031)
monoisotopic mass of valine = 99.068
The chemical formula of valine is C5H9ON
Formula:
Average mass=[no. of carbon atoms x (C) + no. of hydrogen atoms x (H) + no. of oxygen atoms x (O) + no. of nitrogen atoms x (N)]
