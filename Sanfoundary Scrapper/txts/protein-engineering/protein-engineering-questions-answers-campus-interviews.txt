a) Twenty-four
b) Nine
c) Sixteen
d) Twenty-seven
d
Formula: n=xy
Where x=number of different amino acids used,
y=number amino acid positions in the peptides.
Hence, n=33
n=27.

a) 1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
b) Piperidine
c) Fluorobenzene
d) Trifluoroacetic acid
d
12. If the yield for each amino acid addition in SPPS is 99.99 % then, what will be the overall yield of a 50 amino acid peptide?
a) 98.2 %
b) 99.1 %
c) 99.9 %
d) 99.5 %
d
Formula: Y=y x (\(\frac{y}{100}\))n-1
Where Y=the overall yield
y=yield for each amino acid addition
n=number of amino acids in the peptide
Hence, Y=99.99 x (\(\frac{99.99}{100}\))50-1
Y=99.5%.
