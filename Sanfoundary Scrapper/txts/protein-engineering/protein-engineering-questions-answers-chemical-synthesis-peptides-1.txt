d) Peptides
d
2. Which of the following is not a use of peptide?
a) Drugs
b) Food supplement
c) Diagnosis of disease
d) Storage of genetic information
d
3. Peptides are very easy to synthesize in the lab.
a) True
b) False
b
4. Who discovered the process of Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis?

a) Protection
b) Deprotection
c) Coupling
d) Attaching an amino acid to the polymer
d
6. With the help of which of the following the amino acid is attached to the polymer support?
a) Building agent
b) Synthesis agent
c) Protecting agent
d) Linkage agent
d
7. Which of the following amino acid contains side chains that require protection?
a) Glycine
b) Valine
c) Alanine
d) Glutamic acid
d
8. What is the process in which the basic group of one amino acid and the acidic group of the other are both made unable to react?
a) Desensitization
b) Prohibition
c) Restriction
d) Protection
d
9. Strong acids and bases are used in the peptide synthesis.
a) True
b) False
b
10. Peptide synthesis is a very time-consuming process.
a) False
b) True
b
11. There are no environmental implications for the SPPS method.
a) True
b) False
b
12. If solutions containing two amino acids are mixed, then how many different dipeptides can be formed?
a) One
b) Two
c) Three
d) Four
d
Formula: n=xy
Where x=number of different amino acids used,
y=number amino acid positions in the peptides.
Hence, n=22
n=4.
13. Which of the following compound is used to protect the amino side chain of amino acids?
a) 6-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl
b) 9-fluorenylethoxycarbonyl
c) 6-fluorenylethoxycarbonyl
d) 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl
d
14. Amino acids containing aromatic, acidic, basic, or highly polar side chains are likely to be non-reactive.
a) True
b) False
b
15. How many combinations of dipeptides can be formed if three solutions of different amino-acids are mixed?
a) Six
b) Sixteen
c) Twenty-seven
d) Nine
d
Formula: n=xy
Where x=number of different amino acids used,
y=number amino acid positions in the peptides.
Hence, n=32
n=9.
