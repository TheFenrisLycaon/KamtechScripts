d
15. If the energy required to break all non-covalent interactions between two molecules is 750 kJ/mol, then what is the total number of hydrogen bonds present between them? (Assume there are only hydrogen bonds between them and the bond energy of each hydrogen bond is 15 kJ/mol)
a) 11,250
b) 25
c) 100
d) 50
d
Formula: No. of bonds(n)=\(\frac{Total \, Energy \, Required \, To \, Break \, All\, Bonds }{Energy \, of \, Single \, Bond}\) 
n=\(\frac{750}{15}\) 
n=50.
