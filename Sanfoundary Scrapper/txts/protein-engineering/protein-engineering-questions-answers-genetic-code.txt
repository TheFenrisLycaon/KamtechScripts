c) DNA → protein → RNA
d) DNA → RNA → protein
d
2. Who proposed the central dogma?
a) Louis Pasteur
b) Gregor Mendel
c) Francis Collins
d) Francis Crick
d
3. What is the genetic code?
a) Code of enzymatic analysis of genes
b) Code of genome sequencing
c) The message stored in proteins for the synthesis of DNA
d) The message stored in DNA for the synthesis of proteins
d
4. What is a codon?
a) A single base necessary to specify a single amino acid
b) A group of two bases necessary to specify a single amino acid
c) A group of three bases necessary to specify a single amino acid
d) A group of several bases necessary to specify a single amino acid.
d
5. If a codon contains four bases, then how many possible codons can be formed utilizing the four most commonly occurring bases?
a) 16
b) 64
c) 704
d) 256
d
Formula: p=4n
Where p is the number of possible codons, n is the number of bases in a codon.
p=44
p=256.

a) False
b) True
b
7. Which of the following gives the correct characteristics of the genetic code?
a) Duplet, overlapping, and degenerate
b) Duplet, non-overlapping, and degenerate
c) Triplet, overlapping, and degenerate
d) Triplet, non-overlapping, degenerate
d
8. Which of the following mutation is known as frameshift mutation?
a) All mutations
b) Only the deletion of single nucleotide
c) Only addition of a single nucleotide
d) Both addition and deletion of single nucleotide
d
9. The genetic code has no punctuation to indicate the reading frame; instead, the nucleotide sequence is read sequentially, triplet by triplet?
a) False
b) True
b
10. Which of the following is the start codon?
a) CUC
b) ACC/CCA
c) GUA
d) AUG/GUG
d
11. Which amino acid does AUG code for?
a) Cysteine
b) Valine
c) Glycine
d) Methionine
d
12. Find the odd one out?
a) UAA
b) UAG
c) UGA
d) AUG
d
13. Which of the following codons are known as non-sense codons?
a) UGA only
b) UAG only
c) UAA only
d) UGA, UAG, and UAA
d
14. What are the codons that specify the same amino acid called?
a) Stop codons
b) Start codons
c) Acronyms
d) Synonyms
d
15. The “standard” genetic code is almost universal?
a) False
b) True
b
