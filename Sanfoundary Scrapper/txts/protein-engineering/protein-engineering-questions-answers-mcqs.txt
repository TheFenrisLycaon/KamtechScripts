9. The wavelength of X – rays used in X – ray crystallography is 8 x 10-10 m. It undergoes the first-order reflection at a glancing angle of 4.59°. What is the spacing between the atomic planes?
a) 4 x 10-9 m
b) 15 x 10-9 m
c) 10 x 10-9 m
d) 5 x 10-9 m
d
Formula: 2dsinθ=nλ (Bragg’s law)
Where, d=spacing of the atomic planes in the crystal,
θ=glancing angle,
n=order of reflection,
λ=wavelength.
Therefore,  d=\(\frac{n\lambda}{2sin\theta}\) 
d=\(\frac{1 \times 8 \times 10^{-10}}{2 \times sin (4.59)}\) 
d≈5 x 10-9 m.
10. An X – ray having a wavelength of 1.67 x 10-10 undergoes the first-order reflection. What is the glancing angle (θ) if the spacing between the two planes is 6 x 10-10?
a) 6.25°
b) 8.99°
c) 7°
d) 8°
d
Formula: 2dsinθ=nλ (Bragg’s law)
Where, d=spacing of the atomic planes in the crystal,
θ=glancing angle,
n=order of reflection,
λ=wavelength.
Therefore,  sinθ=\(\frac{n\lambda}{2d}\) 
sinθ=\(\frac{1.67 \times 10^{-10}}{2 \times 6 \times 10^{-10}}\) 
sinθ=0.139167
θ≈8°.
11. If a beam of X – ray has a wavelength of 1 A°, then what is the energy of this wave?
a) 39.78 x 10-16erg
b) 19.89 x 10-16erg
c) 39.78 x 10-16J
d) 19.89 x 10-16J
d
Formula: E=hf=\(\frac{hc}{\lambda}\) 
Where, E=Energy of the wave,
h=plank’s constant=6.63 x 10-34m2/kg.s,
c=speed of light=3 x 108m/s,
λ=wavelength.
Therefore, E=\(\frac{hc}{\lambda}\)=\(\frac{6.63 \times 10^{-34} \times 3 \times 10^8}{10^{-10}}\)(m2/kg.s)x(m/s)÷m
E=19.89 x 10-16 kg.m2/s2.
E=19.89 x 10-16J.
12. Which of the following phenomenon is depicted in the figure shown below?
a) Diffraction
b) Non-interference
c) Constructive interference
d) Destructive interference
d
13. Which of the following phenomenon is depicted in the figure shown below?
a) Diffraction

b) 9.523 x 1018 Hz
c) 8.523 x 1018 Hz
d) 4.523 x 1018 Hz
d
Formula: E=hf=\(\frac{hc}{\lambda}\) 
Therefore, f=\(\frac{E}{h}\) 
f=\(\frac{30 \times 10^{-16}}{6.63 \times 10^{-34}}\) 
f≈4.523 x 1018 Hz.
15. In X – ray crystallography, the crystal is gradually rotated and a diffraction pattern is acquired for each distinct orientation.
