c) t=(\(\frac{m}{2v^{\circ}}\))2.0 x l
d) t=(\(\frac{m}{2v^{\circ}q}\))0.5 x l
d
Where, t is the time of flight,

12. Which of the following charge has the lowest m/z ratio?
Given data: q1 has a charge +1 and mass of 800 Da,
q2 has a charge +3 and mass of 3900 Da,
q3 has a charge +2 and mass of 2970 Da,
q4 has a charge +4 and a mass of 3480 Da.
a) q4
b) q3
c) q2
d) q1
d
Formula: \(\frac{m}{z}\)=\(\frac{mass \, of \, the \,ion}{charge \,on \,the \, ion}\) 
For q1\(\frac{m}{z}\)=\(\frac{800}{+1}\)=800
For q2\(\frac{m}{z}\)=\(\frac{3900}{+3}\)=1300
For q3\(\frac{m}{z}\)=\(\frac{2790}{+2}\)=1485
For q4\(\frac{m}{z}\)=\(\frac{3480}{+4}\)=870
Hence, the m/z ratio of q1 is lowest.

d
15. Consider four ions q1, q2, q3 and q4. q1 has a charge +3 and mass of 290 Da, q2 has a charge +2, and mass of 290 Da, q3 has a charge +3 and mass of 390 Da, and q4 has a charge +2 and mass of 390 Da. Which one of these ions has a maximum m/z ratio?
a) q1
b) q2
c) q3
d) q4
d
Formula: \(\frac{m}{z}\)=\(\frac{mass \, of \, the \,ion}{charge \,on \,the \, ion}\) 
For q1\(\frac{m}{z}\)=\(\frac{290}{+3}\)=96.66
For q2\(\frac{m}{z}\)=\(\frac{290}{+2}\)=145
For q3\(\frac{m}{z}\)=\(\frac{390}{+3}\)=130
For q4\(\frac{m}{z}\)=\(\frac{390}{+2}\)=195
Hence, the m/z ratio of q4 is maximum.
