11. What is the monoisotopic mass of glycine?
Given data: Mass of the most abundant isotope of Carbon (C°)=12.0000,
Mass of most abundant isotope of Hydrogen (H°)=1.0078,
Mass of most abundant isotope of Oxygen (O°)=15.9949,
Mass of most abundant isotope of Nitrogen (N°)=14.0031.
a) 99.0687
b) 87.2365
c) 57.052
d) 57.0214
d
The chemical formula of Glycine is C2H3ON
Formula:
Monoisotopic mass
=[no. of carbon atoms x (C°) + no. of hydrogen atoms x (H°)
 + no. of oxygen atoms x (O°) + no. of nitrogen atoms x (N°)] 
Hence, the monoisotopic mass of glycine=2 x (12.000) + 3 x (1.0078) + (15.9949) + (14.0031)
monoisotopic mass of glycine = 57.0214.
12. What is the average mass of glycine?
Given data: Average mass of Carbon (C)=12.011,
The average mass of Hydrogen (H)=1.008,
The average mass of Oxygen (O)=15.999,
The average mass of Nitrogen (N)=14.007.
a) 87.0320
b) 99.0656
c) 57.021
d) 57.052
d
The chemical formula of Glycine is C2H3ON
Formula:
Average mass=[no. of carbon atoms x (C) + no. of hydrogen atoms x (H)
 + no. of oxygen atoms x (O) + no. of nitrogen atoms x (N)] 
Hence, the Average mass of glycine=2 x (12.011) + 3 x (1.008) + (15.999) + (14.007)
The average mass of glycine=57.052.
