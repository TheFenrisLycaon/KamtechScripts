3.	If one ignores brightness, then a color plane that intersects through the space; such a diagram is known as chromaticity chart and takes into account hue and saturation.
a)	True
b)	False
a

a)	Red light
b)	Green light
c)	Pink light
d)	Orange light
b

a)	Monochromaticity
b)	Chromaticity
c)	Blindness

b
9.	__________ values could be obtained by the comparison method where the color is matched by mixing 3 primary standards until visual observation gives a match, spectrophotometric analysis, or utilize of trichromatic methods employing analysis with 3 separate filters.
a)	Chromaticity
b)	Kubelka
c)	Tristimulus
d)	Black body
c
where Blue, Green, and Red could be considered to be unit values for Blue, Green, and Red are the magnitudes or relative intensities of those primaries and are known as tristimulus values. Note that the unit values associated with Blue, Green, and Red are of various size in physical power units (watts) because the sensitivity of the eye will be various for the various primary colors.
