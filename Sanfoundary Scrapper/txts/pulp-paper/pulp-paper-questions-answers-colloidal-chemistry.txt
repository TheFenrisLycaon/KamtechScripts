7.	As the concentration increases to the critical micelle concentration(C.M.C.) soap particles abruptly collected into spherical structures called _________
a)	Ball
b)	Sphere of ions
c)	Micelles
d)	Dirt particle
c
8.	_________ is the movement of charged surfaces with corresponding ions and H2O in the stationary liquid induced by an external field.
a)	Colloidal suspension
b)	Emulsion
c)	Sedimentation potential
d)	Electrophoresis
d
Explanation It’s a technique utilized in laboratories in order to separate macro molecules based on size. The technique applies a (–ve) charge so proteins move towards a (+ve).

a)	Colloidal suspension
b)	Emulsion
c)	Sedimentation potential
d)	Electrophoresis
c
10.	_________ is the generation of an electric field by locomotion of the liquid along stationary charged surfaces.
a)	Colloidal suspension
b)	Streaming potential
c)	Sedimentation potential
d)	Electrophoresis
b
