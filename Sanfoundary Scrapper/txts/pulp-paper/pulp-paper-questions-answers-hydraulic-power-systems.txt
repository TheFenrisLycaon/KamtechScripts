a)	True
b)	False
a
2.	The liquid must flow to cause motion, its velocity is usually sufficiently high so as to have only a ___________ kinetic energy component relative to the overall work accomplished.
a)	Big
b)	Small
c)	Zero
d)	Not valid
b
3.	Some common systems that utilise hydraulics are hand operated hydraulic jacks and presses, power steering and brakes on many vehicles, backhoes, and hitch controls of agricultural tractors.
a)	True
b)	False

5.	It takes many operations of the hand pump to lift the object a suitable distance. A ___________ valve allows flow in one direction only so that several operations of the handle might be combined to lift the load.
a)	Gate
b)	Needle
c)	Check
d)	Throttle
