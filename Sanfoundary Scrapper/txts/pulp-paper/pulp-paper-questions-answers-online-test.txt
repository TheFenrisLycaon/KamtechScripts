1.	It is very important to collect useful data before trying to analyze it by charting and statistical analysis.
a)	True
b)	False
a
2.	The more _________ in a material, the more often it should be sampled. Wood has a very large amount of _________ due to the nature of the material.
a)	Durability
b)	Consistency
c)	Variability
d)	Lignin
c
3.	The accuracy of data is paramount. No amount of statistical analysis will detect errors in pulp _________ numbers that are all very less because a buret could not be filled to the top.
a)	Kappa
b)	Beta
c)	Gamma
d)	Alfa
a
4.	Data for _________ process control can be presented in whichever form in which data is commonly presented for analysis, presentations, and comparison. These tools include bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots to relate two or more variables, Pareto charts, and control charts.
a)	Statistical
b)	Consistency
c)	Variability
d)	Lignin
c
5.	 It is possible to see subtle trends in data presented tabularly, but they become more apparent when presented graphically with the respected function values.
a)	True
b)	False
a
6.	By graphing the data, the trend analysis becomes much easier. They become more apparent when presented graphically.
a)	Lorenz
b)	Quasi-static
c)	Pressure sensitive
d)	Kurtis
a
7.	The _________ is a line graph where the x-axis is the independent variable and the y-axis is the process control parameter or variable. The kappa number of pulp going to the bleach plant.
a)	Control chart
b)	Pareto charts
c)	Student’s
d)	SPC
a
8.	Upper and lower boundaries of the “desired” values of y are plotted as lines. These are the _________ and _________ The average value (X, said as “X-bar”) is centred b/w the control limits. The range of the control limits, R, depends on the statistical variation of the process.
a)	Higher limit  and lower limit
b)	Upper control limit and lower control limit
c)	Max. limit and Min. Limit
d)	Upper point and lower point
b
9.	One can quickly see if the process control variable is within the control area. If the actual y values are consistently within the boundaries, the process is said to be in control. This allows an operator to make changes when appropriate, but not to try to make changes when no action is called for. What is the topic of discussion?
a)	Control chart
b)	Pareto charts
c)	Student’s
d)	SPC
a
10.	If this does not solve the problem then new S.P.C. techniques that are being introduced in the pulp mill would probably decrement process variability of the pulp going to the bleach plant from the pulp mill. What is the topic of discussion?
a)	Control chart
b)	Pareto charts
c)	Student’s
d)	SPC
