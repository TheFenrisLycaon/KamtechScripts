1.	Pulp consists of 2 things which are, wood and the libocellulosic materials that are broken down physically and chemically.
a)	True
b)	False
a
2.	Which are 4 broad categories of pupling processes?
a)	Chemical, semi-chemical, chemi-mechanical, and mechanical
b)	Qualitative , semi-chemical, chemi-mechanical, and mechanical
c)	Quantitative, semi-chemical, chemi-mechanical, and thermal
d)	Isentropic, semi-chemical, chemi-mechanical, and mechanical
a
Chemical, semi-chemical, chemi-mechanical, and mechanical.
These are in increasing order of mechanical energy required to separate fibers and decreasing reliance on chemical action.
