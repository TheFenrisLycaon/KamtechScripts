1.	The concentration of chemicals in sulfite pulping are noted on an SO2 basis.
a)	True
b)	False
a
2.	All chemical sulfite methods use nearly 80% chemical (SO2 basis) on a dry wood basis.
a)	True
b)	False
b
3.	The various salts of _________ acid are of central importance to the various sulfite-based processes. The chemistry of _________ acid as   a function of pH is very important.
a)	Hydrochloric
b)	Hydrogen fluoride
c)	Hydrogen bromide
d)	Sulphurous
d
4.	The _________ equation could not be utilized for this part of the titration curve since the H2CO3 ionizes appreciably, thereby reducing the conc. of  H2CO3 and changing the ratio of acid to conjugate base significantly.
a)	Kennedy
b)	Henderson-Hasselbalch
c)	Jhonty-Miller
d)	Kraft-Hammer
b
5.	_________ is a moderately strong acid. It’ll react completely with any of the 5 common hydroxides utilized in sulfite cooking.
a)	Sulphurous acid
b)	Hydrochloric acid
c)	Sulphuric acid
d)	Nitric acid
a
6.	Derive the gravimetric factor for converting Ca(HSO3)2 to SO2.
a)	0.634g SO2
b)	1.254g SO2
c)	9.325g SO2
d)	40.456g SO2
a
Therefore
1g Ca(HSO3)2 x (2 mol SO2) / (1 mol Ca(HSO3)2) x (1 mol Ca(HSO3)2) / (202.21g Ca(HSO3)2) x (64.06 SO2) / (1 mol SO2) = 0.634g SO2

a)	Chlorine
b)	Sulphur
c)	Sulfurous acid
d)	Calcium
c
8.	Fill in the blank.

c)	No react
d)	SO4
b
9.	What is the name of the
 MOH + MHO3andrarr; ______+H2O
a)	M2SO3
b)	MHSO3
c)	No react
d)	SO4
b
10.	The higher this ratio, the less _________ decrement is predicted when cooking to a specified kappa number
