1.	Formation is clearly dependent on fiber _________ which makes it very crucial. They used a pilot plant machine to evaluate numerous factors on fiber _________
a)	Biocides
b)	Flocculation
c)	Alum chemistry
d)	Zeta potential
b
2.	Mechanical properties of fibers were much more crucial than chemical aspects of the slurry.
a)	True
b)	False
a
3.	_________ had an important effect although the value depends on the pulp consistency; under one set of typical commercial conditions, flocculation would change by 1.2 times.
a)	Fillers
b)	Zeta potential
c)	Fiber length
d)	Flocculation
c
4.	A variety of _________ aids were tested, and anionic polyacrylamides (P.A.M.) of high molecular weight had the most pronounced effect, with 0.5 percent causing up to 65 percent decrement in flocculation.
a)	Deflocculation
b)	Flocculation
c)	Zeta potential
d)	Fillers
a

a)	True
b)	False
b
6.	_________ is the central chemical in wet end chemistry and has gained much attention. There are various papers describing the behaviour of alum during papermaking process that generally contradict with each other.
a)	Filler
b)	Alum
c)	Zeta potential
d)	Flocculation
b
7.	This role of _________ in coordination chemistry in retention has been very clear for decades to textile chemists that describe the caustic action of alum in textile dyeing-the same thing that occurs with rosin sizing.
a)	Alum
b)	Filler
c)	Zeta potential
d)	Deflocculation
a
8.	Al ions in solution form polymers by sharing _________ groups.
a)	Phenyl
b)	Hydroxide

a)	Fillers
b)	Alum
c)	Zeta potential
d)	Deflocculation
c
10.	It varies from about -50 mV to + 50 mV. Retention’s often at a max. when the charge density is near 0. This is probably where the solubility is the least. What property’s mentioned here?
a)	Deflocculation
b)	Flocculation
c)	Zeta potential
d)	Alum
c
