a)	Mass
b)	Density
c)	Volume
d)	Viscosity

6.	A sample of wet Douglas-fir wood 20 mm thick, 50 mm wide and 10 cm long weighs 90.21 g. It is then dried at 105°Celcius to constant weight and re-weighed after cooling in a desiccator. The oven-dry weight is 44.37 g. What are the MCGR, MCQD, and basic specific gravity of the wood sample?
a)	1%, 10%, and 0.333
b)	75.2%, 103.8%, and 1.555
c)	4.8%, 106.2%, and 6.254
d)	50.8%, 103.8%, and 0.444
d
 MCGR= (90.21 – 44.37) / 90.21 x 100%= 50.8%
MCOD= (90.21 – 44.37) / 44.37 x 100%= 103.3%
sp. gr.= (44.37 / 2x5x10) / 1= 0.444
7.	What is the name of the hidden part?

d)	Weight of lignin
a
8.	What is the name of the hidden part?
a)	100%-MCGR
b)	MCOD-100%
c)	100%+MCGR
d)	MCOD+100%
a
9.	What is the name of the hidden part?
MC GR = {(weight of water in wood) / (________)} x 100%
a)	Overdry weight of wood
b)	Wet weight of wood
c)	Weight of wood in sodium
d)	Weight of lignin
b
10.	What is the name of the hidden part?
MCGR = {(MCOD) / (_______)} x 100%
a)	100%-MCGR
b)	MCOD-100%
c)	100%+MCGR
d)	MCOD+100%
