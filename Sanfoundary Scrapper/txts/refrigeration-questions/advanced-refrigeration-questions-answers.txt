1. The net effect of superheating is to have ________ COP.
a) higher
b) lower
c) moderate
d) higher or lower depending on the refrigerant used
b
2. The COP of vapor compression when vapor is superheated after compression having refrigeration effect (Re) of 360 and work done (W) of 40 is?
a) 8
b) 6.7
c) 7.8
d) 9
d
COP=\(\frac{Re}{W}=\frac{360}{40}\)=9.
3. What is the mass flow rate of the refrigerant when the heat required is 100 MJ/hr, enthalpy at discharge H2 is 434.5 KJ/kg and enthalpy of liquid Hf3 in KJ/kg at point 3 in p-h diagram is 271.97?
a) 10.254 kg/hr
b) 15.56 kg/hr
c) 10.254 kg/min
d) 15.56 kg/min
c
= \frac{100×1000}{434.5 – 271.97} \) 
= 10.254 kg/min.
4. The cycle in which the evaporation starts at point 4 and continues up to point 1 where it is dry-saturated is called?
a) Theoretical VCR with dry vapor compression
b) Theoretical VCR with wet vapor compression
c) Theoretical VCR with super – heated vapor after compression
d) Theoretical VCR with super – heated vapor before compression
d
5. What is the COP of performance of the plant when the vapor is superheated 5 degree C before entering the compressor and
H1 – Enthalpy before compression = 180
H2 – Enthalpy after compression = 215

H4 – Enthalpy at the end of expansion = 55
a) 5.7
b) 4.8
c) 4.7
d) 3.5
d
6. In domestic vapor compression refrigeration, the refrigerant commonly used is?
a) Freon – 12
b) CO2
c) H2O
d) Ammonia
a
7. Superheating before compression increases the refrigeration effect.
a) True
b) False
a
