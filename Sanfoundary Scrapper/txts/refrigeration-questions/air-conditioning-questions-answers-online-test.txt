1. What is the By-pass factor for heating coil, if td1 = 19°C, td2 = 25°C and td3 = 37°C?
a) 0.75
b) 0.4
c) 0.7
d) 0.1
c
BPF = Temperature difference between coil and exit / Temperature difference between coil and entry
= td3 – td2 / td3 – td1
= 37 – 25 / 37 – 19
= 0.70588 = 0.7.
2. What is the By-pass factor for cooling coil, if td1 = 49°C, td2 = 36°C and td3 = 30°C?
a) 0.315
b) 0.31
c) 0.320
d) 0.3
a
BPF = Temperature difference between exit and coil / Temperature difference between entry and coil
= td2 – td3 / td1 – td3
= 36 – 30 / 49 – 30
= 0.315.
3. If the value of BPF for one row of the coil is one, then what is the value of BPF for 3872 similar rows?
a) 3872
b) 3871
c) 3873
d) 1
d
So, (1)3872 = 1, for any value of n, the value comes one only.
4. If the value of BPF for one row of the coil is 0.4, then what is the value of BPF for 12 similar rows?
a) 0.00000167
b) 0.0000167
c) 0.00167
d) 0.000167
b
So, (0.4)12 = 0.0000167.
5. What is the value of sensible heat given out by the coil, if U = 198 W/m2 K, Ac = 11 m2 and tm = 0°C?
a) 1
b) 0
c) 594594
d) 543636
b
So, Sensible heat = U Ac tm = 198 x 11 x (273 + 0) = 594594.
6. What is the value of BPF, if U = 1.9 W/m2 K, Ac = 1.1 m2 and ma = 0.97 kg?
a) 0.14
b) 0.12
c) 0.13
d) 0.15
b
7. What is the value of logarithmic mean temperature if td1 = 300 K, td2 = 400 K and BPF = 0.75?
a) 70°C
b) 79°C
c) 85°C
d) 75°C
d
Tm = td2 – td1 / loge [td3 – td1 / td3 – td2] 
As, BPF for the coil = [td3 – td1 / td3 – td2] 
Tm = td2 – td1 / loge [BPF] 
= 400 – 300 / ln (1/0.75) = 100 / 0.287 = 348.43 K = 75.43°C = 75°C.
8. What is the efficiency of the coil, if BPF = 0.6913?
a) 1.6913
b) 0.4467
c) 0.3087
d) 1.4467
c
9. What is the contact factor for heating coil, if td1 = 11°C, td2 = 32°C and td3 = 47°C?
a) 0.5833
b) 0.4833
c) 0.7833
d) 0.1833
a
BPF = Temperature difference between coil and exit / Temperature difference between coil and entry
= td3 – td2 / td3 – td1
= 47 – 32 / 47 – 11
= 0.4167
ηH = 1 – BPF = 1 – 0.4167 = 0.5833.
10. What is the contact factor for cooling coil, if td1 = 44°C, td2 = 26°C and td3 = 19°C?
a) 0.62
b) 0.72
c) 0.78
d) 0.18
b
BPF = Temperature difference between coil and exit / Temperature difference between coil and entry
= td2 – td3 / td1 – td3
= 26 – 19 / 44 – 19
= 0.28
ηC = 1 – BPF = 1 – 0.28 = 0.72.
11. For given conditions, td1 = 288 K, td2 = 301 K and td3 = 314 K, the value of by-pass factor and contact factor is equal.
a) True
b) False
a
So, for given set of values the value of contact factor and by-pass factor is equal.
12. Higher the value of contact factor, poor is the performance of the coil.
a) True
b) False
b
