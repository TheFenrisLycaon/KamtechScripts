1. What is the By-pass factor for heating coil, if td1 = temperature at entry, td2 = temperature at exit and td3 = coil temperature?
a) td3 – td1 / td3 – td1
b) td3 – td2 / td3 – td1
c) td3 – td2 / td2 – td1
d) td3 – td2 / td1 – td2
b
BPF = Temperature difference between coil and exit / Temperature difference between coil and entry
= td3 – td2 / td3 – td1.
2. What is the By-pass factor for cooling coil, if td1 = temperature at entry, td2 = temperature at exit and td3 = coil temperature?
a) td3 – td1 / td3 – td1
b) td3 – td2 / td3 – td1
c) td3 – td2 / td2 – td1
d) td2 – td3 / td1 – td3
d
BPF = Temperature difference between exit and coil / Temperature difference between entry and coil
= td2 – td3 / td1 – td3.
3. If the value of BPF for one row of a coil is y then what is the value of BPF for n similar rows?
a) n / y
b) n + y
c) (y)n
d) n x y
c
4. What is the value of sensible heat given out by the coil?
a) U Ac tm
b) U Ac
c) U tm
d) U Ac2 tm
a
So, Sensible heat = U Ac tm.
5. What is the formula of logarithmic mean temperature in terms of By-pass factor?
a) Tm = td2 – td1 / loge [1/BPF] 
b) Tm = td2 – td1 / log10 [BPF] 
c) Tm = td2 – td1 / loge [BPF] 
d) Tm = td2 – td3 / loge [BPF] 
c
Tm = td2 – td1 / loge [td3 – td1 / td3 – td2] 
As, BPF for the coil = [td3 – td1 / td3 – td2] 
Tm = td2 – td1 / loge [BPF].

6. What is the efficiency of the coil?
a) 1 + BPF
b) 1 / BPF
c) BPF
d) 1 – BPF
d
7. What is the contact factor for heating coil, if td1 = temperature at entry, t2 = temperature at exit and td3 = coil temperature?
a) td3 – td1 / td3 – td1
b) td2 – td1 / td3 – td1
c) td3 – td2 / td2 – td1
d) td3 – td2 / td1 – td2
b
ηH = 1 – BPF
= 1 – [td3 – td2 / td3 – td1] 
= td2 – td1 / td3 – td1.
8. What is the contact factor for cooling coil, if td1 = temperature at entry, td2 = temperature at exit and td3 = coil temperature?
a) td1 – td2 / td1 – td3
b) td2 – td1 / td3 – td1
c) td3 – td2 / td2 – td1
d) td3 – td2 / td1 – td2
a
ηC = 1 – BPF
= 1 – [td2 – td3 / td1 – td3] 
= td1 – td2 / td1 – td3.
9. A coil with low BPF has better performance.
a) True
b) False
a
10. The value of BPF for the heating and the cooling coil is different under the same temperature conditions.
a) True
b) False
b
BPF for cooling coil is, BPF = td2 – td3  / td1 – td3
As the numerator and denominator are reversed in the cooling coil than the heating coil. So, the value we get for either of the coils is the same.
