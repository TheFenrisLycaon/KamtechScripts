a) Sensible cooling
b) Sensible heating
c) Humidification
d) Dehumidification
c
4. Which of the following is denoted by LH = (h1 – h2) = hfg (W1 – W2)?
a) Sensible cooling
b) Sensible heating
c) Humidification

6. The minimum temperature to which moist air can be cooled under ideal conditions in a spray washer is ___________
a) DPT of inlet air
b) Water inlet temperature
c) WBT of inlet air
d) Water outlet temperature
c
7. Which of the following process is used in winter air conditioning?
a) Humidification
b) Dehumidification
c) Heating and Humidification
d) Cooling and Dehumidification
c
8. Which of the following process is used in summer air conditioning?
a) Humidification
b) Dehumidification
c) Heating and Humidification
d) Cooling and Dehumidification
d
9. What is the value of Latent heat transfer in the process of humidification having enthalpies as 20 and 40 kJ / kg of dry air respectively?
a) 60
b) 40
c) -20
d) 20
d
So, latent heat transfer = h2 – h1 = 40 – 20 = 20 kJ/ kg of dry air.
10. What is the value of Latent heat transfer in the process of dehumidification having enthalpies as 19.45 and 13.67 kJ/ kg of dry air respectively?
a) 5.78
b) -5.78
c) 33.12
d) -33.12
a
So, latent heat transfer = h1 – h2 = 19.45 – 13.67 = 20 kJ / kg of dry air.
11. What is the value of Latent heat transfer in a process of humidification having hfg = 10 kJ / kg of dry air, W1 = 0.0071 kJ / kg of dry air and W2 = 0.0017 kJ / kg of dry air?
a) 0.054
b) 0.0054
c) 0.54
d) 5.4
a
So, latent heat transfer = hfg (W2 – W1) = 10 (0.0071 – 0.0017) = 0.054 kJ / kg of dry air.
12. During humidification process the dry bulb temperature ___________
a) increases
b) decreases
c) tends to zero
d) remains the same
d
13. Which of the following is not an indirect method of air-washer humidification?
a) Using vaporization after cooling
b) Using heated spray water
c) Using re-circulated spray water without prior heating of air
d) By pre-heating the air and then washing it with re-circulated air
a
i.Using heated spray water
ii.Using re-circulated spray water without prior heating of air
iii.By pre-heating the air and then washing it with re-circulated air.
14. During the sensible cooling process, specific humidity decreases.
a) True
