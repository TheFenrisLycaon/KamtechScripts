1. What is the alternate name for thermodynamic wet-bulb temperature?
a) Isobaric WBT
b) Isobaric Saturation Temperature
c) Adiabatic WBT
d) Adiabatic Saturation Temperature
d
2. What is the temperature at which air can be brought to saturation state adiabatically?
a) Thermodynamic WBT
b) Thermodynamic DBT
c) Thermodynamic DPT
d) DPT
a
3. Which of the following is carried out to obtain saturation state at the thermodynamic WBT?
a) Condensation
b) Evaporation
c) Compression
d) Expansion
b
4. Which of the following is the major equipment in the simplest form is used to do saturation of air?
a) Chamber
b) Vessel
c) Insulated Chamber
d) Pipe
c
5. The arrangement for extra-water to flow into the chamber from its top is called as ___________
a) chamber ingot
b) chamber gate
c) make-up gate
d) make-up water
d
6. What is the ratio of humidity ratio of entering and discharging air?
a) W2 / W1 = (hs2 – hfw) + ha2 – ha1 / (hs1 – hfw)
b) W1 / W2 = (hs1 – hfw) + ha2 – ha1 / (hs2 – hfw)
c) W1 / W2 = (hs2 – hfw) + ha2 – ha1 / (hs1 – hfw)
d) W1 / W2 = (hs2 – hfw) + ha1 – ha2 / (hs1 – hfw)
c
As, h1 = ha1 + W1 hs1 and h2 = ha2 + W2 hs2
So, by putting values we get,
W1 / W2 = (hs2 – hfw) + ha2 – ha1 / (hs1 – hfw).
7. The term (h2 – W2 hfw) is known as_________
a) sigma term
b) sigma heat
c) heat factor
d) heat term
b
8. If h1 = 32 kJ/kg, h2 = 41 kJ/kg, hfw = 49 kJ/kg, W1 = 0.0109 kg/kg of dry air and W2 = 0.0297 kg/kg of dry air then what is the value of sigma heat?
a) 41.0865
b) 39.5447
c) 38.9013
d) 45.8775
b
So, putting values in the formula,
Sigma heat = [41 – (49 x 0.0297)] = 39.5447.
9. Evaporation from water to flowing air is carried out adiabatically.
a) False
b) True
b
10. Make-up water is used to keep the water level constant.
a) True
b) False
a
