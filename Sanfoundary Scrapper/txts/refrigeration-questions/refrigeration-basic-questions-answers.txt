12. What is the ratio of m2 / m1 for the following arrangement?
If, m1 = Mass of refrigerant passing through the evaporator
m2 = Mass of refrigerant passing through condenser
a) (h1 – hf6) / (h2 – h1) – (h4 – h3)
b) (h1 – hf6) / (h2 – h1) + (h4 – h3)
c) (h8 – hf10) / (h9 – hf10)
d) (h3 – hf9) / (h4 – h8)
d
Heat taken by the flash chamber = Heat given by the flash chamber
m2 h8 + m1 h3 = m1 hf9 + m2 h4
m1 (h3 – hf9) = m2 (h4 – h8)
m2 / m1 = (h3 – hf9) / (h4 – h8).
13. What is the value of work done for the following arrangement?
If, m1 = Mass of refrigerant passing through the evaporator
m2 = Mass of refrigerant passing through the condenser
a) m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h4 – h3)
b) (h1 – hf10) / (h4 – h9)
c) (h8 – hf10) / (h9 – hf10)
d) m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h5 – h4)
d
Work = Work done by low-pressure compressor + Work done by high-pressure compressor
= mass of refrigerant flowing through the low-pressure compressor x enthalpy change + mass of refrigerant flowing through the high-pressure compressor x enthalpy change
Work done by the low-pressure compressor = m1 (h2 – h1)
Work done by the high-pressure compressor = m2 (h5 – h4)
Total work = m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h5 – h4).
14. What is the value of work done for the following arrangement?
If, m1 = Mass of refrigerant passing through the evaporator
m2 = Mass of refrigerant passing through condenser
a) m1 (h1 – hf9) / m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h5 – h4)
b) m3 (h1 – hf10) / m2 (h4 – h9)
c) m2 (h8 – hf10) / m1 (h9 – hf10)
d) m1 (h1 – h11) / m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h5 – h4)
a
Hence, by taking the help of above diagrams,
R.E. = Heat absorbed in the evaporator
= mass flowing through the evaporator x enthalpy change
= m1 (h1 – h10) as, hf9 = h10
Work = Work done by low-pressure compressor + Work done by high-pressure compressor
= mass of refrigerant flowing through the low-pressure compressor x enthalpy change + mass of refrigerant flowing through the high-pressure compressor x enthalpy change
Total Work = m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h5 – h4)
Hence, C.O.P. = m1 (h1 – hf9) / Total work
= m1 (h1 – hf9) / m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h5 – h4).
15. What is the value of Refrigeration effect if m1 = 4 kg/min, and enthalpies for the point 1, 2, 4, 5, 9 are 1350, 1550, 1480, 1620, and 280 kJ/kg. If the refrigeration effect is 4280 kJ/min and work done is 15 kW, then what is the value of C.O.P.?
a) 4.85
b) 5.50
c) 4.75
d) 6.00
c
h1 = 1350 kJ/kg
hf9 = h10 = 280 kJ/kg
h2 = 1550 kJ/kg
h4 = 1480 kJ/kg
h5 = 1620 kJ/kg
As, enthalpies of all points is given but it is a redundant data cause direct values of refrigeration effect and work is given, hence C.O.P. can be found easily.
Refrigeration effect = m1 (h1 – h11)
= 4280 kJ/min
Work = 15 kW = 900 kJ/min
C.O.P. = Refrigeration effect / Work
= 4280 / 900
= 4.75.
