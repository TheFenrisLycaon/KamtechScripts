c) High capacity water coolers
d) Industrial air conditioners
a
4. Which of the following is true about shell and coil condensers?
a) water flows in the shell and refrigerant in the coil
b) refrigerant flows in the shell and water in the coil
c) water and refrigerant flow in the coil
d) water and refrigerant flow in the shell
b
5. What is the material of tubes used for shell and tube condenser in ammonia refrigeration system?
a) Aluminum
b) Brass
c) Steel
d) Copper
c
6. What is the condensing medium used in evaporative condensers?
a) air only
b) water only
c) ammonia
d) air and water
d
7. What is the value of Heat Rejection Factor if the C.O.P. 4.28?
a) 5.28
b) -3.28
c) 1.233
d) 0.766
c
HRF = QC / RE, Where, QC = Load on the condenser & RE = Refrigeration capacity
And as we know, the load on the condenser, i.e., QC is the summation of refrigeration capacity and work done by the compressor.
QC = RE + W
Hence, HRF = QC / RE = RE + W / RE = 1 + W / RE = 1 + 1 / C.O.P. (as C.O.P. = RE / W)
HRF = 1 + 1 / 4.28 = 1.233.
8. What is the value of HRF if Work is 10 kW and refrigeration capacity is 40 kW?
a) 1.25
b) 0.25
c) 0.75
d) 1
a
HRF = QC / RE, Where, QC = Load on the condenser & RE = Refrigeration capacity
And as we know, the load on the condenser, i.e., QC is the summation of refrigeration capacity and work done by the compressor.
QC = RE + W
Hence, HRF = QC / RE = RE + W / RE = 1 + W / RE = 1 + 1 / C.O.P. (as C.O.P. = RE / W)
HRF = 1 + (10 / 40) = 1 + 0.25 = 1.25.
9. Air-cooled condensers operate on lower condensing temperatures than water-cooled condensers.
a) False
b) True
a
10. The HRF for R – 12 with condensing temperature and evaporator temperature as 40°C and 5°C respectively is 1.5.
a) True
b) False
b
