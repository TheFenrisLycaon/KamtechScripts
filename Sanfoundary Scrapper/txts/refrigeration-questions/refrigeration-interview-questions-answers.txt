2. What does 1 Tonne (TR) in refrigeration mean?
a) Weight of gases
b) Weight of coolant
c) Capacity of 1 tonne air to be cooled to 0 C in 24 hours
d) Capacity of 1 tonne water to be cooled to 0 C in 24 hours
d
3. 1 Tonne = ______ KJ/s.
a) 2.67
b) 1.087
c) 3.5
d) 232.6
c
    = \(\frac{1000 × 335}{24 × 60}\) KJ/min
    = 232.6 KJ/min = 210 KJ/min (practically taken)
    = 3.5 KJ/s.

d) 430 KJ/min
a
    = \(\frac{1000 × 335}{24 × 60}\) KJ/min
    = 232.6 KJ/min
    = 210 KJ/min (practically taken).
