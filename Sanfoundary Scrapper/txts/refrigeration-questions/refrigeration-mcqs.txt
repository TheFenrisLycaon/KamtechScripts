1. What is the use of a flash chamber in VCR system?
a) To increase pressure
b) To decrease pressure
c) To separate vapour and liquid refrigerant
d) To evaporate refrigerant partially
c
2. What is the amount of mass of vapour refrigerant flowing directly from flash chamber to suction of the compressor?
a) m1
b) m2
c) m1 + m2
d) m2 – m1
d
m2 = Mass of refrigerant (liquid and vapour) circulating through the condenser
Hence, the amount of mass flowing through the flash chamber to the compressor is given by,
= m2 – m1.
3. What is the ratio of the mass of refrigerant supplied to evaporator and mass of refrigerant circulating through condenser i.e., m1 / m2?
a) h1 – h2 / h1 – h4
b) h1 – h4 / h1 – hf4’
c) h2 – h1 / h4 – h1
d) h1 – hf4’ / h1 – h4
b
Heat taken by the flash chamber = Heat given out by the flash chamber
m2 h4 = m1 hf4’ + (m2 – m1) h1
m2 (h1 – h4) = m1 (h1 – hf4’)
m1 / m2 = [h1 – h4 / h1 – hf4’].
4. What is the use of accumulator or pre-cooler in VCR system?
a) To supply dry saturated vapour and pure liquid refrigerant to the respective equipment
b) To decrease pressure
c) To increase pressure
d) To condense refrigerant partially
a
5. What is the use of a liquid pump in the VCR system containing accumulator?
a) To maintain the circulation of the refrigerant
b) To provide liquid refrigerant
c) To expand the liquid refrigerant
d) To pre-evaporate the liquid refrigerant
a
6. What is the ratio of the mass of refrigerant supplied to evaporator and mass of refrigerant circulating through condenser i.e., m1 / m2?
a) h1 − h2 / h1 − h4
b) h1 − h4 / h1’ − hf4’
c) h2 − h1 / h4 − h1
d) h1’ − hf4’ / h1 − h4
b
Heat taken by the accumulator = Heat given out by the accumulator
m2 h4 + m1 h1’ = m2 h1 + m1 hf4’
m1 (h1’ − hf4’) = m2 (h1 − h4)
m1 / m2 = [h1 − h4 / h1’ − hf4’].
7. What is the use of heat exchanger in the following schematic?
a) Compression
b) Expansion
c) Subcooling of liquid by vapour refrigerant
d) Subcooling of vapour by liquid refrigerant
c
8. What is the ratio of the mass of the vapour refrigerant and mass of the liquid refrigerant i.e., m1 / m2?
a) 1
b) h1 − h4 / h1’ − hf4’
c) 0
d) h1’ − hf4’ / h1 − h4
a
m1 = m2 or m1 / m2 = 1.
9. What is the use of heat exchanger in the following schematic?
a) Compression
b) Subcooling of liquid by liquid refrigerant
c) Subcooling of liquid by vapour refrigerant
d) Subcooling of vapour by liquid refrigerant
b
10. What is the amount of mass of refrigerator leaving the evaporator?
a) m2 − m1
b) m1 − m3
c) m2 + m3
d) m2 − m3
d
m2 = Mass of liquid refrigerant passing through the condenser
m3 = Mass of liquid refrigerant supplied to the heat exchanger from the expansion valve
By taking the help of schematic,
Mass of refrigerator leaving the evaporator, m1 = m2 − m3.
11. What is the ratio of the mass of liquid refrigerant passing through the condenser and mass of liquid refrigerant supplied to the heat exchanger i.e., m3 / m2?
a) h1 − h2 / h1 − h4
b) h1 − h4 / h1’ − hf4’
c) hf3 − hf3’ / h1 − hf4’
d) h1 − hf4’ / hf3 − hf3’
c
Heat lost by liquid refrigerant from condenser = Heat gained by liquid refrigerant from expansion valve
m2 hf3 + m3 hf4’ = m3 h1 + m2 hf3’
m2 (hf3 − hf3’) = m3 (h1 − hf4’)
m3 / m2 = [hf3 − hf3’ / h1 − hf4’].
