6. What is the relation between m1, m2, and m3?
If m1 = mass of refrigerant passing through the evaporator
m2 = mass of refrigerant passing through the condenser
m3 = mass of liquid evaporated in the intercooler
a) m3 = m1 + m2
b) m3 = m1 – m2
c) m3 = m2 – m1
d) m3 = m1 / m2
c
Hence, m3 = m2 – m1.
7. What is the ratio of the mass of refrigerant flowing through condenser and mass of refrigerant flowing through the evaporator, i.e., m2 / m1?
If m1 = mass of refrigerant passing through the evaporator
m2 = mass of refrigerant passing through the condenser
a) h2 – h6 / h3 – hf5
b) h1 – h6 / h1 – hf5
c) h2 – h3 / h1 – hf5
d) h2 – h4 / h1 – hf5
a
The heat taken by the liquid intercooler = Heat given by the liquid intercooler
m2 hf5 + m1 h2 = m1 h6 + m2 h3
m2 (h3 – hf5) = m1 (h2 – h6)
m2 / m1 = h2 – h6 / h3 – hf5.
8. What is the value of C.O.P. for the following arrangement?
a) m1 (h1 – hf5) / m1 (h2 – h1) – m2 (h4 – h3)
b) m1 (h1 – hf5) / m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h4 – h3)
c) m1 (h1 – hf5) / m1 (h2 – h1)
d) m1 (h1 – hf5) / m2 (h4 – h3)
b
Hence, by taking the help of above diagrams,
R.E. = Heat absorbed in the evaporator
= mass flowing through the evaporator x enthalpy change
= m1 (h1 – hf5) as, hf5 = h6
Work = Work done by low-pressure compressor + Work done by high-pressure compressor
= mass of refrigerant flowing through the low-pressure compressor x enthalpy change + mass of refrigerant flowing through the high-pressure compressor x enthalpy change
Work = m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h4 – h3)
Hence, C.O.P. = m1 (h1 – hf5) / m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h4 – h3).
9. Why is such a type of arrangement used in ammonia plants?
a) High latent heat of vaporization
b) Low latent heat of vaporization
c) Medium latent heat of vaporization
d) High toxicity
