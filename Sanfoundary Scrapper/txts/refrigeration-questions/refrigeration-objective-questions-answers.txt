1. What is the work done during an isothermal compression?
a) 2.3 mRT1 ln (p2 / p1)
b) 2.3 mRP1 ln (p2 / p1)
c) 2.3 mRT1 ln (p1 / p2)
d) mRT1 ln (p2 / p1)
d
Work done = mRT1 ln (p2 / p1) or 2.3 mRT1 log (p2 / p1).
2. What is the work done during a polytropic compression?
a) [n / (n – 1)] mR (T2 – T1)
b) [n / (n + 1)] mR (T2 – T1)
c) [n / (n – 1)] mR (T2 + T1)
d) [n / (n + 1)] mR (T2 + T1)
a
Work done = [n / (n – 1)] mR (T2 – T1).
3. What is the work done during an isentropic compression?
a) [n / (n – 1)] mR (T2 – T1)
b) [n / (n + 1)] mR (T2 – T1)
c) [n / (n – 1)] mR (T2 + T1)
d) [n / (n + 1)] mR (T2 + T1)
a
Work done = [n / (n – 1)] mR (T2 – T1).
4. What is the expression for optimum intercooler or intermediate pressure P2 if the cooling ratio is fixed in a compound compression refrigeration system with intercooling?
a) P2 = P1 / P3
b) P2 = P3 / P1
c) P2 = √P1 x P3
d) P2 = ∛P1 x P3
c
T1 P2k – 1 / P1k = T3 P3k / P2k + 1
For the given conditions T1 = T3,
P2 x P2 = P1 x P3
P2 = √P1 x P3.
5. Where is the centrifugal compressor mostly suitable?
a) Small displacements and low condensing pressures
b) Small displacements and high condensing pressures
c) Large displacements and low condensing pressures
d) Large displacements and high condensing pressures
c

6. Where is the reciprocating compressor mostly suitable?
a) Small displacements and low condensing pressures
b) Small displacements and high condensing pressures
c) Large displacements and low condensing pressures
d) Large displacements and high condensing pressures
b
7. What is the value of swept volume?
If, D = 10 mm
L = 6 mm
a) 188.49
b) 94.2477
c) 47.1238
d) 471.23
d
Here, D is diameter so for a circle with diameter D area = π D2 / 4
So, swept volume = π D2 / 4 x L = π D2 L / 4 = π x 10 x 10 x 6 / 4 = 471.23.
8. What is the value of the clearance factor?
If, VC = 0.137 and VP = 0.034
a) 0.00465
b) 0.0465
c) 4.029
d) 0.2481
c
Clearance factor = VC / VP = 0.137 / 0.034 = 4.029.
9. What is the value of volumetric efficiency?
VC = 0.445, VS = 0.843 and VP = 1.087
a) 1.289
b) 0.5278
c) 1.894
d) 0.775
d
VS / VP = 0.843 / 1.087 = 0.775 = 77.5 %.
10. The main disadvantage of centrifugal compressors is surging.
a) False
b) True
b
