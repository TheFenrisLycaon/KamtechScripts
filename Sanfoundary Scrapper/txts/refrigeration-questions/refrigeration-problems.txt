1. What type of VCR is shown in the T – s diagram?
a) Theoretical VCR with sub-cooling or under cooling
b) Theoretical VCR with wet before compression
c) Theoretical VCR with wet after compression
d) Theoretical VCR with dry compression
a
2. The ultimate effect of undercooling is to increase the value of COP under same set of conditions.
a) True
b) False
a
3. What is the COP of a theoretical VCR having an undercooling of 5° C. Use the following data.
Enthalpy H1 = 180.5,
Enthalpy H2 = 194.5,
Enthalpy Hf3′ = 45.5,
Specific heat at constant pressure for superheated liquid = 0.95KJ/kg K.
a) 12.332
b) 9.982
c) 8.973
d) 9.879
b
Hf3 = Hf3′ – cpl × degree of undercooling
Hf3 = 45.5 – 0.95 × 5
= 40.75
COP = \(\frac{H_1 – H_{f3}}{H_2 – H_1} = \frac{180.5 – 40.75}{194.5- 180.5}\) = 9.982.
4. The process of under cooling the refrigerant below the saturation temperature happens after?
a) Compression
b) Before condensation
c) Evaporation
d) Before throttling
d

5. The process of under cooling can only be brought about by circulating more quantity of cooling water through the condenser or by using water colder than the main circulating water.
a) True
b) False
b
6. What effect does the under cooling process have on piston displacement of the compressor?
a) Increases
b) Reduces
c) No effect
d) Can’t say from the given data
b
7. The effect of liquid sub cooling is less pronounced in case of?
a) Water
b) CO2
c) NH3
d) Effect is same for all the liquids
c
8. The difference between the saturation temperature T3 of liquid refrigerant at pressure p3 = p2 and the actual temperature of liquid refrigerant T3′ is called?
a) Degree of freedom
b) Degree of subcooling
c) Degree of superheating
d) Degree of condensation
b
