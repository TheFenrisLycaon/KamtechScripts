1. What is the key difference between a simple VAR and Electrolux refrigerator?
a) Absorber
b) Liquid pump
c) Working mechanism
d) Generator
b
2. What is the other name for Electrolux refrigerator?
a) Single-fluid absorption system
b) Two-fluid absorption system
c) Three-fluid absorption system
d) Four-fluid absorption system
c
3. Which of the following is valid for one of the processes in the Electrolux refrigerator?
a) Ammonia evaporates in hydrogen
b) Hydrogen evaporates in ammonia
c) Water evaporates in hydrogen
d) Ammonia evaporates in water
a
4. What are the fluids used in the Electrolux refrigerator?
a) Hydrogen, Water
b) Hydrogen, Water, Lithium
c) Hydrogen, Water, Bromide
d) Hydrogen, Water, Ammonia
d
5. What is the purpose of using Hydrogen in Electrolux refrigerator?
a) To increase the vapour pressure of ammonia
b) To increase the rate of evaporation
c) To decrease the rate of evaporation
d) To get evaporated by using ammonia
b
6. What is the role of water in the Electrolux refrigerator?
a) Solvent
b) Evaporation rate enhancer
c) Evaporation rate reducer
d) Refrigerant
a
7. What is the value of C.O.P. in the Electrolux refrigerator?
a) QG / QE
b) QE / QG
c) QG / QC
d) QC / QE
b
So, C.O.P. = Refrigeration effect / Total work done
= Heat absorbed in the evaporator / Work done by pump + Heat supplied in the generator
QE = Heat absorbed in the evaporator and QG = Heat supplied in the generator
C.O.P. = QE / QG
8. Which refrigerants are used in Electrolux and Li-Br water refrigeration system?
a) Ammonia and Lithium
b) Water and Water
c) Water and Bromide
d) Ammonia and Water
d
9. In Li-Br water system, Water is used as an absorber and Li-Br solution as a refrigerant.
a) False
b) True
a
10. Which of the following nature of Li-Br solution leads to the usage of inhibitors?
a) Toxic
b) Corrosive
c) Strong affinity for water vapour
d) Low boiling point
b
