1. Multiple refrigerants can be used in the cascade refrigeration system.
a) True
b) False
a
2. How is the cascade system achieved?
a) VCR system in a parallel combination
b) VAR system in a series combination
c) VAR system in a parallel combination
d) VCR system in a series combination
d
3. Cascade refrigeration system reduces the C.O.P.
a) True
b) False
b
4. What is the value of m1 in the following diagram?
a) 210 Q / (h1 – h7) kg/min
b) 210 Q / (h1 – h4) kg/s
c) 210 Q / (h1 – h4) kg/min
d) 210 Q / (h1 – h7) kg/s
c
Hence, R.E. = m x delta h
210 Q = m1 x (h1 – h4)
m1 = 210 Q / (h1 – h1) kg/min.
5. What is the value of m2 / m1 in the following diagram?
a) (h2 – h4) / (h5 – h8)
b) (h6 – h4) / (h7 – h8)
c) (h1 – h4) / (h6 – h8)
d) (h2 – h1) / (h1 – h8)
a
Heat absorbed in the high temperature cascade system = Heat rejected in the low temperature cascade system
m2 h5 + m1 h4 = m1 h2 + m2 h8
m1 (h2 – h4) = m2 (h5 – h8)
m2 / m1 = (h2 – h4) / (h5 – h8).
6. What is the value of work done in the following diagram?
a) m1 (h2 – h4) + m2 (h5 – h6)
b) m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h6 – h5)
c) m1 (h2 – h8) + m2 (h5 – h8)
d) m1 (h2 – h5) + m2 (h4 – h8)
b
Work = mass of refrigerant flowing through the compressor x change of enthalpy
Work done by low-temperature cascade system = m1 (h2 – h1)
Work done by high-temperature cascade system = m2 (h6 – h5)
Total work = Work done by low-temperature cascade system + Work done by high-temperature cascade system
Total work done = m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h6 – h5).
7. What is the value of C.O.P. in the following diagram?
a) 210 Q / m1 (h2 – h4) + m2 (h5 – h6)
b) 210 Q / m1 (h2 – h7) + m2 (h6 – h8)
c) 210 Q / m1 (h2 – h8) + m2 (h5 – h8)
d) 210 Q / m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h6 – h5)
d
Hence, R.E. = m x delta h
= 210 Q where, Q is the load on the low-temperature cascade system in tones of refrigeration
Work = mass of refrigerant flowing through the compressor x change of enthalpy
Work done by low-temperature cascade system = m1 (h2 – h1)
Work done by high-temperature cascade system = m2 (h6 – h5)
Total work = Work done by low-temperature cascade system + Work done by high-temperature cascade system
Total work done = m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h6 – h5)
As, C.O.P. = Refrigeration effect / Total work done
= 210 Q / m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h6 – h5).
8. What is the value of power required to drive the systems in the following diagram?
a) m1 (h2 – h4) + m2 (h5 – h6) kW
b) m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h8 – h1) kJ/s
c) m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h6 – h5) kW
d) m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h6 – h5) kJ/min
c
Work = mass of refrigerant flowing through the compressor x change of enthalpy
Work done by low-temperature cascade system = m1 (h2 – h1)
Work done by high-temperature cascade system = m2 (h6 – h5)
Total work = Work done by low-temperature cascade system + Work done by high-temperature cascade system
Total work done = m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h6 – h5) kJ/min
Power required = Work done / 60
= m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h6 – h5) kW.
9. What is the value of C.O.P. of low-temperature cascade system in terms of intermediate temperature in the following diagram?
If TEL and TCL = Evaporator and condenser temperatures for low-temperature cascade system
TEH and TCH = Evaporator and condenser temperatures for high-temperature cascade system
a) TEL / TCL – TCL
b) TCL / TCL – TEL
c) TCL / TI – TCL
d) TEL / TI – TCL
d
C.O.P. = Temperature of the evaporator / Temperature of the condenser – Temperature of the evaporator
= TEL / TCL – TEL
As, when low-temperature cascade condenser temperature is equal to high-temperature cascade evaporator temperature.
TCL = TEH = TI
Hence, C.O.P. = TEL / TI – TCL.
10. What is the value of C.O.P. of high-temperature cascade system in terms of intermediate temperature in the following diagram?
If TEL and TCL = Evaporator and condenser temperatures for low-temperature cascade system
TEH and TCH = Evaporator and condenser temperatures for high-temperature cascade system
a) TEH / TCH – TCH
b) TI / TCH – TI
c) TCH / TI – TCH
d) TEH / TI – TCH
b
C.O.P. = Temperature of the evaporator / Temperature of the condenser – Temperature of the evaporator
= TEH / TCH – TEH
As, when low-temperature cascade condenser temperature is equal to high-temperature cascade evaporator temperature.
TCL = TEH = TI
Hence, C.O.P. = TI / TCH – TI.
11. What is the value of pressure ratio if the pressure at point 1 and 2 is 1.809 and 3.467 bar, respectively?
a) 1.916
b) 1.916 bar
c) 0.521
d) 0.521 bar
a
So, pressure ratio = P2 / P1
= 3.467 / 1.809
= 1.916.
Pressure ratio is the ratio of two same quantities, so this value does not have any unit.
