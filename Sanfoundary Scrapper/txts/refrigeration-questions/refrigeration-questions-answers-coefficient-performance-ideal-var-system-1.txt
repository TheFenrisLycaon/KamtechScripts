1. What is the formula for COP of an ideal vapour absorption refrigeration system?
Qg = the heat given to the refrigerant in the generator
Qe= the heat absorbed by the refrigerant in the evaporator
a) \(\frac{Q_e}{Q_g}\) 
b) \(\frac{Q_g}{Q_e}\) 
c) Qg × Qe
d) Qg – Qe
a
COP = \(\frac{Q_e}{Q_g}\).
2. An ideal vapour absorption refrigeration system may be regarded as a combination of _________
a) Carnot engine and Carnot pump
b) Carnot refrigerant and Carnot pump
c) Carnot engine and Carnot refrigerant
d) Carnot engine alone
c
COP = \(\frac{Q_e}{Q_g}\).
3. Find the COP of a vapour absorption refrigeration system using the following data.
Qg = 6600
Qe = 2100
a) 0.45
b) 0.65
c) 0.31
d) 0.35
c
COP = \(\frac{Q_e}{Q_g}\) 
COP = \(\frac{2100}{6600}\) = 0.31.
4. Find the COP of a vapour absorption refrigeration system using the following data.
Te = 268
Tg = 393.2
Tc = 303
a) 1.53
b) 1.76
c) 1.66
d) 1.98
b
COP = \(\frac{Q_e}{Q_g}\) 
= \(\frac{T_e}{T_c – T_e} × \frac{T_g-T_c}{T_g}\) 
= \((\frac{268}{303-268})*(\frac{393.2-303}{393.2})\) 
= 1.76.
5. The expression \(\frac{T_e}{T_c – T_e}\) in the formula for COP i.e. \(\frac{T_e}{T_c – T_e} × \frac{T_g-T_c}{T_g}\) refers to __________
Te and Tc are the temperature limits for Carnot refrigerator
Tg and Tc are the temperature limits for Carnot engine
a) COP of Carnot engine
b) COP of Carnot refrigerator
c) COP of Carnot pump
d) COP of Bell-Coleman cycle
b
6. In case the heat is discharged at different temperatures in condenser and absorber then the formula for COP would be?
Ta = Temperature at which heat is discharged in the absorber
Te and Tc are the temperature limits for Carnot refrigerator
Tg and Tc are the temperature limits for Carnot engine
a) COP = \(\frac{T_e}{T_c – T_e} × \frac{T_g-T_c}{T_g}\) 
b) COP = \(\frac{T_e}{T_c – T_e} × \frac{T_g-T_c}{T_g} × T_a\) 
c) COP = \(\frac{T_e}{T_c – T_e} × \frac{T_g-T_c}{T_g} ± T_a\) 
d) COP = \(\frac{T_e}{T_c – T_e} × \frac{T_g-T_c}{T_g}\) 
d
COP = \(\frac{T_e}{T_c – T_e} × \frac{T_g-T_a}{T_g}\).
7. Find the COP of an ideal vapour absorption refrigeration system using the following data.
Qg = 1880
Qe = 1045
a) 0.47
b) 0.65
c) 0.69
d) 0.55
d
COP = \(\frac{Q_e}{Q_g}\) 
COP = \(\frac{1045}{1880}\) = 0.555.
