1. What is the term C.O.P. referred in terms of refrigeration?
a) Capacity of Performance
b) Co-efficient of Plant

c
2. C.O.P. can be expressed by which equation?

b) \(\frac{Refrigeration \,effect}{Work \,Done}\) 
c) \(\frac{Work\, Done}{Heat \,Transfer}\) 
d) \(\frac{Heat \,Transfer}{Work \,Done}\) 
b
Whereas the ratio- Work done to Heat transfer is called the efficiency.
3. What is the term relative C.O.P. referred in terms of refrigeration?
a) \(\frac{Actual \,C.O.P.}{Theoretical \,C.O.P.}\) 
b) \(\frac{Theoretical \,C.O.P.}{Actual \,C.O.P.}\) 
c) \(\frac{Actual \,C.O.P.}{Average \,C.O.P.}\) 
d) \(\frac{Average \,C.O.P.}{Theoretical \,C.O.P.}\) 
a
4. Find the C.O.P. of a refrigeration system if the work input is 40 KJ/kg and refrigeration effect produced is 130 KJ/kg of refrigerant flowing.
a) 3.00
b) 2.25
c) 3.75
d) 3.25
d
C.O.P. = \(\frac{Refrigeration \,effect}{Work \,Done}\) 
       = \(\frac{130}{40}\) 
       = 3.25 (unit less).
5. Find the Relative C.O.P. of a refrigeration system if the work input is 60 KJ/kg and refrigeration effect produced is 130 KJ/kg of refrigerant flowing. Also Theoretical C.O.P. is 3.
a) 0.65
b) 0.79
c) 0.72
d) 0.89
c
Actual C.O.P. = \(\frac{Refrigeration \,effect}{Work \,Done}\) 
= \(\frac{130}{60}\) 
                          = 2.167 (unit less)
Relative C.O.P. = \(\frac{Actual \,C.O.P.}{Theoretical \,C.O.P.}\) 
	        = 2.167/3 = 0.722 i.e. = 72.2 %.

6. Find the C.O.P. of a refrigeration system if the work input is 30 KJ/kg and refrigeration effect produced is 120 KJ/kg of refrigerant flowing.
a) 3.00
b) 4.00
c) 0.75
d) 0.25
b
C.O.P. = \(\frac{Refrigeration \,effect}{Work \,Done}\) 
= \(\frac{120}{30}\) 
              = 4 (unit less).
7. Which equation represents efficiency in general?
a) \(\frac{Work \,Done}{Refrigeration \,effect}\) 
b) \(\frac{Heat \,Trasfer}{Work \,Done}\) 
c) \(\frac{Work\, Done}{Heat \,Transfer}\) 
d) \(\frac{Refrigeration \,effect}{Work \,Done}\) 
c
Whereas Co-efficient of Performance is the ratio of Refrigeration effect produced to the work done or work supplied to produce the effect.
8. The Co-efficient of Performance is always __________
a) greater than 1
b) less than 1
c) equal to 1
d) zero
a
9. In a refrigerating machine, if the lower temperature is fixed, then the C.O.P. of machine can be increased by?
a) Increasing the higher temperature
b) Decreasing the higher temperature
c) Operating the machine at lower speed
d) Operating the machine at higher speed
b
10. The reverse Carnot cycle C.O.P. can be expressed as _________ (Where t1 is the lower temperature and t2 is the higher temperature).
a) \(\frac{t1-t2}{t2}\) 
b) \(\frac{t2-t1}{t2}\) 
c) \(\frac{t2-t1}{t1-t2}\) 
d) \(\frac{t2-t1}{t1}\) 
d
11. If a condenser and evaporator temperatures are 120 K and 60 K respectively, then reverse Carnot C.O.P is _________
a) 0.5
b) 1
c) 3
d) 2
b
	              = \(\frac{120-60}{60}\) 
	              = 1.
12. The C.O.P. of reverse Carnot cycle is most strongly dependent on which of the following?
a) Evaporator temperature
b) Condenser temperature
c) Specific heat
d) Refrigerant
a
13. If a condenser and evaporator temperatures are 312 K and 273 K respectively, then reverse Carnot C.O.P is _________
a) 5
b) 6
c) 7
d) 8
c
		      = \(\frac{312-271}{273}\) 
	              = 7.
14. The C.O.P for reverse Carnot refrigerator is 2. The ratio of lowest temperature to highest temperature will be _____
a) twice
b) half
c) four times
d) three times
d
	            2  = \(\frac{X-Y}{Y}\) 
	            2  = \(\frac{X}{Y}\) – 1
  Thus, \(\frac{X}{Y}\) = 3 i.e. X=3Y i.e. Higher temperature = 3 times Lower temperature.
15. If a condenser and evaporator temperatures are 250 K and 100 K respectively, then reverse Carnot C.O.P is _________
a) 5.5
b) 1.5
c) 2.5
d) 3.0
c
	              = \(\frac{250-100}{100}\) 
                      =  2.5.
