1. What is the purpose of using a condenser?
a) To absorb heat
b) To reject heat
c) To convert liquid refrigerant to vapor refrigerant
d) To convert solid refrigerant to vapor refrigerant
b
2. Which of the following is not the criterion for the selection of the condenser?
a) The capacity of the condenser
b) Type of refrigerant used
c) Type of cooling medium available
d) Type of compressor and evaporator used
d
3. What is the expression for the load on the condenser?
a) QC = RE + W
b) QC = RE – W
c) QC = RE x W
d) QC = RE / W
a
QC = RE + W
Where, QC = Load on the condenser, RE = Refrigeration capacity & W = Work done by the compressor.
4. What is the expression for the heat rejection factor?
a) HRF = W / RE
b) HRF = RE / W
c) HRF = QC / RE
d) HRF = RE / QC
c
HRF = QC / RE, Where, QC = Load on the condenser & RE = Refrigeration capacity.
5. What is the expression for the heat rejection factor in terms of C.O.P.?
a) 1 + C.O.P.
b) 1 – C.O.P.
c) 1 – 1 / C.O.P.
d) 1 + 1 / C.O.P.
d
HRF = QC / RE, Where, QC = Load on the condenser & RE = Refrigeration capacity
And as we know, the load on the condenser, i.e., QC is the summation of refrigeration capacity and work done by the compressor.
QC = RE + W
Hence, HRF = QC / RE = RE + W / RE = 1 + W / RE = 1 + 1 / C.O.P. (as C.O.P. = RE / W).
6. Which of the following does not affect the refrigeration capacity of the condenser?
a) Material
b) Amount of contact
c) Temperature difference
d) Type of refrigerant
d
7. Materials form deposits inside the condenser water tubes is called _______
a) water rusting
b) water corrosion
c) water fouling
d) water failing
c
8. Which of the following is not the effect of water fouling?
a) Increase in heat transfer rate
b) Tube insulation
c) Reduction in heat transfer rate
d) Restrict water flow
a
9. What is the fouling factor?
a) Heat transfer coefficient
b) 1 / Heat transfer coefficient
c) \(\sqrt{Heat \,transfer \,coefficient}\) 
d) 1 / (Heat transfer coefficient)2
b
10. The initial cost of the air-cooled condenser is high.
a) False
b) True
a
