1. Which of the following cooling towers possess maximum heat transfer from air to water?
a) Natural Draft
b) Mechanical Draft
c) Natural and Mechanical Draft
d) Atmospheric Draft
b
2. How is the performance of the cooling tower indicated?
a) Wet-bulb temperature
b) Dry bulb temperature
c) Approach
d) Range
c
3. What is the difference between the temperature of entering and leaving water in the cooling tower?
a) Wet-bulb temperature
b) Dry bulb temperature
c) Approach
d) Range
d
4. What is the formula for the effectiveness of cooling tower from the following?
a) Range / (Range + Approach)
b) Approach / (Range + Approach)
c) Range / Approach
d) Approach / Range
a
Hence, the effectiveness can be given as,
Effectiveness = Range / (Range + Approach).
5. A cooling tower brings water temperature to _________

6. What is the correct representation of range from the following?
a) Range = Cooling tower water outlet temperature – Wet bulb temperature
b) Range = Cooling tower water inlet temperature – Wet bulb temperature
c) Range = Cooling tower water outlet temperature – Dry bulb temperature
d) Range = Heat load in kcal per hour / Water circulation in liters per hour
d
Range = Heat load in kcal per hour / Water circulation in liters per hour
Range = Cooling tower water inlet temperature – Cooling tower water outlet temperature.
7. What is L / G in terms of the cooling tower?
a) Length / Girth
b) Length / Gradient
c) Air mass flow rate / Water flow rate
d) Water flow rate / Air mass flow rate
d
8. Mechanical draft cooling tower size is ________ the size of the natural draft cooling tower.
a) smaller than
b) larger than
c) equal to the
d) very much larger than
a
9. The cooling capacity of mechanical draft cooling towers cannot be varied.
a) False
b) True
a
10. Mechanical Draft cooling towers do not depend on atmospheric air.
a) True
b) False
a
