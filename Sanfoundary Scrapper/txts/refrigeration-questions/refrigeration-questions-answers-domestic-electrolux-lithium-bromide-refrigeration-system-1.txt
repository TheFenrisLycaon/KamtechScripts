5. Find the COP of the domestic Electrolux system when the heat supplied in the generator (QG) is 1885 KJ/kg and the heat absorbed in the evaporator (Qe) is 1045 KJ/kg.
a) 0.4
b) 0.45
c) 0.55
d) 0.65
c
COP = \(\frac{1045}{1885}\) = 0.554.
6. Which of the refrigerant is used as a refrigerant in Lithium Bromide Absorption Refrigeration system?
a) Ammonia
b) Water
c) Hydrogen
d) Lithium Bromide
b
7. In lithium bromide absorption refrigeration system it is not necessary to keep the refrigeration temperature above 0°C.
a) True
b) False
b
8. Find the COP of the lithium bromide absorption system when the heat supplied in the generator (QG) is 1255 KJ/kg and the heat absorbed in the evaporator (Qe) is 955 KJ/kg.
a) 0.66
b) 0.75
c) 0.85
d) 0.76
d
COP = \(\frac{955}{1255}\) = 0.76.
9. Find the relative COP of the system whose maximum COP is 2.0 and the actual COP is 0.8.
a) 0.5
b) 0.4
c) 0.3
d) 0.6
b
Relative COP = (Actual COP) / (Maximum COP)
= \(\frac{0.8}{2.0}\) = 0.4.
