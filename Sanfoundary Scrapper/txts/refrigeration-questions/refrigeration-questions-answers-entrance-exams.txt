12. What is the ratio of m3 / m2 for the following arrangement?
If, m1 = Mass of refrigerant passing through the evaporator
m2 = Mass of refrigerant passing through condenser
m3 = Mass of vapor refrigerant formed in the flash chamber
a) (h1 – hf6) / (h2 – h1) – (h4 – h3)
b) (h1 – hf6) / (h2 – h1) + (h4 – h3)
c) (h8 – hf10) / (h9 – hf10)
d) (h1 – hf10) / (h4 – h9)
c
Heat taken by the flash chamber = Heat given by the flash chamber
m2 h8 = m3 h9 + m1 hf10
as, m1 = m2 – m3
m2 h8 = m3 h9 + (m2 – m3) hf10
m3 (h9 – hf10) = m2 (h8 – hf10)
m3 / m2 = (h8 – hf10) / (h9 – hf10).
13. What is the value of work done for the following arrangement?
If, m1 = Mass of refrigerant passing through the evaporator
m2 = Mass of refrigerant passing through condenser
m3 = Mass of vapor refrigerant formed in the flash chamber
a) m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h4 – h3)
b) m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h5 – h4)
c) (h8 – hf10) / (h9 – hf10)
d) (h1 – hf10) / (h4 – h9)
b
Work = Work done by low-pressure compressor + Work done by high-pressure compressor
= mass of refrigerant flowing through the low-pressure compressor x enthalpy change + mass of refrigerant flowing through the high-pressure compressor x enthalpy change
Work done by the low-pressure compressor = m1 (h2 – h1)
Work done by the high-pressure compressor = m2 (h5 – h4)
Total work = m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h5 – h4).
14. What is the value of work done for the following arrangement?
If, m1 = Mass of refrigerant passing through the evaporator
m2 = Mass of refrigerant passing through condenser
m3 = Mass of vapor refrigerant formed in the flash chamber
a) m1 (h1 – h11) / m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h4 – h3)
b) m3 (h1 – hf10) / m2 (h4 – h9)
c) m2 (h8 – hf10) / m1 (h9 – hf10)
d) m1 (h1 – h11) / m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h5 – h4)
d
Hence, by taking the help of above diagrams,
R.E. = Heat absorbed in the evaporator
= mass flowing through the evaporator x enthalpy change
= m1 (h1 – h11) as, hf10 = h11
Work = Work done by low-pressure compressor + Work done by high-pressure compressor
= mass of refrigerant flowing through the low-pressure compressor x enthalpy change + mass of refrigerant flowing through the high-pressure compressor x enthalpy change
Total Work = m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h5 – h4)
Hence, C.O.P. = m1 (h1 – h11) / Total work
= m1 (h1 – h11) / m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h5 – h4).
