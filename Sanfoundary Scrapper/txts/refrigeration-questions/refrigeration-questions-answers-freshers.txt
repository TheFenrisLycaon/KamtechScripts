1. Efficiency of the Refrigerator is _________ to the C.O.P of refrigerator.
a) inversely proportional
b) equal
c) independent
d) directly proportional
c
2. What is the C.O.P. of a refrigeration system if the work input is 40 KJ/kg and work output is 80 KJ/kg and refrigeration effect produced is 130 KJ/kg of refrigerant flowing.
a) 3.00
b) 3.25
c) 2.25
d) 3.75
b
       = \(\frac{130}{80-40}\) 
       = 3.25 (unit less).
3. Find the Relative C.O.P. of a refrigeration system if the work input is 100 KJ/kg and refrigeration effect produced is 250 KJ/kg of refrigerant flowing. Also Theoretical C.O.P. is 3.
a) 0.65
b) 0.80
c) 0.83
d) 0.91
c
	       = \(\frac{250}{100}\) 
               = 2.5 (unit less)
Relative C.O.P. = \(\frac{Actual \,C.O.P.}{Theoretical \,C.O.P.}\) 
		= \(\frac{2.5}{3}\) = 0.833 i.e. = 83.3 %.
4. If a condenser and evaporator temperatures are 225 K and 100 K respectively, then reverse Carnot C.O.P is _________
a) 0.5
b) 1.5
c) 1.25
d) 1.75
c
	              = \(\frac{225-100}{100}\) 
	              = 1.25.
5. If a condenser and evaporator temperatures are 312 K and X K respectively, and C.O.P. is given as 5 then find the value of X.
a) 52
b) 65
c) 78
d) 82
a
         	    5  = \(\frac{312-X}{X}\) 
	           6X  = 312
		    X  = 52 K.

6. The C.O.P for reverse Carnot refrigerator is 6. The ratio of lowest temperature to highest temperature will be _____
a) twice
b) three times
c) four times
d) seven times
d
	           6  = \(\frac{X-Y}{Y}\) 
	           6  = \(\frac{X}{Y}\) – 1
 Thus, \(\frac{X}{Y}\) = 7 i.e. X=7Y i.e. Higher temperature = 7 times Lower temperature.
7. In general the ratio of lowest to highest temperature with respect to C.O.P. can be denoted by _________
a) C.O.P + 1 = Ratio of temperature
b) C.O.P/2 = Ratio of temperature
c) C.O.P + 4 = Ratio of temperature
d) C.O.P + 2 = Ratio of temperature
a
8. The C.O.P for reverse Carnot refrigerator is 2. The ratio of highest temperature to lowest temperature will be _____
a) 4 times
b) 3 times
c) 1/2 times
d) 1/3 times
d
	           2  = \(\frac{X-Y}{Y}\) 
		   2  = \(\frac{X}{Y}\) – 1
Thus, \(\frac{X}{Y}\) = 3 i.e. X=3Y i.e. Lowest temperature = \(\frac{1}{3}\) times Highest temperature.
9. The C.O.P of a reverse Carnot cycle doesn’t depend on which of the following?
a) Moisture
b) Evaporator temperature
c) Condenser temperature
d) Work done
a
10. If a condenser and evaporator temperatures are ‘X’ K and 100 K respectively, and reverse Carnot C.O.P is 2.5 then find out the ‘X’.
a) 100 K
b) 150 K
c) 350 K
d) 200 K
c
	          2.5   = \(\frac{X-100}{100}\) 
		    X   = 350 K.
