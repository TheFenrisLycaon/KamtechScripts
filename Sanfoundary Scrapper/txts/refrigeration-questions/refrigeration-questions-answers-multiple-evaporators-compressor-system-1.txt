9. What is the total mass of refrigerant flowing through the compressor if the masses flowing through each evaporator are m1, m2, and m3?
a) m1 – m2 – m3
b) m1 + m2 – m3
c) m1 – m2 + m3
d) m1 + m2 + m3
d
m2 is the mass flowing through EP2 i.e., the second evaporator, which is given by 210 Q2 / h1 – h4
m3 is the mass flowing through EP3 i.e., the third evaporator, which is given by 210 Q3 / h1 – h4
As the evaporators are connected in such a way that masses get converged and then enter into the compressor.
So, mass flowing through the compressor will be the summation of masses flowing through each evaporator.
Mass of refrigerant flowing through compressor, m = m1 + m2 + m3.
10. What is the value of work done in the following arrangement?
a) m1 – m2 – m3 (h2 – h1)
b) m1 + m2 + m3 (h2 – h1)
c) m1 + m2 – m3 (h2 – h1)
d) m1 + m2 + m3 (h4 – h1)
b
m2 is the mass flowing through EP2 i.e., the second evaporator, which is given by 210 Q2 / h1 – h4
m3 is the mass flowing through EP3 i.e., the third evaporator, which is given by 210 Q3 / h1 – h4
As the evaporators are connected in such a way that masses get converged and then enter into the compressor.
So, mass flowing through the compressor will be the summation of masses flowing through each evaporator.
Mass of refrigerant flowing through compressor, m = m1 + m2 + m3
The enthalpy change across the compressor is h1 and h2.
Work done = mass of refrigerant flowing through the compressor x enthalpy change across the compressor.
= m1 + m2 + m3 (h2 – h1).
11. What is the value of the refrigeration effect in the following arrangement?
a) m1 – m2 – m3 (h2 – h1)
b) m1 + m2 + m3 (h4 – h1)
c) m1 + m2 + m3 (h1 – h4)
d) m1 + m2 – m3 (h4 – h1)
c
m2 is the mass flowing through EP2 i.e., the second evaporator, which is given by 210 Q2 / h1 – h4
m3 is the mass flowing through EP3 i.e., the third evaporator, which is given by 210 Q3 / h1 – h4
As the evaporators are connected in such a way that masses get converged and then enter into the compressor.
Total mass of refrigerant flowing through the evaporator, m = m1 + m2 + m3
The enthalpy change across the evaporator is h1 and h4.
Total Refrigeration effect = Total mass of refrigerant flowing through the evaporator x enthalpy change across the evaporator
= m1 + m2+ m3 (h1 – h4).
12. What is the value of C.O.P. in the following arrangement?
a) (h1 – h4) / (h2 – h1)
b) (h1 – h4) / (h4 – h1)
c) (h1 – h2) / (h4 – h1)
d) (h2 – h3) / (h2 – h1)
a
m2 is the mass flowing through EP2 i.e., the second evaporator, which is given by 210 Q2 / h1 – h4
m3 is the mass flowing through EP3 i.e., the third evaporator, which is given by 210 Q3 / h1 – h4
As the evaporators are connected in such a way that masses get converged and then enter into the compressor.
Total mass of refrigerant flowing through the evaporator, m = m1 + m2 + m3
The enthalpy change across the evaporator is h1 and h4.
Total Refrigeration effect = Total mass of refrigerant flowing through the evaporator x enthalpy change across the evaporator
= m1 + m2 + m3 (h1 – h4)
So, mass flowing through the compressor will be the summation of masses flowing through each evaporator.
Mass of refrigerant flowing through compressor, m = m1 + m2 + m3
The enthalpy change across the compressor is h1 and h2.
Work done = mass of refrigerant flowing through the compressor x enthalpy change across the compressor.
= m1 + m2 + m3 (h2 – h1)
So, C.O.P. = Total Refrigeration effect / Work done
= (m1 + m2 + m3) (h1 – h4) / (m1 + m2 + m3) (h2 – h1)
= (h1 – h4) / (h2 – h1).
13. What is the value of C.O.P. in the following arrangement?
If the values of enthalpy at point 1, 2 and 3 are 184, 210 and 75 kJ/kg and masses are m1 = 13 kg/min, m2 = 15 kg/min and m3 = 28.085 kg/min
a) 6.23
b) 1.88
c) 4.19
d) 0.2386
c
Though masses are given but for work done and refrigeration effect, summation is same. So, it is a redundant data.
C.O.P. = R.E. / Work done
= (h1 – h4) / (h2 – h1)
= (184 – 75) / (210 – 184)
= 109 / 26
= 4.19.
14. What is the value of mass flowing through the compressor in the following arrangement?
If the values of enthalpy at point 1, 2 and 3 are 184, 210 and 84 kJ/kg and refrigeration capacities are 10, 15 and 20 TR respectively.
a) 94.5 kg/min
b) 32.6 kg/min
c) 49.5 kg/s
d) 94.5 kg/s
a
Q1 = 10 TR, Q2 = 15 TR and Q3 = 20 TR
As we know, m = 210 Q / (h1 – h4)
m1 is the mass flowing through EP1 i.e. first evaporator, which is given by 210 Q1 / h1 – h4,
m1 = 210 x 10 / (184 – 84) = 2100 / 100 = 21 kg/min
m2 is the mass flowing through EP2 i.e. second evaporator, which is given by 210 Q2 / h1 – h4,
m2 = 210 x 15 / (184 – 84) = 3150 / 100 = 31.5 kg/min
m3 is the mass flowing through EP3 i.e., the third evaporator, which is given by 210 Q3 / h1 – h4,
m3 = 210 x 20 / (184 – 84) = 4200 / 100 = 42 kg/min
So, mass flowing through the compressor will be the summation of masses flowing through each evaporator.
Mass of refrigerant flowing through compressor, m = m1 + m2 + m3
m = 21 + 31.5 + 42 = 94.5 kg/min.
15. What is the value of Refrigeration effect in the following arrangement?
If the values of enthalpy at point 1, 2 and 3 are 170, 240 and 107 kJ/kg and masses are m1 = 13 kg/min, m2 = 15 kg/min and m3 = 19 kg/min
a) 3000 kJ/min
b) 2961 kW
c) 2861 kW
d) 2961 kJ/min
d
Total mass of refrigerant flowing through the evaporator, m = m1 + m2 + m3
Total mass flowing through the evaporator = m1 + m2 + m3 = 13 + 15 + 19 = 47 kg/min
The enthalpy change across the evaporator is h1 and h4.
Total Refrigeration effect = Total mass of refrigerant flowing through the evaporator x enthalpy change across the evaporator
= m1 + m2 + m3 (h1 – h4)
Refrigeration effect = 47 (170 – 107) = 47 x 63 = 2961 kJ/min.
16. What is the power required to run the following arrangement?
If the values of enthalpy at point 1, 2 and 3 are 193, 258 and 56 kJ/kg and masses are m1 = 11 kg/min, m2 = 21 kg/min and m3 = 28 kg/min.
a) 65 kJ/min
b) 65 kW
c) 3900 kW
d) 4000 kJ/min
b
As, the evaporators are connected in such a way that masses get converged and then enter into the compressor.
Total mass of refrigerant flowing through the evaporator, m = m1 + m2 + m3
Total mass flowing through the compressor = m1 + m2 + m3 = 11 + 21 + 28 = 60 kg/min
The enthalpy change across the compressor is h1 and h2.
Work done = Total mass of refrigerant flowing through the compressor x enthalpy change across the compressor.
= m1 + m2 + m3 (h2 – h1)
Work done = 60 (258 – 193) = 60 x 65 = 3900 kJ/min
Power = Work done / 60 = 3900 / 60 = 65 kW.
