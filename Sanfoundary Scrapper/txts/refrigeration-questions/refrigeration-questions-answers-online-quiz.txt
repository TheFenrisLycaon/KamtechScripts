1. Why is the evaporator used?
a) To improve C.O.P.
b) To decrease the refrigeration effect
c) To absorb heat
d) To reject heat
c
2. What is the pressure side of a refrigerating system in which evaporator is used?
a) Low pressure
b) Zero pressure
c) Negative pressure
d) High pressure
a
3. Evaporator is also called as Freezing, cooling or chilling coil.
a) False
b) True
b
4. What evaporator does to the refrigerant coming from expansion valve in terms of state?
a) high-pressure liquid refrigerant
b) low-pressure liquid and vapor refrigerant
c) low-pressure vapor refrigerant
d) high-pressure vapor refrigerant
b
5. What is the formula for the capacity of evaporator?
a) Q = U A2 (T2 – T1)
b) Q = U A (T2 – T1)
c) Q = A (T2 – T1)
d) Q = U (T2 – T1)
b
Q = U A (T2 – T1), where U is overall heat transfer coefficient, A is the surface area of the evaporator and T1 & T2 are the saturation temperature of refrigerant and temperature of the medium to be cooled respectively.
6. Which of the following is not a factor affecting the capacity of evaporator?
a) Velocity of refrigerant
b) The thickness of the evaporator coil wall
c) Material
d) Evaporator pressure
d
7. What is the value of the fluid side heat transfer coefficient when liquid flows through the evaporator shell?
a) C x m
b) C x (m)0.5
c) C x (m)2
d) C x (m)3
b
hf = [(CK / D) (V Dρ / μ)0.8 (Cp μ / K)0.4] W / m2 K
So, for liquid flowing through the shell, the value is hf = C x (m)0.5 = C x √m.
8. What is the value of fluid side heat transfer coefficient when air flows over finned coil by forced convection?
a) C x (m)0.1
b) C x (m)0.2
c) C x (m)0.3
d) C x (m)0.4
d
hf = [(CK / D) (V D ρ / μ)0.8 (Cp μ / K)0.4] W / m2 K
So, for air flowing over finned coil by forced convection, the value is hf = C x (m)0.4
9. What is the value of the fluid side heat transfer coefficient when air flows over cold pipes by natural convection?
a) 0.2 (Ta – Tm / D)1/4
b) 0.2 (Ta – Tm / D)
c) 0.2 (Ta – Tm / D)1/3
d) 0.2 (Ta – Tm / D)1/2
a
hf = [(CK / D) (V D ρ / μ)0.8 (Cp μ / K)0.4] W / m2 K
So, for air flowing over cold pipes by natural convection, the value is hf = 0.2 (Ta – Tm / D)1/4

b) bare surface
c) pipe surface
d) prime surface
d
11. Which type of evaporator is generally used in home freezers, ice cream cabinets, etc?
a) Shell and coil evaporator
b) Finned evaporator
c) Shell and tube evaporator
d) Plate evaporator
d
12. Which type of evaporator is generally used for wine cooling and chilling oil in the petroleum industry?
a) Tube-in-tube evaporator
b) Finned evaporator
c) Shell and tube evaporator
d) Plate evaporator
a
13. Which type of evaporator is used in household refrigerators?
a) frosting evaporator
b) defrosting evaporator
c) non-frosting evaporator
d) non-corrosive evaporator
a
14. Which type of evaporator is generally used to cool drinking water?
a) Shell and tube evaporator
b) Finned evaporator
c) Shell and coil evaporator
d) Plate evaporator
c
15. Finned evaporators are also known as prime surface evaporators.
a) False
b) True
a
