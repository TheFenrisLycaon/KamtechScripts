d) Expansion
d
5. What does the process 2-3 represent?

b) Evaporation
c) Compression
d) Expansion
b
6. What does point 2 say about the state of refrigerant?
a) Wet vapor
b) Dry saturated vapor
c) Superheated vapor
d) Liquid refrigerant
b
7. What is the value of C.O.P. for the following p-h chart?
a) (h1 − h4) / (h2 − h1)
b) (h3 − h4) / (h2 − h1)
c) (h2 − h4) / (h2 − h3)
d) (h1 − h2) / (h3 − h4)
a
As, Refrigerating effect = Process 1-4 = h1 − h4
Work done = Process 1-2 = h2 − h1
Hence, C.O.P. = (h1 − h4) / (h2 − h1).
8. Find out the value of C.O.P. for the given values of enthalpies.
h1 = 1126.25 kJ/kg
h4 = 250.25 kJ/kg
W = 120 kJ/kg
a) 5.3
b) 6.3
c) 7.3
d) 8.3
c
Work = 120 kJ/kg
C.O.P. = Refrigerating effect / Work done
= 876 / 120
= 7.3.
9. If a process 1 – 2 undergoes a throttling. Which of the following represents the process 1 – 2?
a) T1 = T2
b) S1 = S2
c) P1 = P2
d) H1 = H2
d
T1 = T2 is the isothermal process.
S1 = S2 is an isentropic process.
P1 = P2 is an isobaric process.
10. In a vapor compression refrigeration system, the coefficient of performance is observed as 10. If the enthalpy after compression is 1368.28 kJ/kg and after condensation is 598.58 kJ/kg. If the system works on 50% of the C.O.P., then what is the value of enthalpy after evaporation?
a) 1220
b) 1210
c) 1240
d) 1280
c
h2 = 1368.28 kJ/kg
h4 = h3 = 598.58 kJ/kg
Calculations: Actual C.O.P. = 50 * 10 / 100 = 5
As, C.O.P. = (h1 − h4) / (h2 − h1)
5 = (h1 − 598.58) / (1368.28 − h1)
h1 = 1239.99 = 1240 kJ/kg.
