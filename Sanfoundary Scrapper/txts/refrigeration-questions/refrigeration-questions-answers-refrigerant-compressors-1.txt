1. What is the purpose of using a refrigerant compressor?
a) Raise the temperature of refrigerant
b) Reduce the temperature of refrigerant
c) Reduce the pressure of refrigerant
d) Expand the refrigerant
a
2. What must be the state of refrigerant entering the compressor?
a) Dry saturated vapour refrigerant
b) Dry saturated liquid refrigerant
c) Vapour and liquid mixture
d) Superheated vapour refrigerant
d
3. What is the pressure at the outlet of a refrigerant compressor?
a) Critical pressure
b) Suction pressure
c) Discharge pressure
d) Backpressure
c
4. What is the pressure at the inlet of a refrigerant compressor?
a) Critical pressure
b) Suction pressure
c) Discharge pressure
d) Backpressure
b
5. Where is the reciprocating compressor mostly suitable?
a) Small displacements and low condensing pressures
b) Small displacements and high condensing pressures
c) Large displacements and low condensing pressures
d) Large displacements and high condensing pressures
b
6. Which represents compressor ratio or pressure ratio among the following?
a) Relative discharge pressure / Relative suction pressure
b) Relative discharge pressure / Absolute suction pressure
c) Absolute discharge pressure / Relative suction pressure
d) Absolute discharge pressure / Absolute suction pressure
d
7. How is the compressor ratio defined in terms of volume?
a) Clearance volume / Total volume of the cylinder
b) Clearance volume / Swept volume of the cylinder
c) Total volume of cylinder / Clearance volume of the cylinder
d) Total volume of cylinder / Swept volume of the cylinder
c
8. What is the formula for swept volume?
If, D = Diameter of cylinder
L = Length of the piston stroke
a) π D L
b) π D L / 2
c) π D L / 4
d) π D2 L / 4
d
Here, D is diameter so for a circle with diameter D area = π D2 / 4
So, swept volume = π D2 / 4 x L = π D2 L / 4.
9. What is the value of the clearance factor?
If, VC = Clearance volume and VP = Piston displacement volume
a) VC x VP
b) VC / VP
c) VP / VC
d) VC + VP
b
10. What is the volume of the amount of refrigerant passing through compressor called?
a) Compressor rating
b) Compressor ratio
c) Compressor capacity
d) Compressor efficiency
c
11. What the meaning of VS?
a) Surface volume
b) Suction volume
c) Swept volume
d) Secondary piston volume
b
12. What is the volumetric efficiency?
a) VP / VS
b) VC / VS
c) VS / VC
d) VS / VP
d
13. Clearance volume can be zero.
a) False
b) True
a
14. Mixture of liquid and vapour state of refrigerant reduces overall work done.
a) False
b) True
a
15. Pressure or compression ratio is always __________
a) equal to one
b) less than one
c) greater than one
d) zero
c
