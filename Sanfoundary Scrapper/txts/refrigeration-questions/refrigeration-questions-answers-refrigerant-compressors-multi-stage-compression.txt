1. Why is multi-stage compression used?
a) To improve C.O.P.
b) To decrease the refrigeration effect
c) To increase work
d) To increase leakage loss
a
2. What is the expression for optimum intercooler or intermediate pressure P2 if the cooling ratio is fixed in a compound compression refrigeration system with intercooling?
a) P2 = P1 / P3
b) P2 = P3 / P1
c) P2 = √P1 x P3
d) P2 = ∛P1 x P3
c
T1 P2k – 1 / P1k = T3 P3k / P2k + 1
For the given conditions T1 = T3,
P2 x P2 = P1 x P3
P2 = √P1 x P3.
3. Multistage compression provides effective lubrication.
a) False
b) True
b
4. What is the value of optimum intermediate pressure is the cooling ratio is fixed in a compound VCR with intercooling having suction and discharge pressure as 2 and 8 bar respectively?
a) 2 bar
b) 4 bar
c) 6 bar
d) 8 bar
b
T1 P2k – 1 / P1k = T3 P3k / P2k + 1
For the given conditions T1 = T3,
P2 x P2 = P1 x P3
P2 = √P1 x P3
= √2 x 8
= 4 bar.
5. Which of the following is not true about single-stage compression?
a) Size of the cylinder is very large
b) Difficult to reject a good amount of heat in a lesser time of compression
c) Volumetric efficiency will be low
d) Safe at a higher temperature
d
