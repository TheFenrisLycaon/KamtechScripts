a
12. __________ based refrigerant is represented by two digits, followed by R?

b) Propane
c) Ammonia
d) Methane
d
13. Dichloro-trifluoro-ethane has a refrigerant number of R-113 as per designation system.
a) False
b) True
a
n = 1, p = 2 and q = 3. Hence, by using n + p + q = 2m + 2, we get m = 2.
So, R (m – 1) (n + 1) (q) = R (2 – 1) (1 + 1) (3) = R123 = R – 123.
14. Dichloro-difluoro-methane has refrigerant number of R-12 as per designation system.
a) False
b) True
b
n = 0, p = 2 and q = 2. Hence, by using n + p + q = 2m + 2, we get m = 1.
So, R (m – 1) (n + 1) (q) = R (1 – 1) (0 + 1) (2) = R012 = R – 12 as 0 can be omitted.
15. ________ refrigerants follow a formula where the molecular mass of the compound is added.
a) Halocarbon
b) Halo hydrogen
c) Inorganic
d) Azeotrope
c
