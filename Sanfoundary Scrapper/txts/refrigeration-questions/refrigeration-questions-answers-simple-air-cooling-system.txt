1. Which one of the following is not a component of a simple air cooling system?
a) Main compressor
b) Cooling fan
c) Heat exchanger
d) Generator
d
2. For a simple air cooling system which one of the following is not a process of the cycle in T-S diagram?
a) Ramming process
b) Compression process
c) Heating process
d) Refrigeration process
c
3. The COP of simple air cooling system is given by?
T6 = Inside temperature of cabin
T5′ = Exit temperature of cooling turbine
T3′ = Temperature at the exit of compressor
T2′ = Stagnation temperature
a) COP = \(\frac{(T_6 – T_{5′})}{(T_3′ – T_{2′})}\) 
b) COP = \(\frac{(T_6 + T_{5′})}{(T_3′ – T_{2′})}\) 
c) COP = \(\frac{(T_6 + T_{5′})}{(T_3′ + T_{2′})}\) 
d) COP = \(\frac{(T_6 – T_{5′})}{(T_3′ + T_{2′})}\) 
a
Hence COP = \(\frac{(T_6 – T_{5′})}{(T_3′ – T_{2′})}\).
4. The simple air cooling system is good for _____ flight speed.
a) low
b) high
c) moderate
d) any

5. What is the main difference between simple air cooling system and simple air evaporative cooling system?
a) Simple air evaporative cooling system has an evaporator
b) Simple air evaporative cooling system has two evaporators
c) Simple air evaporative cooling system has an extra compressor
d) Simple air evaporative cooling system has three evaporators
a
6. If cooling of 45 minutes or less is required, it may be advantageous to use evaporative cooling system.
a) True
b) False
a
7. A simple evaporative air refrigeration system is used for an airplane to take 20 TR of refrigeration load (Q). The power required for the refrigerating system P is 746 KW. What is its COP?
a) 0.086
b) 0.094
c) 0.079
d) 0.099
b
COP = \(\frac{(210×20)}{(746×60)}\) 
= 0.094.
