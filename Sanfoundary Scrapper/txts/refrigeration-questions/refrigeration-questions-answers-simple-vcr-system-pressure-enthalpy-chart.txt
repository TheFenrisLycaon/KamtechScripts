1. What is the effect of using a flash chamber in VCR system?
a) C.O.P. increases
b) C.O.P. decreases
c) C.O.P. remains the same
d) Mass of refrigerant flowing through evaporator increases
c
C.O.P. = h1 − hf3 / h2 − h1
Which is same as the simple VCR cycle. The purest forms of refrigerant enter the respective system but effectively do not give enormous impact on C.O.P., So C.O.P. remains the same.
The mass of refrigerant required to flow through the evaporator decreases as even the smaller amount can produce the same refrigeration effect from its pure liquid form, resulting in a reduction in the size of evaporator.
2. From the following line diagram and p-h chart, what is the refrigeration effect in terms of the mass of mixture i.e., m2?
a) m2 (h1 − hf3)
b) m2 (h2 − h1)
c) m2 (h1 − h2)
d) m2 (h4 − h1)
a
R.E. = m1 (h1 − hf4’)
And also, m1 / m2 = h1 − h4 / h1 − hf4’
Hence, R.E. = m2 (h1 − hf3)
3. What is the value of C.O.P. in the VCR with flash chamber?
a) h1 – h2 / h1 – h4
b) h1 – hf3 / h2 – h1
c) h2 – h1 / h4 – h1
d) h1 – hf4’ / h1 – h4
b
Refrigerating effect in terms of m2 = m2 (h1 – hf3)
Work = m2 (h2 – h1)
C.O.P. = m2 (h1 – hf3) / m2 (h2 – h1)
C.O.P. = (h1 – hf3) / (h2 – h1)
4. What is the effect of using accumulator in the VCR system?
a) C.O.P. increases
b) C.O.P. decreases
c) Total dry compression of refrigerant occurs
d) Sub-cooling happens
c
C.O.P. = h1 – hf3 / h2 – h1
Which is same as the simple VCR cycle. The purest forms of refrigerant enter the respective system but effectively do not give enormous impact on C.O.P. So C.O.P. remains the same.
The C.O.P., R.E., and power required are the same, but it protects the liquid refrigerant from entering the compressor. Dry compression is always ensured by using accumulator or pre-cooler.
5. What is the value of C.O.P. in the VCR with a flash chamber?
a) h1 – h2 / h1 – h4
b) h1 – hf3 / h2 – h1
c) h2 – h1 / h4 – h1
d) h1 – hf4’ / h1 – h4
b
Refrigerating effect in terms of m2 = m2 (h1 – hf3)
Work = m2 (h2 – h1)
C.O.P. = m2 (h1 – hf3) / m2 (h2 – h1)
C.O.P. = (h1 – hf3) / (h2 – h1)
6. From the following line diagram and p-h chart, what is the power required in terms of the mass of refrigerant flowing in the condenser i.e., m2?
a) m2 (h1 – h2) / 60
b) m2 (h1 – h4) / 60
c) m2 (h2 – h1) / 60
d) m2 (h1’ – hf4’) / 60
c
Hence, the power required is the work done per unit time.
Power i.e. P = Work / 60 (kW)
Work = m2 (h2 – h1)
P = m2 (h2 – h1) / 60.
7. What is the effect of using the following arrangement of VCR?
a) C.O.P. increases
b) C.O.P. decreases
c) Total dry compression of refrigerant occurs
d) Sub-cooling does not occur
b
8. What is the ratio of the mass of the vapor refrigerant and mass of the liquid refrigerant i.e., m1 / m2?
a) 1
b) h1 – h4 / h1’ – hf4’
c) 0
d) h1’ – hf4’ / h1 – h4
a
m1 = m2 or m1 / m2 = 1 = mR = 210 Q / (h1 – hf3’) kg/min.
9. What is the value of excess power required in this arrangement of VCR if P1 is the power required without heat exchanger and P2 is the power required with heat exchanger?
a) Pexcess = P1 / P2
b) Pexcess = P1 x P2
c) Pexcess = P1 + P2
d) Pexcess = P1 – P2
d
P1 = mR (h2’ – h1’) / 60 = 210 Q [h2’ – h1’ / h1 – hf3’] / 60
Power required to drive the compressor without heat exchanger,
P2 = mR (h2 – h1) / 60 = 210 Q [h2 – h1 / h1 – hf3] / 60
Pexcess = P1 – P2
= 210 [(h2’ – h1’ / h1 – hf3’) – (h2 – h1 / h1 – hf3)] / 60 kW.
10. What is the value of C.O.P. in the VCR with a heat exchanger in the following diagram?
a) h1 – h2 / h1 – h4
b) h1 – hf3 / h2 – h1
c) h2 – h1 / h4 – h1
d) h1 – hf4’ / h1 – h4
b
Refrigerating effect in terms of m2 = m2 (h1 – hf3)
Work = m2 (h2 – h1)
C.O.P. = m2 (h1 – hf3) / m2 (h2 – h1)
C.O.P. = (h1 – hf3) / (h2 – h1).
11. What is effect of using flash chamber in the following VCR system arrangement?
a) C.O.P. remains the same
b) C.O.P. decreases
c) C.O.P. increases
d) Subcooling affects significantly on C.O.P.
a
C.O.P. = h1 – hf3 / h2 – h1
Which is same as the simple VCR cycle. The purest forms of refrigerant enter the respective system but effectively do not give enormous impact on C.O.P. So C.O.P. remains the same.
The subcooling of liquid refrigerant is of no advantage. The above method of subcooling is thermodynamically the same as the simple saturation cycle.
12. Mass of refrigerant required in the heat exchanger is exactly equal to the mass of flash that would form in a simple saturation cycle.
a) True
b) False
a
