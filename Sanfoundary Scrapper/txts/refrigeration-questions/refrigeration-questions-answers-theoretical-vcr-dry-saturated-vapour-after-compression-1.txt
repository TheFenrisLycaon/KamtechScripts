1. In vapor compression cycle having dry saturated vapor at the end of compression the work done is given by?
H2 – Enthalpy of vapor after compression
H1 – Enthalpy of vapor before compression
a) H2 – H1
b) H2 + H1
c) H2 × H1
d) H2 ÷ H1
a
2. In vapor compression cycle having dry saturated vapor at the end of compression the refrigeration effect is given by?
H1 – Enthalpy of vapor before compression
H4 – Enthalpy of vapor before entering evaporator
H2 – Enthalpy of vapor after compression
a) H1 – H4
b) H2 – H4
c) H1 × H4
d) H2 × H4
a
3. The COP  of vapor compression having vapor as dry saturated after compression having refrigeration effect (Re) of 58.84  and work done (W) of 17.95 is ________
a) 3.278
b) 4.39
c) 4.234
d) 3.865
a
COP=\(\frac{Re}{W}\) 
=\(\frac{58.84}{17.95}\)=3.278.
4. Entropy of dry-saturated vapor when Sf is 0.2513 and Sfg is 4.7878, is _______
Sf – Entropy of saturated liquid at pressure p
Sfg – Entropy change during vaporization
a) 6.987
b) 5.987
c) 5.0391
d) 4.776
c
Sg = Sf + Sfg = 0.2513+4.7878 = 5.0391.
5. One of the assumptions of the vapor compression cycle is that all of the processes are reversible.
a) True
b) False
a
6. In which case does the compression process remains in superheated state?
a) Wet state
b) Dry state
c) Semi-dry state
d) Always
b
7. Dry compression is preferred over wet compression.
a) True
b) False
a
8. The ratio of COP of vapor compression cycle and COP of Carnot cycle is known as?
a) Relative COP
b) Ideal COP
c) Performance index
d) Theoretical COP
c
