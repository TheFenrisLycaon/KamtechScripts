1. The COP of vapor compression when vapor is wet after compression having refrigeration effect (Re) of 60 and work done (W) of 20 is?
a) 3
b) 4
c) 4.2
d) 5
a
COP=\(\frac{Re}{W}\) 
= \(\frac{60}{20}\) = 3.0.
2. Which case is when the refrigerant compression process is carried while it’s wet?
a) Wet state
b) Dry state
c) Semi-dry state
d) Always
a
3. In case of reciprocating compressors, wet compression is avoided.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Which one of the following is not an assumption in theoretical vapour compression cycle?
a) There are no pressure losses in the condenser, evaporator, compressor, valves and the connecting part lines
b) All processes are reversible
c) There are mechanical and fluid friction losses
d) There is no heat transfer between the system and surroundings except in the evaporator and condenser
c
5. Power consumption in dry compression is less than wet compression.
a) True
b) False
b
6. Due to what in wet-compression affects the heat transfer rates from the vapor refrigerant to the cooling medium?
a) Liquid droplets
b) Work consumed
c) Power required
d) In wet-compression the heat transfer remains unaffected
a
7. The following p – h diagram indicates?
a) Vapor compression when vapor is dry at the end of the compression
b) Vapor compression when vapor is wet at the end of the compression
c) Vapor compression when vapor is dry – saturated at the end of the compression
d) Vapor compression when vapor is dry before of compression
b
