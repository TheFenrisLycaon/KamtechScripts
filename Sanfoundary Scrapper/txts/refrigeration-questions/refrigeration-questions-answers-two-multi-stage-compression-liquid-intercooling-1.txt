1. Which one of the following is not an advantage of compound vapor compression with intercooler?
a) It improves the volumetric efficiency for the given pressure ratio
b) It reduces the leakage losses
c) It provides effective lubrication
d) It does not give a uniform torque
d
2. What type of compound vapor compression is the following diagram of?
a) Two stage vapor compression with liquid intercooler
b) Three stage vapor compression with liquid intercooler
c) Two stage vapor compression with flash intercooler
d) Three stage vapor compression with flash intercooler
a
The diagram itself shows that it consists of two stage vapor compression with liquid intercooler from the process (1 – 2) and (3 – 4). For three stages there would have been three such processes.
3. Liquid refrigerant is used for inter cooling commonly in multi stage ammonia plants.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Liquid refrigerant is not used for inter cooling in multi stage R- 12 plants.
a) True
b) False

5. A compound vapour compression with an intercooler system is used to take 10 TR of refrigeration load (Q). The power required for the refrigerating system P is 550 KW. What is its COP?
a) 0.078
b) 0.086
c) 0.063
d) 0.089
c
COP = \(\frac{210×10}{550×60}\) 
= 0.063.
6. Which of the following is not a disadvantage of multiple compressions with intercooling between the stages?
a) Increases the initial cost
b) Size of plant increases
c) Increases the maintenance cost
d) Cylinder wall thickness of low pressure cylinder is increased
d
7. Why intercooling by liquid refrigerant never used in R-12 systems?
a) High latent heat of vaporization
b) Low latent heat of vaporization
c) Medium latent heat of vaporization
d) High toxicity
b
8. The refrigeration effect produced by a system is 10 TR and work done by the low-pressure compressor, and high-pressure compressor is 3 and 4 kW respectively. What is the value of C.O.P. for the given conditions?
a) 8.75
b) 11.67
c) 3.5
d) 5
d
Low-pressure compressor work, WL = 3 kW
High-pressure compressor work, WH = 4 kW
C.O.P. = R.E. / Total Work
= R.E. / WL + WH
= 35 / (3 + 4)
= 35 / 7
= 5.
