c
7. What is the mass of refrigerant passing through the evaporator in terms of enthalpies?
a) 210 Q / (h1 – h2)
b) 210 Q / (h2 – h3)
c) 210 Q / (h1 – h4)
d) 210 Q / (h1 – h7)
d
Hence, m = R.E. / delta (h)
R.E. = TR = 210 Q kJ/min = 3.5 Q kW
Delta (h) = h1 – hf6 = h1 – h7
m = 210 Q / (h1 – h7).
8. What is the value of C.O.P. for the following arrangement?
a) (h1 – hf6) / (h2 – h1) – (h4 – h3)
b) (h1 – hf6) / (h2 – h1) + (h4 – h3)
c) (h1 – hf6) / (h2 – h1)
d) (h1 – hf6) / (h4 – h3)
b
Hence, by taking the help of above diagrams,
R.E. = Heat absorbed in the evaporator
= mass flowing through the evaporator x enthalpy change
= m1 (h1 – hf6)  as, hf6 = h7
Work = Work done by low-pressure compressor + Work done by high-pressure compressor
= mass of refrigerant flowing through the low-pressure compressor x enthalpy change + mass of refrigerant flowing through the high-pressure compressor x enthalpy change
Work = m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h4 – h3) but here m1 = m2
Hence, C.O.P. = m1 (h1 – hf5) / m1 (h2 – h1) + m2 (h4 – h3)
= (h1 – hf6) / (h2 – h1) + (h4 – h3).
9. In a compound vapour compression system, the mass flow rate of 2 kg/min is observed. The enthalpies related to point 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the following figure are 1350, 1580, 1540 and 1650 kJ/kg respectively. What is the amount of power required to run this system?
a) 11.33 kW
b) 22.66 kW
c) 680 kW
d) 5.67 kW
a
h1 = 1350 kJ/kg
h2 = 1580 kJ/kg
h3 = 1540 kJ/kg
h4 = 1650 kJ/kg
As, work = m [(h2 – h1) + (h4 – h3)] 
= 2 [(1580 – 1350) + (1650 – 1540)] 
= 2 [230 + 110] 
= 680 kJ/min
Power required = Work / 60
= 680 / 60
= 11.33 kW.
