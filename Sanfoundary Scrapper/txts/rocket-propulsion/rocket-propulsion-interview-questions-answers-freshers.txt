1. Which of the following is not an external force acting on a vehicle flying in the earth’s atmosphere?
a) Thrust
b) Aerodynamic forces
c) Gravitational forces
d) Forces due to thermal stress
d
2. Which of the following is a reasonable factor of increase for effective exhaust velocity (c) as altitude is increased?
a) 1.5
b) 2.1
c) 3.2
d) 4.5
a
3. If L denotes the lift and ∅ denotes flight path angle, then what is the aerodynamic force acting normal to the flight path?
a) Lcos ∅
b) Lsin ∅
c) Lsec ∅
d) L
d
4. In writing the expressions for CL and CD for missiles and rockets, what does area A denote?
a) Sum of all the fin areas
b) The total surface area of the missile/rocket including the fins
c) Maximum cross-sectional area normal to the missile axis
d) Minimum cross-sectional area normal to the missile axis
c
5. What is the angle of attack for a missile?
a) The angle between the local horizon and the missile axis
b) The angle between the local horizon and the missile flight path
c) The angle between the missile axis and its flight path
d) The angle between the relative wind and the missile longitudinal axis
c
6. The lift and drag coefficients are not primarily a function of ____________
a) vehicle configuration
b) flight Mach number
c) angle of attack
d) vehicle mass
d
7. What is the loss of velocity increment experienced by a rocket as a result of drag in the atmosphere?
a) 5-10%
b) 15-20%
c) 25-30%
d) 35-40%
a
8. Which of the following is the correct expression for gravitational acceleration (g) at a height h, given go refers to gravitational acceleration on the earth’s surface and Ro refers to effective radius of earth?
a) g=go[Ro/(Ro+h)]2
b) g=go[Ro/(Ro-h)]2
c) g=go[(Ro+h)/2Ro]2
d) g=go[(Ro-h)/2Ro]2
a
go = GM/Ro2
g = GM/(Ro + h)2
⇒ g/go = Ro/(Ro+h)2.
9. Dynamic pressure experienced by the rocket in the lower atmosphere is ______ compared to that experienced at higher altitudes.
a) more
b) less
c) equal
d) any random value
b
