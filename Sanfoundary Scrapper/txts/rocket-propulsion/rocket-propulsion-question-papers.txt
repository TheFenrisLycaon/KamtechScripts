1. In which of these following altitudes does a rocket exhibit narrow pencil shaped exhaust plume?
a) Low altitude
b) Above atmosphere
c) Outer space
d) During launch
a
2. What are the primary sources of radiation in a chemical rocket engine?
a) Excitation of molecules in the combustion chamber
b) De-excitation of internal modes of gas molecules
c) Rapid combustion of injector fuel
d) Shock layer at the nozzle exit
b
3. Determine the chamber pressure for a rocket engine if the thrust coefficient is 1.8, the throat area is 0.2 m2 and the total thrust is 20000 N.
a) 61.33 kPa
b) 67.98 kPa
c) 45.67 kPa
d) 55.56 kPa
d
Then, Pc = F/(At Cf) = 20000/(0.2×1.8) = 55.56 kPa.
4. Determine the mass ratio (Burnout mass/ Initial mass) of a vehicle in a gravitation less space if its velocity is boosted from 800 m/s to 1600 m/s and the effective rocket exhaust velocity is 2000 m/s.
a) 0.85
b) 0.33
c) 0.67
d) 0.25
c
where δu = uf – ui = 1600 – 800 = 800 m/s.
Then Mb/Mo = 1/exp(800/2000) = 0.67.
5. Which of the following correspond to the spectral bands of CO2 and H2O respectively in the IR signature of rocket exhaust plumes?
a) 2.7μm and 4.3μm
b) 7.2 μm and 3.4μm
c) 4.3 μm and 2.7 μm
d) 3.4 μm and 7.2μm
c
6. For strong emission signature of exhaust plumes, afterburning of fuel-rich gases is optimum for invisibility.
a) True
b) False
b
7. If A is the pre-exponential factor, n is the temperature exponent, Ea is the activation energy, then the expression for forward rate constant according to Arrhenius law is ______
a) kf = ATn exp(-Ea/RT)
b) kf = T exp(-EaA/RTn)
c) kf = ATn exp(-Ea/RTn)
d) kf = AT exp(-Ea/nRT)
a
8. Which of the following is the mixing layer of a nozzle core flow?
a) Inviscid inner core flow
b) Viscous outer core flow
c) Inviscid outer core flow
d) Viscous inner core flow
b
9. At which of the following altitudes does the infrared emissions from the mixing zone of the rocket exhaust higher?
a) near sea level
b) Stratospheric region
c) Just outside the atmosphere
d) Outer space
a
10. Afterburning can lead to ozone layer depletion.
a) True
b) False
a
