1. A rocket produces a total thrust of 20,000 N. If the mass flow rate of propellants is 16 kg/s, what will be effective exhaust velocity?
a) 1250 m/s
b) 2500 m/s
c) 625 m/s
d) 5000 m/s
a
So, 20,000 = 16 x ueff
ueff = 20,000/16 = 1250 m/s.
2. What is the characteristic velocity of a rocket if the chamber pressure is 5 MPa, the nozzle throat diameter is 75 mm and the mass flow rate is 25 kg/s?
a) 884 m/s
b) 1768 m/s
c) 3536 m/s
d) 442 m/s
a
So, Characteristic velocity = [5 x 106 x π x (75 x 10-3)2/4] / 25 = 884 m/s.
3. Characteristic velocity is a performance parameter that relates to the efficiency of _____
a) nozzle
b) combustion chamber
c) injector
d) casing
b
4. Which of the following variables is not useful in the determination of rocket effective exhaust velocity?
a) Mass flow rate
b) Exhaust velocity
c) Rocket velocity
d) Exit area
c
5. If C denotes effective exhaust velocity and Isp is specific impulse, then which of them is a better performance parameter?
a) C
b) Isp
c) Both of them are equal
d) Both of them are equivalent
d
6. If mo denotes initial mass, mb denotes burnout mass, then what is the expression for mass ratio?
a) (mo-mb)/mb
b) (mo-mb)/mo
c) mb/(mo-mb)
d) mb/mo
d
7. For a rocket traveling at 700 m/s having an exhaust velocity of 1.4 km/s, exhaust gas density of 0.3 kg/m3, nozzle throat diameter of 0.14 cm and nozzle exit diameter of 25 cm, find the total mass flow rate of the propellants.
a) 6.46 kg/s
b) 103.1 kg/s
c) 20.62 kg/s
d) 32.33 kg/s
c
m = ρ Ae ue
= 0.3 x π/4 x (25 x 10-2)2 x 1400
= 20.62 kg/s.
8. What constitutes the exhaust gas at the nozzle exit of a chemical rocket engine?
a) combustion products of the propellants
b) A mixture of combustion products and surrounding air
c) Surrounding air
d) Propellants
a
9. Which of the following is not part of a rocket nozzle?
a) Convergent section
b) Divergent section
c) Throat section
d) Staggering section
d
10. What is the nozzle throat diameter of a rocket having chamber pressure (Pc) of 3 MPa, mass flow rate (m) of 20 kg/s and characteristic velocity (c*) of 1500 m/s?
a) 10 cm
b) 11.3 cm
c) 12.8 cm
d) 25 cm
b
At = 1500 x 20/(3 x 106) = 0.01 m2
At = πd2/4
d = \(\sqrt{(\frac{4A_t}{π})}\) 
= \(\sqrt{(\frac{4 * 0.01}{π})}\) 
= 0.112 m or 11.2 cm.
