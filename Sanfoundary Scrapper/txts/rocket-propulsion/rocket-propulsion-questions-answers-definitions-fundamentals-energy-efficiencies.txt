1. Which form of energy is most useful for propulsion?
a) The kinetic energy of ejected matter
b) The chemical energy of combustion of propellants
c) The potential energy of the rocket at some altitude
d) The electrical energy of the rocket control system
a
2. For a constant gas ejection velocity (v) of 1440 m/s and a mass flow rate (m) of 15 kg/s, find the power of the jet (Pjet).
a) 7.78 MW
b) 15.55 MW
c) 31.10 MW
d) 62.21 MW
b
Pjet = 1/2 x 15 x 14402
= 15.55 MW.
3. If the power of the jet is given to be 25 MW for a chemical rocket having a weight flow rate of 147 N/s, find out the vehicle’s specific impulse.
a) 98.2 s
b) 372.6 s
c) 186.3 s
d) 243.5 s
c
Pjet = 1/2 wo go Isp2
Isp = \(\sqrt{(2Pjet/ ẇ_o g_o)}\) 
= \(\sqrt{(2 * 25 * 10^6 /(147 * 9.8))}\) 
= 186.3 s.
4. If a chemical rocket has a jet power of 18 MW, inert mass of 50 kg, a propellant mass of 1000 kg, then what is its specific power?
a) 34.28 kW/kg
b) 17.14 kW/kg
c) 8.91 kW/kg
d) 25.43 kW/kg
b
Pspec = Pjet / mtotal
mtotal = minert + mprop
= 50 + 1000 = 1050 kg
∴ Pspec = 18 x 106 / 1050
= 17.14 kW/kg.
5. What is the way of production of energy in a chemical rocket?
a) Ionization of propellants
b) Combustion of propellants
c) Expulsion of propellants
d) Atomization of propellants
b
6. Which of the following Is the maximum energy available per unit mass of chemical propellants?
a) heat of combustion
b) enthalpy of vaporization
c) enthalpy of atomization
d) enthalpy of fusion
a
7. For a propulsive device, if power available is denoted by P1, power input by P2, combustion efficiency by e, then which of the following expression is correct?
a) P1=P2*e
b) P1=P2/e
c) P1=P2/e2
d) P1=P2*e2
a
8. If a propulsion system produces a thrust of 5 kN, exhaust velocity of 4500 m/s, and vehicle velocity of 3000 m/s, what is the power transmitted to the vehicle?
a) 225 MW
b) 75 MW
c) 10 MW
d) 15 MW
d
Ptrans = T v
= 5 x 103 x 3000
= 15 MW.
9. Which of the following is not a way of losing energy in a chemical rocket?
a) Poor mixing
b) Incomplete burning
c) Heat loss to the walls
d) Radial combustion propagation
d
10. For a rocket having 95% combustion efficiency, total chemical power of 17MW, a mass flow rate of propellants of 15 kg/s, and effective jet exhaust velocity of 1443 m/s, find the internal efficiency of rocket propulsion.
a) 97%
b) 95%
c) 93%
d) 91%
a
Pav chem = ηcomb x Ptot chem
= 0.95 x 17 x 106 W
ηint = Pkinetic / Pav chem
= 1/2μe2 / Pchem
= 0.5 x 15 x 14432 / (0.95 x 17 x 106)
≅ 0.966.
