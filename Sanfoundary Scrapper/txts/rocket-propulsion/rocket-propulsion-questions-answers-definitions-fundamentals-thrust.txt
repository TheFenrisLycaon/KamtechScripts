1. If the exit pressure is thrice the atmospheric pressure for a rocket A and if it is twice for rocket B, what will be the ratio of pressure thrust of rocket A to that of B?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
Pe = 3Pa for rocket A
Pe = 2Pa for rocket B
Pressure thrust Tp = (Pe-Pa)Ae
So TpA/TpB = 2Pa/Pa
= 2.
2. In the expression of pressure thrust, what does the area (A) represent?
a) The cross-sectional area of the throat
b) The total surface area of the rocket casing
c) The cross-sectional area of the nozzle exit
d) The total surface area of the combustion chamber
c
3. If Pe represents exit pressure and Pa represents the atmospheric pressure, what is the condition for a nozzle to be overexpanded?
a) Pe < Pa
b) Pe > Pa
c) Pe = Pa
d) Pe = 0.5*Pa
a
4. What will happen to thrust and specific impulse as the rocket is propelled to higher altitudes?
a) Thrust decreases, specific impulse increases
b) Thrust increases, specific impulse increases
c) Thrust decreases, specific impulse decreases
d) Thrust increases, specific impulse decreases
b
5. The rocket nozzle is usually so designed such that the exhaust pressure is ____ the ambient fluid pressure.
a) greater than
b) less than
c) equal to
d) equal to or slightly higher than
d

6. How does the total thrust vary with an extendable nozzle?
a) First increases, then decrease
b) First decreases, then increase
c) Keeps on increasing
d) Keeps on decreasing
a
7. A rocket has a throat area of 10 mm2 and nozzle exit area of 25 mm2. If the mass flow rate of its propellants is 2 kg/s, exit velocity is 30 m/s, and if exit pressure is twice the standard atmospheric pressure at sea level, what will be the total thrust?
a) 60 N
b) 62.53 N
c) 61.26 N
d) 65.06 N
b
Momentum thrust = 2*30 = 60 N
Pressure thrust = (Pe-Pa)*Ae = 101325*25/1000000 = 2.53 N
Total thrust = 60 + 2.53 = 62.53 N.
8. Rocket A has twice the pressure thrust of rocket B while it has half the momentum thrust as that of B. If the momentum thrust of B is 5 times its pressure thrust, find the ratio of total thrust of A to B.
a) 0.5
b) 0.75
c) 1
d) 0.25
b
9. Consider a rocket engine A and a jet engine B. Which of them will have higher specific impulse?
a) A
b) B
c) B doesn’t have a specific impulse
d) A doesn’t have a specific impulse
b
10. If exhaust pressure is Pe and surrounding fluid pressure is Pa, what is the condition for the optimum expansion ratio of a rocket nozzle?
a) Pe=Pa
b) Pe<Pa
c) Pe>Pa
d) Pe=0.5*Pa
