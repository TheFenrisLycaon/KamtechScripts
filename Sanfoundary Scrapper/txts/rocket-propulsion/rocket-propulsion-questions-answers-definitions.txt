a) 500 to 1700 °C
b) 1700 to 2500 °C
c) 2500 to 4100 °C
d) 4100 to 6900 °C
c
4. Which of the following pressure feed systems is mostly used in attitude control of liquid propellant rocket engine with more than one thrust chamber per engine?
a) The Gas pressure feed system
b) Pump-fed system
c) Gravity assisted feed system
d) No feed system is used
a
5. What is the typical liquid propellant feed system used in space launch vehicles?
a) The Gas pressure feed system
b) Pump-fed system
c) Gravity assisted feed system
d) No feed system is used
b
6. For a constant thrust of 6000 N, find the total impulse for the burning time of 3s.
a) 36000 Ns
b) 18000 Ns
c) 9000 Ns
d) 0 Ns
b
It = 6000 x 3 = 18000 Ns
7. Suppose the thrust force of a rocket varies with time t as F = 250(3t2 + 2t). Then find out the total impulse for a burn duration of 4s.
a) 10000 Ns
b) 20000 Ns
c) 40000 Ns
d) 80000 Ns
b
It = 250 x (tb3 + tb2) = 250 x (64 + 16) = 20,000 Ns.
8. For a rocket, the specific impulse was found to be 250s. Given that the thrust force is constant and assuming gravity-free and drag-free conditions, what will the thrust force be for a mass flow rate of the form (4t2-3t) kg/s and a burn duration of 3s?
a) 18375 N
b) 12426 N
c) 25234 N
d) 15595 N
a
Then Isp = Ftb/go(4tb3/3 – 3tb2/2).
Using tb = 3s, Isp = 250s, go = 9.8 m/s2,
F = 250 x 9.8 x 22.5/3 = 18375 N.
9. Given that the total impulse is 25000 Ns and specific impulse is 300s, find out the effective propellant mass for a burn duration of 8s.
a) 17 kg
b) 8.5 kg
c) 34 kg
d) 68 kg
b
Using  Isp = It/mpgo, with go = 9.8 m/s2.
mp = 25000 / (9.8 x 300) = 8.5 kg.
10. Consider two rocket engines A and B with A having a specific impulse of 242s and B having a specific impulse of 150s. What can be said about their efficiency?
a) Both A and B are equally efficient
b) A is more efficient than B
c) B is more efficient than A
d) Efficiency doesn’t depend on specific impulse
b
