6. Which of the following is acceleration perpendicular to the flight path?
a) udθ/dt
b) θdu/dt
c) d(uθ)/dt
d) d(u/θ)/dt
a
7. Determine the acceleration perpendicular to flight path for constant value of flight speed u = 100 m/s and instantaneous radius R = 200 m.
a) 100 m/s2
b) 50 m/s2
c) 200 m/s2
d) 125 m/s2
b
atan = 1002/200 = 50 m/s2.
8. Determine the component of gravitational force in the direction of the flight path if the angle of the flight path with the horizontal is 30°, angle of direction of thrust with the horizontal is 20° and mass of the vehicle is 300 kg. Assume the acceleration due to gravity to be 9.8 m/s2.
a) 2250 N
b) 2980 N
c) 1470 N
d) 3343 N
c
Fgrav comp = 300 x 9.8 x sin(30) = 1470 N.
9. For a propulsive force of 1500 N, determine the magnitude of its component in a direction normal to the flight velocity if the angle of flight path with the horizontal is 30° and the angle of direction of thrust with the horizontal is 10°. Assume g=9.8 m/s2.
a) 513 N
b) 1026 N
c) 279 N
d) 813 N
a
Tprop = 1500 x sin(10-30) = 513 N in magnitude.
10. If the flight is not following a vertical path, then the gravity losses are a function of the angle between the flight direction and the local horizontal.
a) True
b) False
a
