1. Stability of a flying vehicle cannot be ensured by __________
a) control surfaces
b) reaction control system
c) anti-sloshing setup
d) hinged multiple rocket nozzles
c
2. Suppose an aircraft trimmed at a 10° angle of attack faces a gust that changes the angle of attack to 15°. What is the nature of the moment required to bring it back to the trimmed condition?
a) Positive pitching moment
b) Positive yawing moment
c) Negative pitching moment
d) Negative yawing moment
c
3. Which of the following statements is true for the center of gravity (cog) and the center of pressure (cop) location along the axis of a fuel powered aircraft?
a) cog and cop both changes
b) cog remains fixed but cop changes
c) cog and cop both remain fixed
d) cog changes but cop remains fixed
a
4. Which of the following can be spin-stabilized?
a) Unguided rocket projectiles
b) Commercial aircrafts
c) Artificial satellites
d) Bullet trains
a
5. Determine the period of revolution of an artificial satellite in a circular orbit of altitude 350 km.
a) 1.738 hrs
b) 1.266 hrs
c) 1.395 hrs
d) 1.525 hrs
d
= 2×3.14x(6728000)3/2/(3.986×1014)
= 1.525 hrs.

6. For a satellite revolving around the earth in a circular orbit at an altitude of 350 km, determine the orbital velocity.
a) 7691.3 m/s
b) 7606.9 m/s
c) 7532.3 m/s
d) 7797.2 m/s
a
V = \(\sqrt{(3.98 * 10^{14}/6728000)}\) 
= 7691.3 m/s.
7. For some type of flying vehicle applications, a low-speed roll is given to avoid thrust vector deviations.
a) True
b) False
a
8. For an airplane undergoing a steady pull-up maneuver along a curved flight path of the constant angle of attack, constant pitch rate of 20°/s, and having a radius of curvature of 150 m, determine the flight velocity.
a) 47.66 m/s
b) 52.36 m/s
c) 38.33 m/s
d) 69.42 m/s
b
Then, V = qR = 20 x π/180 x 150 = 52.36 m/s.
9. The point on the rocket where all the aerodynamic forces balance is called as the ______________
a) center of pressure
b) neutral point
c) maneuvering point
d) center of gravity
a
10. Determine the normal force coefficient of a rocket having a maximum frontal area of 0.2 m2, flying at sea level with a velocity of 100 m/s. Consider the center of gravity to be ahead of the center of pressure by 0.5 m and the corrective moment coefficient to be 2.5.
a) 0.016
b) 0.012
c) 0.008
d) 0.004
d
Then Cna = 2.5/(0.5×1.225×1002x0.2×0.5) = 0.004.
