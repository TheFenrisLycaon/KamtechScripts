1. Depending on the mission profile, the most economical number of steps / expended stages for a multistage rocket is between _____ and ______
a) 2, 10
b) 4, 9
c) 2, 6
d) 4, 7
c
2. If the velocity increments of the first, second, and third stages are 1000 m/s, 500 m/s and 250 m/s respectively, determine the total velocity increment.
a) 2750 m/s
b) 1375 m/s
c) 1750 m/s
d) 3500 m/s
c
3. Determine the mass ratio (Initial mass/Burnout mass) for each stage for a 3-stage rocket, given the total velocity increment is 2000 m/s, mass ratio is constant for all stages and the exhaust velocity is constant for all stages with a value of 3000 m/s.
a) 2.51
b) 1.52
c) 2.15
d) 1.25
d
= 3 c ln (R), since c1 = c2 = c3 = c and R1 = R2 = R3 = R
⇒ R = exp (δuf/3c)
= exp(2000 / 9000) = 1.25.
4. Strap-on booster stages are an example of ______ staging.
a) parallel
b) tandem
c) partial
d) piggyback
a
5. If the theoretical payload increases by the use of a third stage for an initially two stage rockets is 8-10%, which of the following values is a logical value for theoretical payload increase for the use of an additional fourth stage?
a) -4 to -6%
b) 3 to 5%
c) 8 to 10%
d) 12 to 14%
b
6. Usually, the thrusts required by a rocket system __________ from upper to lower stages.
a) increases
b) decreases
c) first increases and then decreases
d) first decreases and then increases
b
7. Which of the following terms are not related to a strap-on stage of a rocket engine?
a) Booster stage
b) Half stage
c) Zero stage
d) Sustainer stage
d
8. Which of the following operations does the small reaction control thrusters in Space Shuttle doesn’t serve?
a) Attitude control
b) Small trajectory corrections
c) Docking
d) Take-off
d
9. __________ is that part of a launch vehicle that carries the payload.
a) Spacecraft
b) Booster stage
c) Sustainer stage
d) Control and guidance system
a
10. Payload carrying capacity decreases with the altitude achieved by the rocket.
a) True
b) False
a
