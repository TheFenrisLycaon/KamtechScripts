1. Which of the following will happen if there is a flow obstruction in the nozzle inner wall?
a) Local conversion of kinetic to thermal energy
b) Local drop in pressure around the region of obstruction
c) Formation of normal shock waves at the point of obstruction
d) Rapid decrease in mass flow rate
a
2. If at a  point along the isentropic rocket nozzle, the temperature of the gas is 718 K, and the flow velocity is 150 m/s, determine the nozzle exit velocity, given the exhaust gas temperature is 460 K (Assume Cp = 1005 J/kg K)
a) 840.25 m/s
b) 735.58 m/s
c) 913.07 m/s
d) 374.95 m/s
b
ho = h + v2/2 = const.
Then, h1 + v12/2 = he + ve2/2
Writing h = CpT, we have
ve = \(\sqrt{(2C_p(T_1-T_e) +v_1^2)}\) 
= 735.58 m/s.
3. If the rocket exhaust gases are calorically perfect and have a mean molecular mass of 28 kg/kmol, and a constant specific heat ratio (γ) of 1.33, determine the nozzle exit velocity. Assume the nozzle inlet conditions to be the following: P1 = 5 MPa, V1 = 240 m/s, T1 = 750 K and exit pressure (Pe) to be 1 MPa.
a) 204 m/s
b) 699.21 m/s
c) 712.32 m/s
d) 805.56 m/s
d
Te = T1(Pe / P1)γ/γ-1
Te = 750 x (1/5)0.33/1.33 = 503 K
R = Ru / Mmol = 8314/28 = 297 J / kg K.
Cp = γR/(γ-1) = 1.33 x 297 / 0.33 = 1197 J / kg K.
ho is constant. So, h1 + v12/2 = he + ve2/2.
Using this, ve = \(\sqrt{(2C_p(T_1-T_e) +v_1^2)}\) 
= \(\sqrt{(2*1197*( 750 – 503) + 240^2)}\) 
= 805.56 m/s.
