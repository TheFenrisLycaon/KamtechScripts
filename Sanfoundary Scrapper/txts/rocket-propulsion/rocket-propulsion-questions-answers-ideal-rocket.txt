1. For an ideal rocket, what should be the nature of the working substance?
a) Homogeneous
b) Heterogeneous
c) Anisotropic
d) Amorphous
a
2. What is the allowable amount of heat (in % of total available energy) that can be transferred across the walls of an ideal rocket?
a) 0%
b) 10%
c) 15%
d) 5%
a
3. An ideal rocket has a chamber pressure of 1 MPa and a temperature of 1600 K. Determine the density of the combustion product if its molecular mass is 24 kg/kmol.
a) 1.2 kg/m3
b) 2.4 kg/m3
c) 1.8 kg/m3
d) 3.6 kg/m3
c
R = Ru / Mmol = 8314 / 24 = 346.42 J kg-1K-1
ρ = P/RT = 1 x 106 / (346.42 x 1600)
= 1.8 kg/m3.
4. Which of the following statements is correct for an ideal rocket?
a) All kinds of frictional effects are not present, but the boundary layer cannot be neglected
b) All discontinuities are not present, but shock waves are allowable
c) Propellant flow is steady but constant
d) The expansion of the working fluid is steady, but need not be uniform
c
5. Select the correct option for an ideal rocket engine.
a) The exhaust gases leaving the rocket need not be axially directed
b) Across any cross-section normal to the nozzle axis, gas velocity need not be uniform
c) The gas composition can vary across the nozzle
d) Cryogenic propellants need to be stored at their boiling points
d
6. Which of the following relations won’t hold in an ideal rocket engine’s nozzle?
a) Isentropic expansion relations
b) Conductive heat transfer relations
c) Homogeneous flow relations
d) Ideal gas law relations
b
7. For typical real rocket engines, what is the approximate amount of energy lost (from the available energy pool) due to heat transfer to the walls of the rocket?
a) 1%
b) 10%
c) 5%
d) 15%
a
8. Which of the following is a reasonable depiction of the mass distribution in practical chemical rockets?
a) 50% propellants, 50% inert mass
b) 10% propellants 90% inert mass
c) 90% propellants 10% inert mass
d) 40% propellants 60% inert mass
c
9. Find the propellant mass fraction for a rocket having a structural mass of 150 kg, a payload mass of 20 kg and propellant mass of 1000 kg.
a) 0.65
b) 0.85
c) 0.95
d) 0.45
b
Minert = Mstruct + Mpayload = 150 + 20 = 170 kg
Minitial = Minert + Mprop = 170 + 1000 = 1170 kg
Propellant mass fraction η = Mprop / Minitial = 1000/1170 ≈ 0.85.
10. Which of the following is not a feature of the combustion chamber in an ideal chemical rocket engine?
a) High pressure
b) High temperature
c) Low flow velocity
d) Higher transient time
d
