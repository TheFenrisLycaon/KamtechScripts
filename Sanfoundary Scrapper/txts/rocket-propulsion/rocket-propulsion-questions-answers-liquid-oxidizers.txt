1. __________ are not liquid oxidizers.
a) Nitrogen-fluorine formulations
b) Oxygen-fluorine compounds
c) Fluorinated hydrocarbons
d) Borohydrides
d
2. ___________ is a commonly used liquid oxidizer.
a) ClF3
b) OF2
c) ClF5
d) H2O2
d
3. LOX boils at _______ atmospheric pressure.
a) 909C
b) 90 K
c) 90 F
d) 90 R
b
4. Which of the following is the specific gravity and heat of vaporization of LOX at atmospheric pressure?
a) 1.14; 213 kJ/kg
b) 1.08; 253 kJ/kg
c) 1.80; 235 kJ/kg
d) 1.41; 231 kJ/kg
a
5. What is the decrease in specific gravity of LOX if the tank pressure is increased from atmospheric pressure to 8 atm? (At 8 atm, specific gravity of LOX is 0.88)
a) 32.3%
b) 28.2 %
c) 22.8%
d) 25.3%
c
δinc=(0.88-1.14)/1.14 x 100 = -22.8. Hence the decrease is 22.8%.

a
8. In the combustion chamber, hydrogen peroxide decomposes to give __________
a) hydrogen and oxygen
b) hydrogen and water
c) oxygen and water
d) water
c
The reaction is represented as H2O2 → H2O + 1/2O2 + heat.
9. Which of the following is not a catalyst used for H2O2 decomposition?
a) Platinum
b) Iron oxide
c) Manganese dioxide
d) Aluminium
d
10. Theoretical specific impulse of 90% H2O2 is _______
a) 204 s
b) 154 s
c) 321 s
