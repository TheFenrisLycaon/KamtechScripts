1. The oxidiser flow (mo) through the gas generator is ____________ if its flow rate through the pump is 10 kg/s and through the thrust chamber is 5 kg/s.
a) 5 kg/s
b) 15 kg/s
c) 20 kg/s
d) 25 kg/s
a
So, (mo)gg = 10 – 5 = 5 kg/s.
2. The fuel flow (mf) through the gas generator is ____________ if its flow rate through the pump is 18 kg/s and through the thrust chamber is 10 kg/s.
a) 18 kg/s
b) 10 kg/s
c) 8 kg/s
d) 28 kg/s
c
So, (mf)gg = 18 – 10 = 8 kg/s.
3. What is the total mass flow rate through the gas generator if the oxidizer flow through it is 15 kg/s and fuel flow is 18 kg/s?
a) 3 kg/s
b) 48 kg/s
c) 53 kg/s
d) 33 kg/s
d
mgg = 15 + 18 = 33 kg/s.
4. In a turbopump, what are are the gear ratios for ao and af (for oxidizer pump and fuel pump respectively) if no gears are used?
a) 0 for both
b) 1 for both
c) 0 for ao and 1 for af
d) 0 for af and 1 for ao
b
5. If the gear ratio for fuel pump is thrice that of the oxidizer pump, the shaft speed of fuel pump is ____________ the oxidizer pump.
a) half
b) twice
c) thrice
d) one-third
d
Given, af=3 x ao.
Using this, Nf = 1/3 x No.

6. If power of turbines equals PT, power consumed by pumps is PP and the power consumed by auxiliaries is PA, what is the expression for auxiliary power?
a) PA = PP – PT
b) PA = PP + PT
c) PA = PT – PP
d) PA = PT x PP
c
7. The power is expressed as the product of torque and ____________
a) vehicle speed
b) shaft speed
c) exhaust velocity
d) volume flow rate per unit cross-sectional area
b
8. Which of the following expressions is true when there are no gears in a particular turbopump?
a) NT = No ≠ Nf
b) NT ≠ No = Nf
c) NT ≠ No ≠ Nf
d) NT = No = Nf
d
9. If L represents torque, and the subscripts T, o, f, b denotes the turbopump, oxidizer pump, fuel pump and bearings respectively, then which of the following expressions is true when there are no gears in a particular turbopump?
a) LT = Lo + Lf + Lb
b) LT = Lo x Lf x Lb
c) LT = Lo = Lf = Lb
d) LT = Lo = Lf ≠ Lb
a
10. If the pressure rise ΔP across a pump is half the discharge pressure, then which of the following relates the suction pressure Ps to discharge pressure pd?
a) Ps = pd
b) Ps = 2 x Pd
c) 2 x Ps = Pd
d) Ps = 4 x Pd
c
Since ΔP = 1/2 Pd, Pd = 2Ps.
