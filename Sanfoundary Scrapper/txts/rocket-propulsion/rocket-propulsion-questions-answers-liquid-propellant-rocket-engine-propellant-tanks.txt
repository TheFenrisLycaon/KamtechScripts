1. Which of the following materials of the propellant tank requires a thin inner liner of metal to avoid leakage?
a) Titanium
b) Aluminum
c) Stainless steel
d) Fiber-reinforced plastics
d
2. What is ullage?
a) The volume of propellant stored inside a tank neglecting its empty volume
b) The extra volume of gas above the propellant in a tank
c) The ratio of the volume of extra gas to that of the propellant after 50% of the propellant has been consumed
d) The ratio of the volume of the propellant to that of the extra gas after 50% of the propellant has been consumed
b
3. Determine the amount of propellant trapped in pipe, fittings, and valve corners and lost by other means, if the initial mass of the propellant was M and it had an expulsion efficiency of 97%.
a) 0.97M
b) 0.03M
c) 0.06M
d) 0.48M
b
So, 0.97 = mexpel/M
Then mtrapped = M – Mexpel = 0.03M.
4. What happens to the vehicle mass ratio (Initial mass / Burnout mass) when the residual propellant is not available for combustion?
a) Decreases slightly
b) Increases slightly
c) Increases rapidly
d) Decreases rapidly
a
5. A good propellant tank must ensure that sloshing is ___________ and vortexing is ____________
a) minimized; maximized
b) maximized; minimized
c) maximized; maximized
d) minimized; minimized
d
6. When does the slosh-dynamics problem become useful?
a) When the liquid has a free surface
b) When the liquid has no free surface
c) When the liquid is non-Newtonian
d) When the material stored inside the tank is thixotropic
a
7. Who is the innovative rocket designer who created Atlas ICBM?
a) Stewart Powell
b) Karel Bossart
c) John von Neumann
d) Bernard A. Schriever
b
8. Which component of the external tank of Space Shuttle served the main purpose of distributing thrust loads from SRBs?
a) LOX tank
b) LH2 tank
c) Intertank
d) Contractor
c
