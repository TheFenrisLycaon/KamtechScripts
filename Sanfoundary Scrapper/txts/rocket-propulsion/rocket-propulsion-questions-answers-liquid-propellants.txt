1. What kind of propulsion is used for trajectory adjustments and attitude corrections?
a) Boosting propulsion
b) Auxiliary propulsion
c) Sustaining propulsion
d) Cryogenic propulsion
b
2. How are liquid rocket engines classified on the basis of their feed system?
a) Pressurized or turbopump
b) Restartable or single fired
c) Single flight or reusable
d) Boosting or auxiliary
a
3. The thruster is also called as _____________
a) combustion chamber
b) thrust chamber
c) nozzle
d) injector
b
4. Which of the following ways of thrust chamber cooling may use niobium metal?
a) Film cooling
b) Cooling jacket
c) Radiation cooling
d) Ablative cooling
c
5. At what temperature are the liquid oxygen and the liquid hydrogen kept in their storage tanks of the cryogenic rocket engine?
a) -253°C and -183°C
b) -183°C and -253°C
c) -253°C for both
d) -183°C for both
b
6. Determine the mixture ratio if mass flow rate of the oxidizer is 3/4 times the total mass flow rate of the combustion products.
a) 2.5
b) 3
c) 2
d) 1
b
mo = 3/4 mcomb
So, mf = 1/4 mcomb
Mixture ratio r = mo / mf = 3.
7. If the total propellant flow rate is 24 kg/s and the mixture ratio is 2.3, determine the mass flow rate of the oxidizer.
a) 19.67 kg/s
b) 15.33 kg/s
c) 12.94 kg/s
d) 16.73 kg/s
d
= 2.3 x 24/(3.3) = 16.73 kg/s.
