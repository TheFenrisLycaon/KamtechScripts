1. For a rocket with an initial mass of 15,000 kg and carrying a payload of 1000 kg, determine the velocity change if it was ground launched and has an equivalent exhaust velocity of 3000 m/s. Assume the structural mass coefficient to be 0.24.
a) 3533 m/s
b) 3967 m/s
c) 3706 m/s
d) 4295 m/s
c
∆V = Ueqln((1+λ)/(ε+λ))
= 3000 x ln(1.0714/0.3114)
= 3706 m/s.
2. If δ denotes inert mass fraction and λ denotes the payload fraction, what is the formula for parametric mass ratio (r)?
a) r = δ/λ
b) r = λ/δ
c) r = λ – δ
d) r = λ + δ
d
