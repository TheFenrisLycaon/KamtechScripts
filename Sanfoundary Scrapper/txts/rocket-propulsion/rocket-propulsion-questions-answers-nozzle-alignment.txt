1. What will happen when the thrust line doesn’t intersect the center of mass of a flying vehicle?
a) The vehicle experiences a centripetal acceleration
b) The vehicle drops in altitude
c) The vehicle trajectory becomes zigzag
d) The vehicle tries to rotate in flight
d
2. Which among the following is the most necessary for controlled turning and attitude control?
a) Turning moments
b) High exhaust velocity
c) Vortex generators
d) Dorsal fins
a
3. What will not help in generating a turning moment in a flying vehicle?
a) Thrust vector deflection
b) Aerodynamic fins
c) Using separate engines for attitude control
d) Altering the nozzle exit area by using nozzle extensions
d
4. In general, the rocket nozzle exits surface’s geometric axis is taken to be the __________
a) gimbal axis
b) roll axis
c) thrust axis
d) lift axis
c
5. Which of the following doesn’t belong to misalignment due to irregularities in nozzle geometry?
a) Out of round
b) Unsymmetrical roughness
c) Protuberances
d) Nozzle extensions
d
6. If the nozzle exit is flush with the missile skin, then the nozzle scarf angle and cant angle is the same.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Conventional axisymmetric conical nozzle with a cylindrical extension is called as ______
a) cant nozzle
b) bell-shaped nozzle
c) scarfed nozzle
d) aerospike nozzle
c
8. Motor axial specific impulse _____ with the scarf angle.
a) increases
b) decreases
c) increases and then decreases
d) decreases and then increases
b
9. For a scarfed nozzle, thrust coefficient, thrust and specific impulse are a function of ambient pressure.
a) True
b) False
b
10. If the motor axial specific impulse of a given nozzle is 340s for propellant ‘A’ and its characteristic velocity is 1400 m/s, determine the specific impulse for the same nozzle using a propellant ‘B’ with a characteristic velocity of 980 m/s. Assume both propellants ‘A’ and ‘B’  have the same specific heat ratio.
a) 259 s
b) 286 s
c) 277 s
d) 238 s
d
= 340 x 980 / 1400 = 238 s.
