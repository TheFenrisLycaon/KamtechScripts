d) Minimize flow velocity
d
2. Which of the following is permissible in a rocket nozzle?

b) Smooth edges
c) Holes
d) Protrusions
b
3. Which of the following is not an objective of a good nozzle configuration?

a
Here, α = 20/2 = 10°

= 0.992.

c) Pressure thrust
d) Pressure ratio
b
7. Which of the following is a typical optimum divergence angle for a conical nozzle?
a) 10°
b) 30°
c) 40°
d) 60°
b
8. How does the divergence angle vary along a bell-shaped nozzle?
a) Sharply increases, then decrease
b) Sharply decreases, then increase
c) Remains constant for a while and then increases
d) Remains constant for a while and then decreases
a
9. Which of the following is not a reason why large divergence angles are allowed in bell-shaped nozzles immediately behind the throat?
a) High relative pressure
b) Large pressure gradient
c) Rapid expansion of the working fluid
d) Supersonic flow
d
10. What is the difference between the angle at the nozzle inflection point and the angle at the exit called?
a) Contour angle
b) Divergence angle
c) Semi-divergence angle
d) Turn-back angle
d
11. If the divergence angle for a conical nozzle is 30°, nozzle exit diameter is 30 cm, exit pressure is 10% more than the ambient pressure, mass flow rate is 14 kg/s and the jet exhaust velocity is 700 m/s, determine the total thrust of the engine under standard sea level operating conditions.
a) 11.2 kN
b) 12.9 kN
c) 10.3 kN
d) 9.8 kN
c
Ttot = λTmom + Tpres
λ = 1/2 (1 + cosα)
α = 1/2 x 30° = 15°
So, λ = 1/2 (1 + 0.966)
= 0.983
Tpres = (Pe – Pa)Ae
Since the operation is under standard sea level conditions, Pa = 101325 Pa.
Pe = 110% of Pa.
So Pe – Pa = 10% of Pa = 10132.5 Pa
Ae = π de2/4 = 0.071
∴ Tpres = 10132.5 x 0.071 = 719.075 N
Tmom = μe
= 14 x 700 = 9800 N
So Ttot = (0.983 x 9800) + 719.075 ≅ 10.3 kN.
12. If for a bell-shaped nozzle, the divergence angle immediately after the throat is 40°, contour angle at the inflection point is 32° and the nozzle full-angle at its exit is 10°, determine the turn-back angle.
a) 8°
b) 35°
c) 27°
d) 22°
c
θi = contour angle at the inflection point = 32°
θe = 1/2 x full-angle at the exit = 5°
θturn-back = θi – θe
= 32° – 5° = 27°.
