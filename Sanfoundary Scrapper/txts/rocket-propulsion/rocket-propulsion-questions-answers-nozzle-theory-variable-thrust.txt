1. Thrust is a weak function of ______________
a) throat area
b) chamber pressure
c) mass flow rate
d) thrust coefficient
d
2. A two-to-one thrust decrease can be achieved using _________ in a liquid propellant rocket engine.
a) throttle valves
b) gas pressure feed system
c) spark ignitor
d) using BATES grain
a
3. Thrust can be varied by changing the throat area along with throttling the flow.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Attitude and maneuvering corrections require impulses with _________ pulse width.
a) extremely short
b) extremely large
c) moderately short
d) moderately large
a
5. Which of the following is not a way for thrust modulation?
a) Controlling the propellant flow rate to the injector
b) Controlling injection orifices
c) Varying chamber pressure
d) Deploying control surfaces like fins
d
6. Assertion: Oxygen addition in the control flow gases of solid rocket engine will result in a higher characteristic velocity of the exit jet.
Reason: Because of secondary combustion, stagnation temperature and pressure increase. Higher stagnation temperature results in exhaust jet characteristic velocity.
a) Both assertion and reason are correct
b) The assertion is correct but the reason is wrong
c) The assertion is wrong but the reason is correct
d) Both assertion and reason are wrong
a
7. Which of the following thrust modulation technique makes use of symmetric injection for jet area control?
a) Throat Shifting Thrust Modulation
b) Shock Thrust Modulation
c) Shock Vectoring Control
d) Scarfed Nozzle Thrust Modulation
a
8. Which of the following thrust modulation techniques uses a normal shock to reduce total thrust?
a) Throat Shifting Thrust Modulation
b) Scarfed Nozzle Thrust Modulation
c) Shock Thrust Modulation
d) Fluidic Thrust modulation
c
9. For a conical nozzle of throat diameter 0.007 m, exit cross-section diameter 0.02 m, and divergent section length of 0.038 m, determine the nozzle semi-divergence angle.
a) 10.5°
b) 12.6°
c) 7.3°
d) 9.7°
d
∴ α = tan-1(1/2(0.02-0.007)/0.038) = 9.7°.
10. Which of the following cannot be the nature of the actuation system for thrust vector control?
a) Mechanical
b) Fluidic
c) Either mechanical or fluidic
d) Neither mechanical and fluidic
d
