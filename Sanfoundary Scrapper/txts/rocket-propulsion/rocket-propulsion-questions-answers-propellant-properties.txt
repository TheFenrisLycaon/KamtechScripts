b) RP1
c) RDX
d) Aviation gasoline
a
2. Which of the following is not a factor considered in the selection of liquid propellant for a rocket engine?
a) Economic
b) Performance
c) Safety
d) Injector pattern
d
3. Which of the following chemical particles cannot be suspended in liquid fuel to increase specific impulse?
a) Boron
b) Beryllium
c) Aluminium
d) Fluorine
d

6. Which of the following is not a desirable property of a liquid propellant?
a) Low freezing point
b) Low specific gravity
c) Stability
d) High specific heat
b
7. What is the average specific gravity(δav) if the specific gravity of the fuel (δf) is 0.792, the specific gravity of the oxidizer is (δo) is 1.02 and the mixture ratio (r) is 4?
a) 0.96
b) 0.94
c) 1.01
d) 0.98
a
δav = 1.02 x 0.792 x 5/(4×0.792 + 1.02)
= 0.96.
8. Determine the density specific impulse (Id) if the specific impulse is 315 s and the average density of the propellants is 840 kg/m3. Take the reference density to be the maximum density of water.
a) 264.6 s
b 251.3 s
c) 279.5 s
d) 304.4 s
a
∆av = 840/1000 = 0.84, in which consider the density of water to be 1000 kg/m3.
Id = 0.84x 315 = 264.6 s.
9. A good liquid propellant will have ___________
a) easy deterioration
b) resistance to deterioration
c) absorption of moisture
d) small amount of impurities
b
10. Evaporation is a major concern for __________
a) cryogenic propellants
b) monopropellants
c) bipropellants
d) solid propellants
a
