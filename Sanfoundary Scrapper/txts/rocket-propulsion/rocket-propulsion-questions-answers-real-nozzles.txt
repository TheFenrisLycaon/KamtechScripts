1. For an asymmetric nozzle section of diameter 12 cm, determine the average value of flow velocity if the velocity distribution is of the form v2 = (2r – 3r2) x 104 m/s, where r denotes the radial location in the cross-section plane.
a) 1104.4 m/s
b) 765.4 m/s
c) 891.4 m/s
d) 404 m/s
b
A2 = πd22/4
= 0.011 m2
∫v2rdr = ∫ (2r2 – 3r3)x 104 dr
= {(2/3)r23 – (3/4)r24} x 104
r2 = d2/2 = 0.06 m
so V2av = (2π/0.011) x 1.34
= 765.4 m/s.
2. In a boundary layer flow along with the nozzle, why is the layer closest to the wall cooler?
a) Flow velocity is minimum; Low energy flow leads to less temperature
b) Heat transfer to the walls
c) Radial heat propagation from the nozzle axis is a very slow process
d) Mass flow rate closer to the nozzle axis is maximum
b
3. In which of the following cases is the effect of the boundary layer more pronounced?
a) Longer nozzles with high area ratios
b) Shorter nozzles with high area ratios
c) Longer nozzles with low area ratios
d) Shorter nozzles with low area ratios
a
4. What happens to the solid particles in multiphase flow at the nozzle exit when the size of the particles increases?
a) Lower momentum and lower thermal energy
b) Higher momentum and lower thermal energy
c) Lower momentum and higher thermal energy
d) Higher momentum and higher thermal energy
c
5. Which of the following is the correct expression for particle fraction β? Given: Total mass = mT, mass of the particles = mp.
a) mT/mp + mT
b) mp/mp + mT
c) mp/mT
d) mT/mp
c
6. How do the characteristic velocity (c) and the specific impulse (Isp) vary as particle fraction β is increased?
a) Both Isp and c decreases
b) Both Isp and c increases
c) Isp decreases, c increases
d) Isp increases, c decreases
a
7. Which of the following is not correct for transient periods when compared to steady periods of rocket operation?
a) Lower average thrust
b) Higher chamber pressure
c) Lower specific impulse
d) Higher velocity variations
b
8. Which of the following terms denote the ratio of kinetic energy per unit flow of the actual jet leaving the nozzle to that of a hypothetical ideal one with the same working substance, initial state and exit pressure as that of the actual exhaust jet?
a) Velocity correction factor (ζv)
b) Discharge correction factor (ζd)
c) Thrust correlation factor (ζF)
d) Energy efficiency factor (e)
d
9. Determine the velocity correction factor (ζv) if the energy conversion efficiency is 0.94.
a) 0.97
b) 0.85
c) 0.92
d) 0.99
a
So ζv = \(\sqrt{0.94}\) = 0.97 is the final answer.
10. Find the actual mass flow rate for a discharge correction factor (ζd) of 1.15. For an ideal nozzle of same design and initial state, the following information is given: Volume flow rate (Q) = 0.53 m3/s; static temperature (T) = 590 K; static pressure (P) = 0.15 MPa; R = 287 J/kg/K.
a) 0.47
b) 0.88
c) 0.28
d) 0.54
d
For ideal conditions, ρ = P / RT = 0.15 x 106 / (287 x 590) = 0.886 kg/m3.
mi = ρAV = ρQ = 0.886 x 0.53 = 0.47 kg/s.
∴ ma = 1.15 x 0.47 = 0.54 kg/s.
