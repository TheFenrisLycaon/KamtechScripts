1. Determine the propellant mass flow rate for a TSFC of 3200 kg/Ns and a total thrust of 50 kN.
a) 21.65 kg/s
b) 12.56 kg/s
c) 16.52 kg/s
d) 15.62 kg/s
d
Then ṁ = 50,000/3200 = 15.62 kg/s.
2. Find the fuel flow rate for a total propellant flow of 10 kg/s and a mixture ratio of 2.3.
a) 4.71 kg/s
b) 7.41 kg/s
c) 1.47 kg/s
d) 4.17 kg/s
d
So ṁf = 10/2.4 = 4.17 kg/s.
3. Calculate the flow rate of LOX to the combustion chamber in a LOX-H2 rocket engine if the total propellant flow rate is 17 kg/s and mixture ratio is 3.2.
a) 11.33 kg/s
b) 15.92 kg/s
c) 12.95 kg/s
d) 13.67 kg/s
c
So ṁo = 17*3.2/4.2 = 12.95 kg/s.
4. Determine the nozzle throat area for a rocket engine producing a total thrust of 10 kN, chamber pressure of 5.2 MPa and thrust coefficient of 1.9.
a) 10.12 cm2
b) 12.10 cm2
c) 11.20 cm2
d) 21.10 cm2
a
Then At = 10000/(5.2 x 106 x 1.9)
= 10.12 cm2.
5. If the semi-divergence angle of a conical nozzle is 15°, throat diameter is 8.326 cm and exit area is 0.54 m2, determine the nozzle length.
a) 139.2 cm
b) 239.1 cm
c) 312.9 cm
d) 231.9 cm
a
Exit diameter D2 = √(4*Ae/π), where Ae is the exit area.
Then D2 = 82.92 cm
So, L = (82.92 – 8.326)/0.536 = 139.2 cm.
6. The pressure drop across injector is usually set between _________ of the chamber pressure.
a) 45 and 65%
b) 30 and 45%
c) 15 and 25%
d) 5 and 15%
c
7. Which of the following is a realistic value of the discharge coefficient?
a) 0.5
b) 1.5
c) 5.5
d) 10.5
a
8. In which of the following ignition techniques does the system use a solid propellant squib or grain of few seconds of burning duration?
a) Spark plug ignition
b) Pyrotechnic ignition
c) Ignition by electrically heated wires
d) Precombustion chamber ignition
b
9. Which of the following is the correct expression for energy radiated by a body (Assume ε to be emissivity, A to be surface area, T to be temperature, f to be geometric factor)
a) E = (1/f)εσAT4
b) E = fεσAT4
c) E = (1/f)εσAT2
d) E = fεσAT2
b
10. Which of the following gases show a strong emission band in the region of radiant heat transfer?
a) Ammonia
b) Hydrogen
c) Oxygen
d) Nitrogen
a
