1. Determine the velocity of a satellite in a circular orbit around the earth at a height of 112 km.
a) 3219.28 m/s
b) 2472.76 m/s
c) 1591.98 m/s
d) 7834.95 m/s
d
⇒ us = Ro√(go/Ro+h)
⇒ us = 6374 x 103 x √(9.8/6486000) = 7834.95 m/s.
2. Determine the time period of revolution of a satellite in a circular orbit around a planet of radius 6374 m at a height of 600 m. Assume the acceleration due to gravity at sea level to be 9.8 m/s2.
a) 30 mins
b) 25 mins
c) 35 mins
d) 40 mins
a
⇒ τ = 2 x 3.14 x 69743/2/(6374/√9.8) = 1797.2 s or ∼ 30 mins.
3. Determine the energy necessary to bring a unit mass into a circular orbit around the earth having a height of 170 km. Neglect the effects of drag.
a) 25 MJ
b) 16 MJ
c) 32 MJ
d) 19 MJ
c
⇒ E = 0.5 x 6374 x 103 x 9.8 x (6714/6544) ≅ 32 MJ.
4. What is the typical altitude of LEO?
a) more than 500 km
b) Less than 800 km
c) Less than 500 km
d) More than 800 km
c
5. Why are the orbits of satellites outside of the earth’s atmosphere?
a) The orbit needs to be elliptical
b) The orbit needs to be circular
c) Within the atmosphere, the satellite spirals down to the earth
d) Drag losses are absent outside the atmosphere
d
6. For a circular trajectory of a satellite around the earth, the centrifugal forces must balance the ______
a) propulsive forces
b) gravitational forces
c) lift forces
d) drag forces
b
7. Find the altitude of a satellite in a circular orbit around earth with a velocity of 7000 m/s.
a) 1751.6 km
b) 2134.3 km
c) 9053.1 km
d) 899.5 km
a
h = [go/us2/Ro2] – Ro
h = 1751.6 km.
8. At an instant of time, a satellite in an elliptical orbit is at a distance of 500 km from the surface of the earth. If the semi major axis of the orbit is 8500 km in length, determine the magnitude of the satellite velocity. Take μ = 3.986 x 1014 m3/sec2.
a) 8118.33 m/s
b) 8813.38 m/s
c) 8311.38 m/s
d) 8181.38 m/s
c
u = [3.986 x 1014 x(2/6874000 – 1/8500000)]1/2
= 8311.38 m/s.
9. Satellite velocity is maximum at __________ for an elliptical orbit.
a) apogee
b) perigee
c) focal point
d) infinity
b
10. For an eccentricity of 0.92 and semi major axis length of 9500 km, determine the apogee velocity for a satellite in elliptical orbit. Take μ = 3.986 x 1014 m3/sec2.
a) 1349.54 m/s
b) 1439.45 m/s
c) 1233.33 m/s
d) 1322.21 m/s
d
ua = √(3.986 x 1014 x (0.08/1.92)/(9500 x 103)) = 1322.21 m/s.
