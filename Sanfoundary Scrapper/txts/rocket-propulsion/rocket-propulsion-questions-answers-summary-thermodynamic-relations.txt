1. Which of the following comprises of internal thermal energy and flow work?
a) Entropy
b) Enthalpy
c) Kinetic energy
d) Potential energy
b
2. In which of the following cases can enthalpy be expressed as a function of constant Cp and absolute temperature T?
a) Ideal gas
b) Calorically perfect gas
c) Real gas
d) Thermally perfect gas
b
3. Find the stagnation enthalpy of a calorically perfect gas having a flow velocity of 94 m/s and static temperature of 315 K. (Cp=1005 J/kg/K)
a) 321 kJ/kg
b) 234 kJ/kg
c) 456 kJ/kg
d) 543 kJ/kg
a
h = Cp T
= 1005 x 315
= 316,575 J/kg
Then using the relation h0 = h + v2/2,
h0 = 316,575 + 4324.5
≅ 321 kJ/kg.
4. For an incompressible subsonic flow over a nozzle, at a typical location A along the nozzle, the diameter of the cross-section was found to be 30 cm. What will be the diameter of the cross section at a point B where the flow velocity was determined to be twice the value at A?
a) 21.21 cm
b) 42.42 cm
c) 15 cm
d) 60 cm
a
A1V1 = A2 V2
Given V2 = 2 V1
d22/4 = (d12/4) V1/V2
⇒ d2 = d1 √0.5
= 21.21 cm.
5. For an isentropic flow along a nozzle, at location A, the static temperature and pressure were measured to be 320 K and 5 bar. What will be the static pressure at the location where the static temperature is 500 K? (Given η = 1.4)
a) 23.8 bar
b) 32.4 bar
c) 12.4 bar
d) 7.4 bar
a
Then using P1/P2 = (T1/T2)(η/η-1)
P2 = 5 x (500/320)1.4/0.4
≅23.8 bar.

6. An isentropic flow at section x has a velocity of 200 m/s and static enthalpy of 360 kJ/kg. Determine the flow velocity at a location y where the static enthalpy is half the value at x.
a) 447.2 m/s
b) 385.9 m/s
c) 515.4 m/s
d) 408.2 m/s
a
Stagnation enthalpy  h0 = h + v2/2 is constant.
So h1 + v12/2 = h2 + v22/2
v2 = √2(360,000 – 180000 + 40000/2)
= 447.2 m/s.
7. Which of the following is not a unit of gas constant?
a) J/(mol.K)
b) kcal/(K.mol)
c) m3atm/(K.mol)
d) amu.m2s2/K
d
8. For an isentropic flow of air through a pipe from a large chamber having a pressure of 5 MPa and temperature of 290 K, determine the temperature at a point along the length of the pipe where the pressure is 3 MPa.
a) 250 K
b) 277 K
c) 219 K
d) 300 K
a
T = (3/5)0.4/1.4 x 290
≅250 K.
9. Which of the following doesn’t happen during a subsonic and isentropic nozzle expansion?
a) Increase in the specific volume
b) Decrease in absolute fluid static temperature
c) Decrease in static pressure
d) Decrease in stagnation temperature
d
10. Acoustic velocity in ideal gases is independent of _____________
a) nature of the gas
b) gas temperature
c) gas pressure
d) the molecular mass of the gas
c
