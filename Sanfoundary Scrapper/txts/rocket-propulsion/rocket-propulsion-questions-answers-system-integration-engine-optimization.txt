1. Which of the following is not a method of achieving a variable thrust?
a) Injecting liquid into the gas streams before injection
b) Varying injection element area
c) Varying the nozzle throat area
d) Varying feed system pressure drops
a
2. Which of the following can’t happen if a chemical rocket engine were to use gelled propellants?
a) Increase in specific impulse
b) Increase in density impulse
c) Possibility of short-duration pulsing
d) Much less likely to have explosions
a
3. Which of the following will not happen if small aluminum particles are suspended in the fuel or if small inert solid particles are suspended in the oxidizer?
a) Increase in propellant density
b) Reduction in tank and vehicle size
c) Decrease in density impulse
d) Increase in speed and range of atmospheric rockets or missiles
c
4. Propellants that are thick or viscous under static conditions, but flow through valves, injectors, pipes or pumps when adequate shear stress is applied are called __________ propellants.
a) Thixotropic
b) Dilatant
c) Newtonian fluid
d) Non-Newtonian fluid
a
5. For a missile weighing 60 kg cruising with constant velocity 110 m/s, with lift-to-drag ratio of 8 and Isp of 200, determine the range if the final mass of the missile is 25 kg.
a) 119 km
b) 132 km
c) 154 km
d) 198 km
c
R = 110 x 200 x 8 x ln(60/25)
= 154 km.

a) photocell; pyrometer
b) pyrometer; photocell
c) bolometer; pyrometer
d) load cell; pyrometer
a
9. Which of the following doesn’t happen if the starting controls are improperly designed?
a) Accumulation of unburned propellants in the combustion chamber
b) Explosion upon ignition
c) Eventual damage to rocket engine
d) Increase in dripping flow
d
10. Valves are often opened to allow full flow into the combustion chamber.
a) True
b) False
b
