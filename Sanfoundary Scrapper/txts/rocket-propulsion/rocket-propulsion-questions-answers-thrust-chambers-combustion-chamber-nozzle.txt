1. Burning of the propellants take place in __________
a) nozzle
b) injector
c) combustion chamber
d) engine casing
c
2. The volume of the combustion chamber is selected on the basis of which of these factors?
a) Mixing, evaporation and complete combustion of the propellants
b) Mixing and complete combustion of the propellants, but not its evaporation
c) Evaporation and complete combustion of the propellants, but not mixing
d) Mixing and evaporation but not the complete combustion of the propellants
a
3. Which of the following will aid in the selection of smaller combustion chamber volume during its design?
a) Slightly reactive propellants
b) Low chamber pressure
c) Injectors with moderate mixing
d) Possibility for complete combustion
d
4. Which of the following is true for combustion chambers with large volume and diameter?
a) High heat transfer rates to the walls
b) Smaller total area exposed to the heat
c) Thinner walls
d) Lower wall temperature
d
5. The combustion chamber mass is not a function of __________
a) payload mass
b) method of cooling
c) chamber pressure
d) nozzle area ratio
a
6. For increased operating chamber pressure, the length of the combustion chamber ________ and the nozzle throat area _________ if the diameter of the combustion chamber (assume the shape to be cylindrical) is fixed and the thrust remains constant.
a) increases; decreases
b) decreases; increases
c) decreases; decreases
d) increases; increases
c
7. What is characteristic chamber length?
a) Thrust chamber length without the length of the nozzle
b) Length of the thrust chamber as if it were a straight tube with no converging section
c) Total length of the nozzle
d) Total length of the rocket engine
b
L* = Vc/At, where Vc is the chamber volume and At is the throat area.
8. Determine the chamber volume if the characteristic length of a thrust chamber is 150 cm and nozzle throat area is 0.25m2.
a) 0.573 m3
b) 0.735 m3
c) 0.375 m3
d) 0.753 m3
c
So, Vc = 150 x 10-2 x 0.25 = 0.375 m3.
9. Typical values of L* for several bipropellants lie between __________
a) 0.8 and 3 m
b) 1 and 2 m
c) 1.5 and 5.5 m
d) 3.2 and 6.4 m
a
10. What is stay time?
a) Average time spent by each molecule or atom within the combustion chamber volume
b) Average time spent by each molecule or atom within the thrust chamber volume
c) Average time spent by each molecule or atom within the propellant tank after rocket take off
d) Average time spent by each molecule or atom within the injector manifold
a
It is defined by ts = Vc/mVi, where Vc is the chamber volume, m is the mass flow rate, and Vi is the average specific volume.
