1. Consider a mixture of three gases a, b and c at equilibrium. If the individual gas components have pressures equal to Pa, Pb and Pc, determine the total pressure P of the mixture of gases.
a) P = Pa + Pb + Pc
b) P = Pa x Pb x Pc /(Pa + Pb + Pc)
c) P = [(Pa x Pb) + (Pb x Pc) + (Pc x Pa)] / (Pa + Pb + Pc)
d) P = (Pa x Pb / Pc) + (Pb x Pc / Pa) + (Pc x Pa / Pb)
a
2. Perfect gas equation applies very closely to ________ gases.
a) low temperature, low pressure
b) high temperature, high pressure
c) high temperature, low pressure
d) low temperature, high pressure
c
3. Consider two sets of mixture of gases A and B having the same specific volume of the mixture and having total pressures PA and PB respectively. If TA = 3TB and molecular mass of A MA = 1/2 MB, determine the ratio of PA/PB.
a) 0.75
b) 12
c) 1.5
d) 6
d
So PA/PB = (TA/TB) x (MB/MA)
= 3 x 2 = 6.
4. Consider two sets of mixture of gases X and Y having the same total temperature of the mixture and having total pressures PX and PY respectively. If PX = 1.4 PY and molecular mass of A MX = 2.3 x MY, determine the ratio of Vmix_X/Vmix_Y.
a) 0.26
b) 0.52
c) 0.62
d) 0.31
d
PX/PY = (TX/TY) x (MYVmix_Y/MXVmix_X)
Vmix_X/Vmix_Y = (MY/MX) x (TX/TY) x (PY/PX)
= (1/2.3) x 1 x (1/1.4) = 0.31.
5. In a gaseous mixture, the number of moles and the molecular mass (in their respective units) of each component is given as follows: nA = 1, MA = 23; nB = 2, MB = 48; nC = 3, MC = 19. Find the average molecular mass of the mixture.
a) 28.67
b) 29.33
c) 31.25
d) 25.47
b
= (23 + 96 + 57) / 6 = 29.33.

a
7. Determine the stoichiometric mixture mass ratio for the complete reaction: H2 + 1/2 O2 → H2O.

a) Heat of formation
b) Heat of reaction
c) Gibbs free energy
d) Latent heat of vaporization
