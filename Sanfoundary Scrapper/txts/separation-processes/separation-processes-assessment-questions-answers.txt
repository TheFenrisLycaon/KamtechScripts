1.	What is a flash?
a)	It is a single-equilibrium stage distillation where the feed is partially vaporized to give a vapor feed rich in more volatile components.
b)	It is a double-equilibrium stage distillation where the feed is partially vaporized to give a vapor feed rich in more volatile components
c)	It is a single-equilibrium stage distillation where the feed is completely vaporized to give a vapor feed rich in more volatile components
d)	It is a single-equilibrium stage distillation where the feed is partially vaporized to give a vapor feed rich in less volatile components
