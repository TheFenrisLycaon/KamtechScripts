1. What is the goal of distillation?
a) To produce a distillate rich in light key and the bottoms product rich in high key
b) To produce a distillate rich in high key and the bottoms product rich in light key
c) To produce a distillate rich in light key and the bottoms product rich in light key
d) To produce a distillate rich in high key and the bottoms product rich in high key
a
2. What is meant by light key (LK)?
a) A feed that contains less volatile components
b) A feed that has less mass
c) A feed that has higher concentration of less molecular weight solute
d) A feed that contains more volatile components
d
3. What is meant by high key (HK)?
a) A feed that contains less volatile components
b) A feed that has less mass
c) A feed that has higher concentration of less molecular weight solute
d) A feed that contains more volatile components
a
4. If LK=1 and HK=2, what is the formula for α 1,2 ?
a) α 1,2 =K1/K2
b) α 1,2 =K1*K2
c) α 1,2 =K1-K2
d) α 1,2 =K1+K2
a
5. For what value of α1,2 ,the separation cannot be achieved?
a) 0.8
b) 1.2
c) 1.3
d) 1.8
a
than 1.Thus by further increasing pressure, separation cannot be achieved.
