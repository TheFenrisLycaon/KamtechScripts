2.	What is the principle of reverse osmosis?
a)	The direction of solvent flow Can be reversed by applying pressure greater than osmotic pressure
b)	The direction of solvent flow can be reversed by applying pressure less than osmotic pressure
c)	The direction of solvent flow can be reversed by using a permeable membrane
d)	The solvent flow can be reversed by concentrating the mixture
