1.	What happens in a batch mode of contact filtration?
a)	A batch of liquid is contacted with a batch of adsorbent for a period of time → followed by discharge of the slurry from the vessel, and filtration to separate solids from liquid
b)	Liquid and adsorbent are continuously added to and removed from the agitated vessel
c)	liquid is continuously fed, then removed from the vessel, where it is contacted with adsorbent, which is retained in a contacting zone of the vessel until it is nearly spent
d)	Simultaneous continuous and batch mode operated
