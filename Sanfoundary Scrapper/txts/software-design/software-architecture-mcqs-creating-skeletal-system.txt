7. In which of the following ways does a stub stimulate the interactions?
a) The stubs can either produce hard coded canned output or can read the output from a file

d) None of the mentioned
c
8. Which of the following is correct for the skeletal system?

c) All of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned
c
9. Why is having a skeletal system for entire system important?
a) The early creation of a working skeletal version of system and the ability to iteratively refine that version into successively more comprehensive

c) It increases integration time and cost
d) All of the mentioned
c
