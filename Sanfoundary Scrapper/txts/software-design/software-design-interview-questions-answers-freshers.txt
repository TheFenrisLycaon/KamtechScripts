1. Which of the following is true for Adapter pattern?
a) An adapter or wrapper is a component that provides a new interface for an existing component
b) An Adapter or Wrapper pattern is a broker pattern that provides a new interface for existing software so that it can be reused
c) Adaptation for reuse is an old technique that has been used since the beginning of software development
d) All of the mentioned
d
2. The Adapter patterns provide object-oriented adapters in which of theses varieties?
a) One uses inheritance
b) one uses delegation
c) All of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned
c
3. A class (the adapter class) may be given a new interface by an adapter class in which of the two ways?
