a) The Façade pattern is a broker pattern that eases interaction between a client and a sub-system of suppliers

d) All of the mentioned
d
2. Which of the following belongs to iterator pattern?
a) They delegate activities to other portions of the sub-system to which they provide an interface
b) The details of such delegations depend on the sub-system in question
c) The behavior follows the general outline of a broker pattern interaction
d) None of the mentioned
d
3. Which of the following i correct?
a) The Mediator pattern provides a means of increasing coupling
b) In the Mediator pattern, interacts with one another, collaborating objects and with a special mediator class

d) All of the mentioned
c

b) It then controls an interaction with the collaborating colleagues to supply the service
c) If one collaborator needs help from another, it notifies the Mediator object, which obtains the needed service from another collaborator
d) None of the mentioned
a
8. The Mediator pattern has which of the following advantages?
a) It decouples collaborators, making them more changeable and reusable
b) It centralizes control of an interaction in the mediator class, making it easier to change, thus increasing modifiability
c) It simplifies the collaborators, making them easier to understand, and hence to change
d) All of the mentioned
d
9. Which are the drawback for mediator pattern?
a) It may also increase collaborator cohesion
b) Forcing collaborator interaction through the mediator may compromise performance
c) All of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned
b
10. Which of the following is consequence of mediator class?
a) They makes a sub-system easier for clients to use
b) Lowers the coupling between the client and the sub-system
c) Increase re-usability by adapting a sub-system’s interface to client needs
d) It encapsulates an interaction, making the interaction easier to change
