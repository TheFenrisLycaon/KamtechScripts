1. Which of the following statement is true?
a) A transition is a change from one state to another
b) Transitions may be spontaneous, but usually some event triggers them
c) An event is a noteworthy occurrence at a particular time; events have no duration
d) All of the mentioned
d
2. Every finite automaton specification must contain which of the following?
a) Descriptions of the automaton’s states in a way that allows them to be distinguished, such as by naming each one;
b) Descriptions of transitions indicating each transition source state, its target state, and the events that trigger it;
c) Designation of an initial state, the starting place for state transitions
d) All of the mentioned
d
3. What does deterministic and non deterministic automation?
a) A non-deterministic finite automaton is a finite automaton that has no spontaneous transitions and has a single transition that it must make in response to every event in each of its states
b) A deterministic finite automaton is one with multiple transitions
c) All of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned
d
4. Which of the following determines the state diagram?
a) The UML notation for specifying finite automata is the state diagram
b) In state diagrams, states are represented by rounded rectangles
c) All of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned
c
5. Which of the following represents the State Diagram?
a) The finite automaton initial state is designated by a special initial pseudo-state depicted as a large black dot at the tail of an arrow pointing at the initial state
b) A finite automaton may execute forever or it may halt in a final state
c) Transitions are represented by solid arrows labeled with one or more transition strings that describe the circumstances under which the transition is triggered and the actions that may ensue
d) All of the mentioned
d
6. Which of the statements state the name compartment?

c) The name compartment can never be omitted
d) The first compartment is the name compartment, It contains the state name; State names are optional and may be path names
d
7. Which of the following is true?
a) A state symbol without a nested state compartment represents a complex state
b) One with a nested state compartment represents a simple state
c) All of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned

8. Which of the following are composite states?
a) A sequential composite state
b) A concurrent composite state
c) All of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned
c
9. What is sequential and concurrent composite state means?
a) A concurrent composite state contains a single state diagram composed of sub-states or inner states and the transitions between them
b) A sequential composite state contains two or more sequential state diagrams in regions separated by dashed lines called concurrent region boundary lines
c) All of the mentioned
d) None of the mentioned
d
10. Sequential composite states simplify state models in two ways?
