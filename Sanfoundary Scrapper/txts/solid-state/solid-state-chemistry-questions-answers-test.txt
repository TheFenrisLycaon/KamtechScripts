1. The collision between air molecules and diffracted X-ray are the___________
a)	Sources of background scattering
b)	Sources of front reflection
c)	Sources of diffraction
d)	Sources of background irradiation
a
2. The fluorescent radiation is absorbed by placing a filter when__________
a)	It is weak
b)	It is strong
c)	It is too much in quantity
d)	It holds more energy
a
3. If the fluorescent radiation is strong then which of the following parameters to be used?
a)	Changing the path length of the secondary beam
b)	Changing the wavelength of the primary beam
c)	Keeping the wavelength of the secondary beam constant
d)	Changing the frequency of the secondary beam
b
4. Fluorescent occurs when the radiation in the primary beam knocks out___________
a)	Outer shell electrons
b)	Inner shell electrons
c)	Outer shell photon
d)	Inner shell photon
b
5. Fluorescent radiation produced by electrons depends on which of the following factors?
a)	Concentration of the photon

6. Cu Kα radiation of wavelength 1.5418 A˚, is generated by which of the following transition?
a)	1s→2p
b)	3s→1s
c)	2s→4s
d)	2p→1s
d
7. Cu Kα radiation can ionize 1s electrons in which of the following elements?
a)	Cobalt
b)	Helium
c)	Nickel
d)	Hydrogen
a
Cu Kα radiation can ionize 1s electrons in cobalt and iron but not in nickel, helium and hydrogen. Because the ionization potentials of 1s electrons in nickel, cobalt and iron correspond to 1.4880, 1.6081 and 1.7433 A˚ and Cu Kα X-rays can ionize electrons in atoms whose ionization energy has a value corresponding to λ > 1.5418 A˚.
8. Lighter atoms _________
a)	Fluoresce  strongly
b)	Fluoresce less strongly
c)	Doesn’t Fluoresce
d)	Fluoresce very very strongly
b
9. When the X-rays strike a sample then the X-rays of the same wavelength as the incident beam is re-emitted and this is known as____________
a)	Modified radiation
b)	Same radiation
c)	Coherent radiation
d)	Non coherent radiation
c
10. Organic and organic based materials give which type of powder patterns?
a)	Very good quality powder pattern
b)	Very poor quality powder pattern
c)	Doesn’t give powder pattern at all
d)	High concentrated powder pattern
b
