a) Increase in the value of Si+
b) Decrease in the value of Si+ with increase in the value of Si–
c) Increase in the value of Si–
d) Decrease in the value of Si– with decrease in the value of Si–
c
8. Who was the first person to recommend plotting the cusum charts for mean and standard deviation on same graph?
a) Hawkins
b) Roberts
c) Atkinson
d) Crowder
a

a) The value of xi be replaced by xi
b) The value of xi be replaced by xi
c) The value of Ci+ be replaced by value of Ci–

10. A cusum for normal variance is having the value of upper cusum equal to __________
a) \(C_i^+=max⁡(0,C_{i-1}^+ + S^2 – k)\) 
b) \(C_i^+=max⁡(0,C_{i-1}^+ + S^2 + k)\) 
c) \(C_i^+=max⁡(0,C_{i-1}^+ – σ^2 + k)\) 
d) \(C_i^+=max⁡(0,C_{i-1}^+ + σ^2 + k)\) 
b
\(C_i^+=max⁡(0,C_{i-1}^+ + S^2 + k)\)
11. A cusum for a normal variance has the value of lower cusum equal to ___________
a) \(C_i^+=min⁡(0,C_{i-1}^- + S^2 + k)\) 
b) \(C_i^-=max⁡(0,C_{i-1}^- + S^2 + k)\) 
c) \(C_i^+=max⁡(0,C_{i-1}^- + S^2 + k)\) 
d) \(C_i^-=min⁡(0,C_{i-1}^- + S^2 + k)\) 
d
\(C_i^-=min⁡(0,C_{i-1}^- + S^2 + k)\)
12. If the value of C–i-1+S2+k is lesser than (-1), what will be the value of Ci– equal to?
a) Lesser than -1
b) Higher than 1
c) Lower than 0
d) 0
d
\(C_i^+=min⁡(0,C_{i-1}^- + S^2 + k)\) 
Also the cusum values, whether it is the upper cusum, or lower cusum, are either zero or positive. So even if the value of C–i-1+S2+k is lesser than (-1), the value of Ci– will be zero.
13. The V-mask procedure was proposed by ___________
a) Crowder
b) Roberts
c) Brinson
d) Barnard
d
14. Only the value of lower cusum can be negative.
a) True
b) False
b
\(C_i^-=max(0,C_{i-1}^- + S^2 + k)\) 
So we get to know that the value of the lower cusum is always greater than or equal to zero.
15. Tabular Cusums can be constructed for both, individual measurements, and the averages of the rational subgroups.
a) True
b) False
a
