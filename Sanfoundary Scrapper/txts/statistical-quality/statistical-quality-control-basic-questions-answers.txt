6. For a process, which has, USL and LSL equal to 60, and 5 respectively, and the value of \(\hat{σ}_{gauge}\) = 0.887, what will be the value of P/T ratio when k=6?
a) 0.087
b) 0.077

d) 0.097
d
\(\frac{P}{T}=\frac{k\hat{σ}_{gauge}}{USL-LSL}\)

10. Which of these can be used as the estimate of standard deviation of total variability which is including both product variability, and the gauge variability?
a) The sample mean
b) The sample variance
c) The sample standard deviation
d) No of defects in the sample
b
11. If the sample variance of a process is, 10.05, and the gauge capability standard deviation is estimated to be 0.79. What will be the value of the estimate of the standard deviation of the product variability?
a) 9.26

c) 2.03
d) 8.91
b
\(\sigma_{Total}^2=\sigma_P^2+\sigma_{Gauge}^2\) 
If the estimates are to be used, the same equation can be written for the corresponding estimate values. Putting the values as mentioned, we get, \(\hat{\sigma}_p^2\)=3.04.

d) \(ρ_p=\frac{\sigma_{gauge}^2}{2σ_{total}^2}\) 
c
\(ρ_p=\frac{\sigma_P^2}{σ_{Gauge}^2}\)
 
13. The gauge capability ratio ρM is expressed as ____________

a) True
b) False
b
15. ρP=1-ρM.
a) True
b) False
a
\(ρ_p=\frac{\sigma_{gauge}^2}{σ_{Total}^2}; ρ_p=\frac{\sigma_P^2}{σ_{Gauge}^2}; σ_{Total}^2=σ_P^2+σ_{Gauge}^2\) 
Combining all three equations, we get,
ρP=1-ρM.
