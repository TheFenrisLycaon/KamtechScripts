a) Hyper geometric Distribution
b) Binomial Distribution
c) Normal Distribution
d) Poisson Distribution
c
2. The mean of hyper geometric probability distribution is expressed as _____
a) μ=nD/N
b) μ=np
c) μ=r/p
d) μ=nN/D
a
μ=nD/N.
3. Probability function for hyper geometric probability distribution is _____
a) \(p(x) = \frac{\left(D \atop x\right)\left(N-D \atop n-x\right)}{\left(N \atop n\right)} \) 
b) \(p(x) = \frac{\left(D \atop x\right)\left(N-D \atop n-x\right)}{\left(n \atop N\right)} \) 
c) \(p(x) = \frac{\left(x \atop D\right)\left(N-D \atop n-x\right)}{\left(N \atop n\right)} \) 
d) \(p(x) = \frac{\left(D \atop x\right)\left(n-x \atop N-D\right)}{\left(N \atop n\right)} \) 
a
\(p(x) = \frac{\left(D \atop x\right)\left(N-D \atop n-x\right)}{\left(N \atop n\right)} \) 
Where D is a number of interest, N is total no. of items in population, x is the no. of sample falling in the class of interest and n is no. of items in a sample. 
4. For N=100, D=5, n=10, and x = 2; probability according to hypergeometric distribution will be _____
a) 0.58375
b) 0.92314
c) 0.99336
d) 0.99975
c
\(p(x) = \frac{\left(D \atop x\right)\left(N-D \atop n-x\right)}{\left(N \atop n\right)} \) 
This gives P(X≤x)=0.99336 for the mentioned values.
5. The independent trials which have either a “success” or a “failure” as an outcome, are called ____
a) Normal trials
b) Bernoulli trials
c) Poisson’s trials
d) Hyper geometric trials
b

6. The binomial distribution is given by _____
a) \(p(x) = \left(n \atop x\right) p^x (1-p)^{n-x}\) 
b) \(p(x) = \left(x \atop n\right) p^{n-x} (1-p)^x\) 
c) \(p(x) = \left(x \atop n\right) p^x (1-p)^{n-x}\) 
d) \(p(x) = \left(n \atop x\right) p^{n-x} (1-p)^x\) 
a
\(p(x) = \left(n \atop x\right) p^x (1-p)^{n-x}\). 
7. Let us take Bernoulli trial of tossing a coin. If there are 70 independent trials, and finding a head is a success, what will be the variance?
a) 17.5
b) 18.5
c) 4.8
d) 4.18
a
σ2=np(1-p)
For tossing a coin and finding a head, p = 0.5, which gives variance = 17.5.
8. Poisson distribution is given by ____
a) \(p(x) = \frac{e^{-λ} λ^x}{x!}\) 
b) \(p(x) = \frac{e^{-x} λ^x}{x}\) 
c) \(p(x) = \frac{e^{-λ} λ^x}{x}\) 
d) \(p(x) = \frac{e^{-λ} λ^x}{λ!}\) 
a
\(p(x) = \frac{e^{-λ} λ^x}{x!}\) 
Where λ is a parameter and λ > 0.
9. The mean of a Poisson distribution is _____
a) Greater than λ
b) Lesser than λ
c) Equal to λ
d) Having no relation with λ
c
10. For a company, which uses Poisson distributions to describe all the defects in its product, which has the parameter λ=4, what will be the probability of finding the selected product from a sample that will have 2 or less than 2 defects?
a) 0.2381
b) 0.2561
c) 0.2104
d) 0.3310
a
P{x≤2} = \(\sum_{x=2}^2 \frac{e^{-4} 4^x}{x!}\) = 0.018316 + 0.73263 + 0.146525 = 0.238104.
11. For a experiment following binomial distribution, the mean is 54.3, and the number of independent trials is 121. What will be the probability of failure?
a) 0.55123
b) 0.51000
c) 0.44877
d) 0.45700
a
p=0.44876.
So probability of failure = 1-p = 0.55123.
12. A lot follows hyper geometric distribution for defects found in its items. It contains 100 items out of which, 5 are defective. If 10 items are selected without replacement in a random order, what is the probability of finding 0 defective items?
a) 0.5837521
b) 0.4162479
c) 0.5708992
d) 0.4522222
a
\(p(x) = \frac{\left(D \atop x\right)\left(N-D \atop n-x\right)}{\left(N \atop n\right)} \) 
Putting values from the question, we get, p(x) = 0.5837521.
