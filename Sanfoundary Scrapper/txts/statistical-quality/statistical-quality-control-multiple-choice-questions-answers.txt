b) D2 R
c) R – D3 R
d) d2 R
a
LCL = D3 R. 
2. In the general equation of UCL of a control chart, for any x chart, which of these is used as the estimator of μ?
a) \(\bar{x}\) 
b) \(\bar{R}\) 
c) \(\bar{\bar{x}}\) 
d) \(\bar{\bar{R}}\) 
c
3. Which of these gives the correct value of A2 used in the equation for control limits of a x control chart?
a) \(\frac{3}{d_2 \sqrt{n}}\) 
b) \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{n}}\) 
c) \(\frac{3}{d_2}\) 
d) \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{d_2}}\) 
a
\(\frac{3}{d_2 \sqrt{n}}\)
4. In phase I application of x and R chart, the control limits obtained  from the equations are treated as ____________
a) Final limits
b) Trial limits
c) Warning limits
d) Pattern limits
b
5. Which term is having a closest meaning as Sampling Distributions?
a) Control charts
b) On site inspection
c) Whole lot inspection
d) Acceptance sampling
a
6. Process capability generally uses __________
a) Specifications
b) Control Limits
c) Process standard deviation
d) Mean of any one sample
b
7. The process standard deviation is given by __________
a) R/d2
b) Rd2
c) 1/d2
d) R/d
a
\(\hat{σ} = \frac{\bar{R}}{d_2}\)
8. For any process, the sample ranges are, 1.2,1.5,1.1,1.4,1.5. The subgroup size is 5. What will be the process standard deviation? Given: d2=2.326 and A2=0.577
a) 0.576
b) 2.322
c) 0.511
d) 2.463
a
\(\bar{R} = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{i=n} R_i}{n}\) and “process standard deviation = \(\frac{\bar{R}}{d_2}\)“, by using the values of R and d2 in the question, we get process standard deviation=0.576

b) Yes, Control limits=Specification limits/2
c) No
d) Yes, Control limits*0.5 = Specification limits
c
11. Control limits are ___________

c) Limits driven by the inherent variability of the process
d) Statistical limits
b
12. The natural variability of the process is measured by ____________
a) Process mean
b) Sample standard deviation
c) Process standard deviation
d) Sample mean
c
13. What type of chart will be used to plot the number of defectives in the output of any process?
a) x bar chart
b) R chart
c) c chart
d) p chart
d

b) False
b
15.“There is no need of revision of control limits once calculated by the equations of control limits.
a) True
b) False
b
