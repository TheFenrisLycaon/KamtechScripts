a
\(LCL=LSL+\left(Z_γ+\frac{Z_β}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\); \(UCL=USL-\left(Z_γ+\frac{Z_β}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\)

b
7. When the values of δ and α are specified instead of the β and γ, what is the position of UCL of the acceptance control charts?
a) Between USL and μU
b) Between LSL and μU
c) Between μL and USL
d) Between μL and LSL
a
8. What is the expression for n which gives desired values of α, β, γ, and δ for any acceptance control chart?
a) \(n=\left(\frac{Z_α-Z_β}{Z_δ+Z_γ}\right)^2\) 
b) \(n=\left(\frac{Z_α+Z_β}{Z_δ+Z_γ}\right)^2\) 
c) \(n=\left(\frac{Z_α-Z_β}{Z_δ-Z_γ}\right)^2\) 
d) \(n=\left(\frac{Z_α+Z_β}{Z_δ-Z_γ}\right)^2\) 
b
\(n=\left(\frac{Z_α+Z_β}{Z_δ+Z_γ}\right)^2\)
9. if δ= 0.01, α=0.00135, γ=0.05, and β=0.2, what will be the sample size for the desired values of these?
a) n=38
b) n=2
c) n=32
d) n=45
c
\(n=\left(\frac{Z_α+Z_β}{Z_δ+Z_γ}\right)^2\) 
Putting the required values, we get,
\(n=\left(\frac{Z_{0.00135}+Z_{0.2}}{Z_{0.01}+Z_{0.05}}\right)^2\)=31.43≅32.

b) Sample size n
c) Type II error probability
d) Process fraction nonconforming
c
11. 2-sigma limits are recommended for the modified control charts. Which of these is not one of the reasons for this?
a) The spread must be low
b) The limits must be greater than the spread
c) Gives smaller β-risk
