a) Bond
b) Nelson
c) Robertson
d) Clarkes

d) \(ARL(2)_0=\frac{s^r-1}{2(r-1)}\) 
d
\(ARL(2)_0=\frac{s^r-1}{2(r-1)}\)
7. Which of these is one of the drawbacks of GCC?
a) Each stream does not need to be sampled at a time
b) There is no information about nonextreme streams at each trial. Thus no past value related EWMA can be constructed
c) It can’t be used for MSPs
d) It is very easy to construct
b
8. Dependent streams of an MSP are also called ____________
a) Accuracy streams
b) Cross Acceptance
c) Cross-correlated
d) Uncorrelated
c
9. Which of these is the correct model proposed for MSP by Mortell and Runger to accommodate the practical case of the dependent streams?
a) xtjk = μ – At + ϵtjk
b) xtjk = μ + At + ϵtjk
c) xtjk = μ – At – ϵtjk
d) xtjk = μ + At – ϵtjk
b
xtjk = μ + At + ϵtjk
Here cross-correlated streams have their data related to each other.
10. What does the term xtjk correspond to in the model proposed by Mortell and Runger?
a) k Th measurement on the jTh stream at time t
b) j Th measurement on the kTh stream at time t
c) t Th measurement on the jTh stream at time k
d) k Th measurement on the tTh stream at time j
a
xtjk = μ + At + ϵtjk
Here the term xtjk corresponds to k Th measurement on the j Th stream at time t.
11. The model given by Mortell and Runger represents two types of variability, σa2 accounting for the variance over time ___________ and σ2 accounting for the variation between the streams at specific time t.
a) Common to all streams
b) Specific to one stream
c) Specific to 2 streams
d) Specific to a group of 3 streams
a
12. What is the correct value of cross correlation given by the Mortell and Runger model?
a) \(ρ=\frac{2σ_a^2}{(σ_a^2+σ^2)}\) 
b) \(ρ=\frac{4σ_a^2}{(σ_a^2+σ^2)}\) 
c) \(ρ=\frac{σ_a^2}{(σ_a^2+σ^2)}\) 
d) \(ρ=\frac{2σ_a^2}{(σ_a^2-σ^2)}\) 
c
\(ρ=\frac{σ_a^2}{(σ_a^2+σ^2)}\)
13. Mortell and Runger proposed monitoring the average at time t of the means across all the streams with _________ control chart to detect an overall assignable cause.
a) A cusum
b) A EWMA
c) A p-chart
d) An individuals
d
14. The Mortell and Runger model did not propose to monitor the range of stream’s means at time t.
a) True
b) False
b
Rt = max⁡(xtj )-min⁡(xtj).
15. The proposed control charts on residuals are quite good than the GCC.
a) True
b) False
a
max⁡(xij )-xi
This chart is better than the GCC, especially when the variation in the process means over time is greater than the between-stream variability.
