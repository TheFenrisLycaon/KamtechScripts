a) p
b) c
c) x
d) u
d
8. The u charts are also called _________
a) The control chart for nonconformities
b) Control charts for fraction nonconforming
c) Control charts for conformities per unit
d) Control chart for process mean
c
9. The ratio of the number of nonconforming items in a population to total number of items in that population, is called _________
a) Fraction nonconforming
b) Fraction of nonconformities
c) Fraction of conformities per unit of product
d) Fraction of variability
a
10. The sample fraction nonconforming is expressed as __________
a) \(\hat{p}=\frac{2D}{n}\) 
b) \(\hat{p}=\frac{D}{3n}\) 
c) \(\hat{p}=\frac{D}{2n}\) 
d) \(\hat{p}=\frac{D}{n}\) 
d
\(\hat{p}=\frac{D}{n}\) 
Where D is nonconforming units and n is the sample size.
11. The center line of control chart of fraction nonconforming represents the value equal to ____________
a) Fraction nonconforming
b) Process mean
c) Process standard deviation
d) Sample mean
a
12. If there are 9 items defective in the sample size of 28, what will be the value that the fraction nonconforming chart, will represent?
a) 0.2971
b) 0.3214
c) 0.6328
d) 0.8172
b
\(\bar{p}=\frac{[∑_{i=1}^m D_i]}{mn}=\frac{9}{28}\)=0.3214

d) \(\bar{p}=\frac{[∑_{i=1}^{n} D_i]}{mn}\) 
c
\(\bar{p}=\frac{[∑_{i=1}^{m} D_i]}{mn}\)

a) True
b) False
b
15. Variable control charts can also be applied on attributes but their efficiency will be less as compared to the attribute control charts.
a) True
b) False
b
