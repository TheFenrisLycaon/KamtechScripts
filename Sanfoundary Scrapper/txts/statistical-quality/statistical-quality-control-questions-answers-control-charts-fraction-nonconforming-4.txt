1. The standardized control chart has the center line at ____________
a) 1 σ
b) 2 σ
c) Zero
d) -1σ
c
2. To deal with the variable sample size, the standardized chart is used, which has its upper limit at ___________
a) 3
b) -3
c) 1
d) 0
a
3. A type II error is also called a ___________
a) α Error
b) δ Error
c) β Error
d) ∅ Error
c
4. An OC curve is a display of ___________
a) β Error against defectives in a process output over a limited period of time

c) β Error against the process fraction nonconforming
d) Fraction nonconforming against β Error
c

a) ARl=1/β
b) ARL=β/α
c) ARL=1/βn
d) ARL=\(\frac{1}{probability\, of \,sample \,point\, plots\, out\, of\, control}\)

6. If the process is in control, the ARL for the fraction nonconforming chart, is calculated by __________
a) \(ARL_0=\frac{1}{\alpha}\) 
b) \(ARL_0=\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\) 
c) \(ARL_0=\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\) 
d) \(ARL_0=\frac{1}{\alpha \beta}\) 
a
ARL0=1/α.
7. If the for a fraction nonconforming chart, the probability of a sample point plotting out of control is 0.0531, what will be the ARL for this?
a) 12.31
b) 8.16
c) 18.83
d) 22.78
c
ARL = 1⁄p
Putting p=0.0531, ARL=18.83.
8. If a process is out of control, what will be its ARL for the fraction nonconforming chart?
a) \(ARL_1=\frac{1}{1-β}\) 
b) \(ARL_1=\frac{1-β}{1+β}\) 
c) \(ARL_1=\frac{1}{1+β}\) 
d) \(ARL_1=\frac{1+β}{1-β}\) 
a
\(ARL_1=\frac{1}{1-β}\)
9. If type II error probability for a process is 0.8594, its ARL will be ____
a) 8
b) 1
c) 3
d) 7
d
\(ARL_1=\frac{1}{1-β}\) 
We have, β=0.8594, so ARL1≅7 
10. We cannot analyze abnormal runs or patterns directly, on p-chart with variable sample size.
a) True
b) False
a
11. The gap between the UCL and LCL is double the gap between either one of them and the Center line, for the standardized chart.
a) True
b) False
a
