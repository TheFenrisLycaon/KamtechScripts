1. The upper control limits for the GCC will be ____________ for the x̅ chart.
a) UCL=\(\bar{\bar{x}}+A_2 \overline{R}\) 
b) UCL=\(\bar{\bar{x}}-A_2 R\) 
c) UCL=\(\bar{\bar{x}}-A_2 \overline{R}\) 
d) UCL=\(\bar{\bar{x}}+A_2 R\) 
a
UCL=\(\bar{\bar{x}}+A_2 \overline{R}\)
2. What is the value of the difference between the UCL and the LCL of x̅ chart of the GCC?
a) 1
b) 0
c) 3A2 R
d) 2A2 R
d
UCL=\(\bar{\bar{x}}+A_2 \overline{R}\); LCL=\(\bar{\bar{x}}-A_2 \overline{R}\) 
So the difference between the control limits of GCC will be 2A2 R
3. What is the value of the UCL of the R chart constructed for the GCC?
a) UCL = D4 R
b) UCL = D3 R
c) UCL = R ̅+ D3 R
d) UCL = R ̅+ D4 R
a
UCL=D4 R
4. What is the ratio of the UCL to LCL of the same GCC R chart?
a) UCL/LCL=D2/D3
b) UCL/LCL=D3/D4
c) UCL/LCL=D4/D3
d) UCL/LCL=D4/D2
c
UCL=D4 R ;LCL=D3 R
So their ratio will be,
UCL/LCL=D4/D3. 
5. If the sample size is 4, what will be the value of the upper control limit of the GCC R chart?
a) UCL=2.672R̅
b) UCL=2.282R̅
c) UCL=2.114R̅
d) UCL=2.574R̅
b
UCL=2.282R

6. What will be the value of the LCL of the x chart of the GCC when the value of x =12, and the value of R̅= 0.1 and sample size = 4?
a) 12.0729
b) 12.9271
c) 11.9271
d) 11.0729
a
UCL=12.0729.
7. When the subgroup size is 4 for any process samples, what will be the value of the R chart LCL of the GCC?
a) 5
b) 1
c) 0
d) 2
c
8. In GCC we plot ___________ means observed at any time period.
a) Only the maximum
b) Only the minimum
c) Mean of the
d) Both, the maximum and the minimum
d
9. ___________ range will be plotted on the R chart of the GCC.
a) Maximum
b) Minimum
c) Both the maximum and the minimum
d) Neither the maximum nor the minimum
a
10. Each plotted point on the GCC is identified by __________
a) The mean value of the stream
b) The stream that produced it
c) The standard deviation of the stream
d) The variance of the stream
b
11. A MSP is out of control if a point on the GCC exceeds __________
a) 3-sigma limit
b) 2-sigma limit
c) 1.5-sigma limit
d) 1-sigma limit
a
12. What is the value of the one sided in-control ARL for the GCC?
a) \(ARL(1)_0=\frac{s^r}{s-1}\) 
b) \(ARL(1)_0=\frac{s^r-1}{s-1}\) 
c) \(ARL(1)_0=\frac{s^{2r}-1}{s+1}\) 
d) \(ARL(1)_0=\frac{s^r+1}{s+1}\) 
b
\(ARL(1)_0=\frac{s^r-1}{s-1}\)
13. If there are 6 streams of a MSP, and one of the streams has given 4 consecutive times the largest value, what will be the value of the one sided in-control ARL for this event?
a) 200
b) 400
c) 259
d) 421
c
\(ARL(1)_0=\frac{s^r-1}{s-1}\) 
By putting the values, we get, ARL(1)0=259.
14. Runs tests can be applied on the GCC.
a) True
b) False
b
15. If the number of times a particular stream gives the maximum value of average or range for the GCC, increases, the value of one sided in-control ARL  for that event will increase.
a) True
b) False
a
\(ARL(1)_0=\frac{s^r-1}{s-1}\) 
As the value of r increases, the value of ARL(1)0 also increases.
