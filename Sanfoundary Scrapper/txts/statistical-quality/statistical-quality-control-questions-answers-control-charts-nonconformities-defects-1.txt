c) Number of defects observed
d) Deviation from median of the defects in samples
c
4. Which of these is an assumption made for designing a control chart for noncorformities?
a) Normal Distribution
b) Poisson Distribution
c) Lognormal Distribution
d) Weibull Distribution
b
5. Which of these is not an assumption of the c-chart?
a) Number of potential locations for nonconformities should be large
b) Probability of occurrence of nonconformities should be small
c) Probability of occurrence of nonconformities should be variable
d) Probability of occurrence of nonconformities should be constant
c
6. What will be the value of the 3-sigma Upper control limit for the c chart when standard is given?
a) UCL = c + 3√c
b) UCL = c – √c
c) UCL = c + √c
d) UCL = c + 2√c
a
UCL = c + √c.
7. The center line for the control chart for nonconformities is representing the value equal c, which is ____________
a) The total number of nonconformities
b) The average number of conformities in a preliminary sample
c) The total number of nonconforming products
d) The total number of conforming products
b
8. When there is no standard given, the value of LCL for the c-chart is given by ___________
a) LCL=\(\bar{c}-3\sqrt{\bar{c}}\) 
b) LCL=\(\bar{c}+2\sqrt{\bar{c}}\) 
c) LCL=\(\bar{c}-2\sqrt{\bar{c}}\) 
d) LCL=\(\bar{c}+3\sqrt{\bar{c}}\) 
d
LCL=\(\bar{c}+3\sqrt{\bar{c}}\)
9. If the average number of nonconformities in a preliminary sample of a process is 19.67, which of these represents the value of UCL for a c-chart for this process output?
a) 19.67
b) 6.37
c) 32.97
d) 25.77
c
UCL=\(\bar{c}-3\sqrt{\bar{c}}\) 
Now UCL=32.97.
10. For c=13.11, what will be the value of LCL for the c-chart?
a) 23.97
b) 10.86
c) 8.84
d) 2.24
d
LCL=\(\bar{c}+3\sqrt{\bar{c}}\) 
Putting c=13.11, we get LCL for the control chart for nonconformities = 2.24. 
11. With c-chart, which of these is used to analyze nonconformity data?
a) X bar charts
b) R charts
c) Cause and Effect diagram
d) Tolerance Diagram
c
12. The control chart used to inspect the process state by using the average number of nonconformities per unit data, is called _______________
a) u-chart
b) c-chart
c) p-chart
d) R-chart
a
13. If xi=total number of nonconformities in a sample of ni inspection units, and there are N samples of different sample size, and x varies according to a Poisson distribution, what will be the value of center line of the u-chart?
a) \(\bar{u} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{2x_i}{n_i}}{N}\) 
b) \(\bar{u} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{x_i}{2n_i}}{2N}\) 
c) \(\bar{u} =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{x_i}{n_i}}{N}\) 
d) \(\bar{u} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{x_i}{n_i}}{2N}\) 
c
\(\bar{u} =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{x_i}{n_i}}{N}\)

a) True
b) False
b
15. The sample for the control chart for nonconformities is assumed to have, a variable sample size, and the sample conformities distributed according to Normal distribution.

b

a) Defects per unit
b) Average number of defects per unit
c) Total number of nonconformities
d) Occurrence of n defects in N number of units
d
