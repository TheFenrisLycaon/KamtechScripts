b) Class D
c) Class A
d) Class B
d
6. The Class A defects are ____________
a) Moderate
b) Minor
c) Serious
d) Very Serious
d
7. The minor defects are put into class ____________ of the demerit system.
a) A
b) B
c) C
d) D
a
8. The minor finish, appearance, or quality of work defects are generally classified in _____ of the demerit system.
a) Class A
b) Class D
c) Class C
d) Class B
b
9. Moderate defects are classified into which class of demerit system?
a) Class B
b) Class C
c) Class D
d) Class A
a
10. The number of demerits in a system having ciA,ciB,ciC,and ciD  defects in classes A, B, C, and D respectively is expressed by ______ It is assumed that the probability of each defect varies according to a Poisson distribution.
a) di = 100ciD + 50ciB + 10ciC + ciA
b) di = 100ciA + 50ciB + 10ciC + ciD
c) di = 100ciB + 50ciA + 10ciC + ciD
d) di = 100ciA + 50ciC + 10ciB + ciD
b
di = 100ciA + 50ciB + 10ciC + ciD.
11. If there are 8, 12, 11, 3, 6 demerits in sample number 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively, what will be the demerits per units for the mentioned output?
a) 8
b) 11
c) 3
d) 5
a
\(u_i=\frac{D}{n}\) 
Where D=\(\sum_{i=1}^n d_i\) = 40 and n=5. We get ui=8
12. The upper control limit for the demerits per unit chart is given by _____
a) UCL = \(\bar{u}-3\widehat{σ_u}\) 
b) UCL = \(\bar{u}+3\widehat{σ_u}\) 
c) UCL = \(\bar{u}+\widehat{σ_u}\) 
d) UCL = \(\bar{u}-\widehat{σ_u}\) 
b
UCL = \(\bar{u}+3\widehat{σ_u}\) 
Where \(\bar{u}=100\overline{u_A}+50\overline{u_B}+10\overline{u_C}+\overline{u_D}\)
13. What is the value of the center line of the demerits per unit?
a) \(\bar{u}+3\sqrt{\bar{u}}\) 
b) \(\bar{u}\) 
c) \(\bar{u}+\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\bar{u}}\) 
d) \(\bar{u}-3\sqrt{\bar{u}}\) 
b
CL = u
14. A serious defect is defined as the defect which makes the unit totally unfit for use.

a) Appearance Defects
b) Functional Defects
c) Specification Defects
d) Aspect defects
b
