b) Discrete and continuous values
c) Zero and infinite value
d) One or zero
a
4. Control of the process average or mean quality level is usually done with the ___________ control chart.
a) X bar control chart
b) S control chart
c) R chart
d) P chart
a
5. S chart is used to monitor _________ of a quality characteristic.
a) Mean
b) Range
c) Variability
d) Attributes
c
6. Toughness of a bolt mount on a tank is  __________
a) An attribute
b) A variable
c) Variable and an attribute
d) Variability
b
7. X chart is a ____________
a) Attribute control chart
b) Variable control chart
c) Neither a variable control chart nor an attribute control chart
d) Falls in the category of both variable and attribute control charts
b
8. If a process is said to be in control, what can we say about the variation?
a) Random
b) Normal
c) Attribute
d) Assignable
a
9. Tolerances are said to be ________
a) limits of natural variability
b) Statistical limits of variability
c) Limits determined by the customers of the product
d) Limits of inherent process variability
a
10. Upper control limit for a x chart is expressed by ________
a) \(\bar{\bar{x}} + A_2 R \) 
b) \(\bar{\bar{x}} – A_2 R\) 
c) \(\bar{\bar{x}} + A_2 \bar{R}\) 
d) \(\bar{\bar{x}} + A_3 R\) 
a
11. The center line for a \(\bar{\bar{x}}\) chart denotes ________
a) Mean of any sample
b) Mean of means of the sample
c) Mean of any sample + 0.5
d) (Mean of any sample) / 0.5
b
12. Specifications have the same meaning as ____________
a) Control limits
b) UCL
c) LCL
d) Tolerances
d
13. For a random variable having a normal distribution, the ratio of its range to the standard deviation is called ____________
a) Relative range
b) Absolute range
c) Major range
d) Minor range
a
14. Process variability can only be described and monitored by the s control chart.
a) True
b) False
b
15. The lower control limit for an x bar control chart is lesser than the mean of means of the samples taken.
a) True
b) False
a
LCL = \(\bar{\bar{x}} – A_2 R\) 
So it is lower than process mean or the mean of means of samples taken.
