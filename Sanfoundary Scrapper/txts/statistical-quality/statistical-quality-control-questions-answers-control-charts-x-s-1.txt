6. The center line of the s chart with a standard value for σ given, denotes the value of _____
a) B6 σ
b) c4 σ
c) B5 σ
d) c5 σ
b
CL=B6 σ
7. If the sample standard deviations for a process are 1.567, 1.429, 1.323, 1.525, 1.989, 1.457, what will be the mean standard deviation?
a) 1.548
b) 1.858
c) 1.327
d) 1.967
a
\(\bar{s} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m s_i\) 
Where si denotes the standard deviation of ith sample. Calculating the mean using the above formaula gives, s=1.548.  
8. What is the value of B5 in the terms of c4?
a) \(c_4-3\sqrt{(1-c_4^2)}\) 
b) \(c_4+3\sqrt{(1+c_4^2)}\) 
c) \(c_4+3\sqrt{(1-c_4^2)}\) 
d) \(c_4-3\sqrt{(1+c_4^2)}\) 
a
B5 = \(c_4-3\sqrt{(1-c_4^2)}\)
 
9. The center line of the s chart denotes ____
a) Standard deviation of the process
b) Mean of m number of standard deviations, where m is the number of samples
c) c4 s
d) B5 s
b
10. What is the value of LCL for the s chart when the standard value for σ is not given?
a) B5 s
b) B4 s
c) B6 s
d) B3 s
d
11. What is the value of B3 in the terms of c4?
a) \(c_4-3\sqrt{(1-c_4^2)}\) 
b) \(c_4+3\sqrt{(1+c_4^2)}\) 
c) \(1-\frac{3}{c_4} \sqrt{(1-c_4^2)}\) 
d) \(1-\frac{c_4}{3\sqrt{(1-c_4^2)}}\) 
c
B3 = \(1-\frac{3}{c_4} \sqrt{(1-c_4^2)}\)
12. What is the formula for UCL for x bar chart when s is known?
a) \(UCL = \bar{\bar{x}} + A_3 \bar{s}\) 
b) \(UCL = \bar{\bar{x}} – A_2 \bar{s}\) 
c) \(UCL = \bar{\bar{x}} – A_3 \bar{s}\) 
d) \(UCL = \bar{\bar{x}} + A_2 \bar{s}\) 
a
\(UCL = \bar{\bar{x}} + A_3 \bar{s}\)
13. For mean of all sample standard deviations=0.0094 and the sample size= 5, what will be the estimate of process standard deviation?
a) 100
b) 0.01
c) 0.0094
d) 94
b
\(\hat{\sigma} = \frac{\bar{s}}{c_4} \) 
Here for sample size=5, c4=0.94, and s = 0.0094, we get σ = 0.01.
