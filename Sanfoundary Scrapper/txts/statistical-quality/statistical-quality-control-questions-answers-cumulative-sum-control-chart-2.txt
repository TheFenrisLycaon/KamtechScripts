1. Which of these is a reason, why the Cusum charts are better than the Shewhart control charts?
a) Because they are having information about only one sample
b) Because the quantity plotted on the Shewhart control charts is variable
c) Because the quantity plotted on the Cusum chart contains information about more than one sample
d) Because the quantity plotted on the Cusum control charts is containing information about a single sample
c
2. Which charts are particularly more effective for sample size one?
a) p-charts
b) c-charts
c) X bar and s charts
d) Cusum charts
d
3. Which charts are more effective for the chemical and process industries?
a) p-charts
b) c-charts
c) X bar and s charts
d) Cusum charts
d
4. The processes where discrete part manufacturing is done, which charts are better?
a) p-charts
b) c-charts
c) Cusum charts
d) X bar and R charts
c
5. Which of these control charts will have a better performance in the discrete part manufacturing assembly, where automatic measurement of each part is done?
a) X bar charts
b) Cusum charts
c) u-charts
d) c-charts
b
6. Cumulative control charts were first presented by ____________
a) Shewhart
b) ASQC
c) ASQ
d) Page
d
7. If the mean changes to a higher value, what will be the effect on the cumulative sum?
a) Decrease
b) Increase
c) Can decrease or increase
d) Can’t be predicted.
b
\(C_i=\sum_{j=1}^i (\bar{x}_i-μ)\) 
That it will introduce a positive drift in the cumulative sum too.
8. If the value of the cumulative sum shifts to a lower value what is likely to be the reason for it?
a) The decrease in the value of the mean
b) The increase in the value of the mean
c) No change in the value of mean
d) Decrement in the value of the standard deviation
a
9. How are the changes in the conditions of the process, known using the Cusum charts?
a) By the change in Cusum value
b) By the change in the sample standard deviation
c) By plotting a s chart first
d) By plotting an R chart first
a
10. A significant trend upwards in the process cumulative sum chart indicates ____________
a) Shifting of mean in the positive direction
b) Shifting of mean in the negative direction
c) No shift in the process condition
d) No shift in the mean
a
11. Which of these conditions don’t describe an assignable cause in the process?
a) A positive shift in the Cusum value
b) A negative shift in the Cusum value
c) Random change in Cusum value
d) Continuous upward drift of Cusum value after a continuous downward drift in the Cusum value
c
12. Which of these is another form of the cumulative sum value plotted on the cumulative sum chart?
a) \(C_i=(x_i-μ)+\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} (x_j+μ)\) 
b) \(C_i=(x_i-μ)+C_{i-1}\) 
c) \(C_i=(x_i-μ)+\sum_{j=1}^{i-1} (x_j+2μ)\) 
d) \(C_i=(x_i-μ)-C_{i-1}\) 
b
\(C_i=\sum_{j=1}^i (\bar{x}_j-μ_0) \) 
This can be written as,
\(C_i=(x_i-μ)+\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}(x_j-μ)=(x_i-μ)+C_{i-1}\)
13. If the value of xi=9.29, and Ci-1=-2.56, what will be the value of the cumulative sum for this sample, if the value of μ0=10?
a) -3.27
b) -5.13
c) 3.27
d) 5.13
a
Ci=(xi-μ)+Ci-1
Putting the values from the question, we get,
Ci=-3.27 
14. Upward or downward shifts in the Cusum value, directly indicate changes in process condition.
a) True
b) False
a
15. A change of process mean changes the value of Ci>Ci-1,  so we can say that the process mean has shifted upwards.
a) True
b) False
a
