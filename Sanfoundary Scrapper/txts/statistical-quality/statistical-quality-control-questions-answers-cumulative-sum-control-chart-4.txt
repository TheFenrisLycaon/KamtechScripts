b
\(C_i^+=max⁡[0,x_i-(μ_0+K)+C_{i-1}^+]\)

b) \(C_i^-=max⁡[0,x_i-(μ_0+K)+C_{i-1}^-]\) 
c) \(C_i^-=min⁡[0,(μ_0-K)-x_i+C_{i-1}^-]\) 
d) \(C_i^-=max⁡[0,(μ_0-K)-x_i+C_{i-1}^-]\) 
d
\(C_i^-=max⁡[0,(μ_0-K)-x_i+C_{i-1}^-]\)
3. What is K called in the expressions of the one-sided Cusums?
a) Regarded value
b) Related value
c) Resultant value
d) Reference value
d
4. Which of these is another name of the reference value?
a) Regarding value
b) Stoppage value
c) Stack value
d) Assignable value
c
5. The value of the reference value is chosen ____________
a) 3/4 ways between mean and the out-of-control mean towards the mean
b) 1/2 ways between mean and the out-of-control mean
c) 3/4 ways between mean and the out-of-control mean towards the out-of-control mean
d) 1/4 ways between mean and the out-of-control mean towards the mean
b
6. What is the value δ is called, when used in the expression of K?
a) The shift of mean in standard deviation units
b) The shift of variance in standard deviation units
c) The shift of standard deviation in mean units
d) The shift of mean in variance units
a
K=\(\frac{\delta\sigma}{2}\) 
Here this value δ is called the shift of mean in standard deviation units.
7. What is the value of μ1(out-of-control mean) in the terms of the actual target mean μ0, and the shift?
a) μ1=μ0+δσ
b) μ1=μ0+2δσ
c) μ1=μ0+\(\frac{δ}{2}\)σ
d) μ1=μ0-δσ
a
μ1=μ0+δσ.
8. What is the value of K in the terms of out-of-control mean and the target mean?
a) \(K=\frac{|μ_0-μ_1|}{2}\) 
b) \(K=\frac{|μ_1-μ_0|}{2}\) 
c) \(K=\frac{|μ_1-μ_0|}{4}\) 
d) \(K=3\frac{|μ_1-μ_0|}{4}\) 
b
\(K=\frac{|μ_1-μ_0|}{2}\)
9. What is the starting value of one-sided upper cusum?
a) 1
b) 6
c) 5
d) 0
d
\(C_i^+=max⁡[0,x_i-(μ_0+K)+C_{i-1}^+]\) 
The starting value of this would be C0+ which is always taken as 0.
10. What is the starting value of the one-sided lower cusum?
a) 1.5
b) -1.5
c) 0
d) .3
c
\(C_i^-=max⁡[0,(μ_0-K)-x_i+C_{i-1}^-]\) 
This value is called the starting value of lower one-sided cusum when the value of i=0. The value of C0–=0.
11. If the value of the quantity ”\((μ_0-K)-x_i+C_{i-1}^-\)” becomes negative, what will be the value of the value Ci–?
a) Negative
b) Positive
c) Zero
d) Can be both, ±1
c
\(C_i^-=max⁡[0,(μ_0-K)-x_i+C_{i-1}^-]\) 
So, as the value of quantity \((μ_0-K)-x_i+C_{i-1}^-\) becomes negative, it becomes lesser than 0. So we take the maximum value between zero and it, i.e. Ci–=0
12. Which of these is always correct?
a) \(C_i^-≥0 \) 
b) \(C_i^-≤0\) 
c) \(C_i^->1.323\) 
d) \(C_i^-<-1.323\) 
a
13. After the value of Ci– increasing than the value of _____ the process is said to be out-of-control.
a) Control interval
b) Decision interval
c) Distribution interval
d) Calculation interval
b
14. If the value of μ0 > μ1, K will have a negative value.
a) True
b) False
b
\(K=\frac{|μ_1-μ_0|}{2}\) 
So even if μ0 > μ1, K will have its value greater than 0.
15. The generally used value of K is the only value, which substantially impact the performance of the cusum.
a) True
b) False
b
