1. What will be the variance of the sample following hyper geometric distribution and having 5 items defective in 100 lot items, if 10 samples are taken without replacement?
a) 0.431818
b) 0.410023
c) 0.483838
d) 0.568898
a
\(\sigma^2 = \frac{nD}{N} (1-\frac{D}{n})(\frac{N-n}{N-1})\)
Putting, N=100, n=10, D=5; we get variance=0.431818.
2. For a Poisson distribution, parameter λ is having a value of 7. What is the variance for the distribution?
a) 2.64
b) 2.78
c)  7
d) 14
c
3. For 9 Bernoulli trials, what will be the mean of trials when the probability of failure is 0.56?
a) 5.04
b) 1.74
c) 3.96
d) 2.82
c
 p = 1 – 0.56 = 0.44.
Using this, we get;
mean= np=9*0.44=3.96.
4. In sample fraction defective, the   ̂ symbol represents that ______
a) p ̂  is an estimate of the true value of binomial parameter p
b) It is the “raised to power” operator
c) It is having no significance
d) It is the true value of binomial parameter p
a
5. For a Pascal distribution, the probability of occurrence of a event x is given by _____
a) \(p(x)=\left(x-1 \atop r-1\right) p^x (1-p)^{x-r}\) 
b) \(p(x)=\left(r-1 \atop x-1\right) p^x (1-p)^{x-r}\) 
c) \(p(x)=\left(x-1 \atop r-1\right) p^x (1-p)^{1-r}\) 
d) \(p(x)=\left(x-1 \atop r-1\right) p^x (1-p)^{x-1}\) 
a
\(p(x)=\left(x-1 \atop r-1\right) p^x (1-p)^{x-r}\) 
Where x=r, r+1, r+2… and r≥1 is an integer.
6. When is Pascal distribution, called negative binomial distribution?
a) When r>0 but not necessarily an integer
b) When r<0 but an integer
c) When r>3 and an integer
d) When r=0 and an integer
a
7. When r=1 in a Pascal distribution, what is this case called?
a) Negative binomial distribution
b) Positive binomial distribution
c) Hyper geometric distribution
d) Geometric distribution
d
8. Lognormal distributions are a part of discrete distributions.
a) True
b) False
b
9. Which of the expression represents the mean of Pascal distribution?
a) r/p
b) np
c) nD/N
d) np(1-p)
a
μ=r/p
Where r > 1 and an integer and p is probability of success. 
10. The equation of variance, i.e. σ2=\(\frac{r(1-p)}{p^2}\) is true for _____
a) Hyper geometric distribution
b) Pascal Distribution
c) Normal distribution
d) Binomial distribution
b
11. Bernoulli trials are a part of _____ probability distribution.
a) Poisson
b) Binomial
c) Hyper geometric
d) Normal
b
12. \( \left(a \atop b\right)\) is expanded as __________
a) \(\frac{a!}{b!}\) 
b) \(\frac{a!}{b!(a-b)!}\) 
c) \(\frac{a!}{b!(b-a)!}\) 
d) \(\frac{b!}{a!}\) 
b
13. For a Pascal distribution; r=3 and the probability of success is 0.7895. What will be the value of “σ”?
a) 1.0131
b) 3
c) 1.0065
d) 1.7320
c
σ2=r(1-p)/p2
Evaluation of the above equation using the values r=3 and p=0.7895, we get, σ=1.0063.
14. For evaluation probability of measurement of length of a part being a certain value, discrete probability distributions can be used.
a) True
b) False
b
