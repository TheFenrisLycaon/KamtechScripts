c
UCL=\(\bar{p}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{\bar{p}(1-\bar{p})}{n}}\)

a) The sample is investigated for an assignable cause and then the sample data is eliminated to develop a new p-chart
b) The sample is only investigated for an assignable cause
c) The sample is not investigated at all (It is assumed that there was no assignable cause present)
d) All the samples are investigated
a
7. Even if the process is in control according to p-chart and the fraction nonconforming is too high, it states that _________
a) The process is not stable
b) The process is stable but there are no operator controllable problems
c) The process is stable but there are some operator controllable problems
d) The process is out of control
b
8. If the fraction nonconforming for 7 samples are 0.11,0.24,0.21,0.14,0.24,0.21,0.17, what is the value for the center line for a p-chart?
a) 0.19
b) 0.21
c) 0.12
d) 0.13
a
\(CL=\bar{p}=\frac{\sum_{i=0}^n p_i}{n}\) 
This gives, CL=0.19 for the above question.
9. If the sample size for a p-chart is 50 and the value for the center line of the chart is 0.2313, what will be the value of the LCL of the chart?
a) 0.4108
b) 0.0524
c) 0.0762
d) 0.0389
b
LCL=\(p-\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\) 
When we put the value of CL=p=0.2313, we get LCL=0.0524.

a) Final limits
b) Concluded limits
c) Trial limits
d) Absolute limits
c
11. Which of these is not one of the parameters which need to be specified for fraction nonconforming control charts?

c) \(\delta=L\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\) 
d) \(\delta=L\sqrt{\frac{np(1-np)}{n}}\) 
c
\(\delta=L\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\) 
for a process to be in control.

c) \(n=(\frac{L}{\delta})^2 (1-p)\) 
d) \(n=(\frac{L}{\delta})^2 p(1+p)\) 
a
\(n=(\frac{L}{\delta})^2 p(1-p)\)
14. In the p-chart, even if only one point is out of control, we should conclude that the process is out-of-control.
a) True
b) False
b
15. Non-defective term has the same meaning as Nonconforming.
a) True
b) False
b
