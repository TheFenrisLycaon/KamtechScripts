b) \(\sqrt{\frac{3ρ_p}{1-ρ_p}}\) 
c) \(\sqrt{\frac{ρ_p}{1-ρ_p}}\) 
d) \(\frac{2ρ_p}{1-ρ_p}\) 
a
SNR=\(\sqrt{\frac{2ρ_p}{1-ρ_p}}\)
3. What is the correct definition of SNR?
a) The number of signals for 30 noise indications on control chart
b) The number of signals for single noise indication on control chart
c) The number of signals with no noise from the measurements
d) The number of distinct levels or categories that can be reliably obtained from the measurements
d
4. If the estimate of pp is 0.9214, what will be the estimate of SNR?
a) 4.84
b) 6.87
c) 9.12
d) 2.13
a
SNR=\(\sqrt{\frac{2ρ_p}{1-ρ_p}}\) 
By putting the value of the estimate of ρp  we get SNR estimate = 4.84.
5. Which of these is not one of the gauge capability ratios?
a) SNR
b) Cp
c) ρM
d) ρp
d
6. What is the full-form of DR in the context of gauge capability?
a) Decrease rate
b) Direction ratios
c) Discrimination ratios
d) Dimension rates
c
7. What is the value of DR?
a) DR=\(\frac{1-2ρ_p}{1+ρ_p}\) 
b) DR=\(\frac{1+ρ_p}{1-ρ_p}\) 
c) DR=\(\frac{1+2ρ_p}{1-ρ_p}\) 
d) DR=\(\frac{1-ρ_p}{1+ρ_p}\) 
d
DR=\(\frac{1-ρ_p}{1+ρ_p}\)
8. For a measurement system ρp=0.8914. What will be the value of DR for that?
a) 17.416
b) 0.0571
c) 24.46
d) 0.0652
a
DR=\(\frac{1-ρ_p}{1+ρ_p}\) 
Putting the values, we get DR=17.416.

b) 0.4
c) 0.1
d) 4
d
10. Which of these tells about the inherent variability of the gauge?
a) Accuracy
b) Precision
c) DR ratio
d) SNR
b
11. The picture indicates gauge measurements where the dark circle is true value and the dots as observed value. This picture shows _____
a) More accuracy, less precision
b) Neither accuracy nor precision
c) More precision, less accuracy
d) High accuracy and precision
a
12. The standard model for a gauge R & R study is also called ____________
a) Random effects model analysis of variance
b) Continuous effects model analysis of variance
c) Discrete effects model analysis of variance
d) Attribute effects model analysis of variance
a
13. The more the gauge capability, the more are the ____________
a) Tolerances
b) Specifications
c) Chances of rejection
d) Chances of no error in measurements
d
14. Even if the instantaneous value measured for a dimension by a gauge is not equal to the true value, but the gauge can still be accurate.
a) True
b) False
a
15. An equipment can be more precise but not accurate at the same time.
a) True
b) False
a
