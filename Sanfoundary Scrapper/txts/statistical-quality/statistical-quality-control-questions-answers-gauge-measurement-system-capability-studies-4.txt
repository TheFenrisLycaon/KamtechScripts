6. If the value of the variance of the product variability increases, what will be the effect on the variance of the gauge?
a) Increase
b) Decrease
c) No change
d) Can’t be predicted (no dependency over each other)
d
7. If the variance of the total observed measurement is constant and the gauge capability ratio ρ_M is increased, what will be change in the gauge measurement variance?
a) Increase
b) Decrease
c) No change
d) Can’t be predicted (no dependency over each other)
a
\(ρ_M=\left(\frac{\sigma_{gauge}^2}{\sigma_{Total}^2}\right)\) 
So if the variance of the total observed measurement is kept constant with the gauge capability ratio ρM increasing, the variance of gauge measurement will be increased.
8. If the variance of product variability is increased while keeping the total observed measurement variance constant, what will be effect on the gauge capability ratio ρP?
a) Increase
b) Decrease
c) No change
d) Can’t be predicted (no dependency over each other)
a
ρP∝ σp2
So, the gauge capability ratio ρP will increase with increase with increase in the variance in product variability σp2.
9. If the value of product variance is increased with the variance of the total observed measurement kept constant, the value of the gauge capability ratio ρM increases.
a) True
b) False
b
\(\sigma_{Total}^2 = \sigma_{gauge}^2 + \sigma_P^2; ρ_M=\frac{\sigma_{gauge}^2}{\sigma_{Total}^2}\) 
Putting the equations together, we get to know that the value of ρM increases with decrease in the product variance.
10. A DR of value 5.89 indicates an adequate measurement system.
a) True
b) False
