1. Moving the UCL and LCL line far from the Center line means ____
a) Decreasing the possibility of type I error
b) Increasing the possibility of type II error
c) Increasing the possibility of type I error
d) Decreasing the possibility of type II error
a
2. If we decrease the distance between LCL and UCL, what will happen?
a) Decreasing the possibility of type I error
b) Increasing the possibility of type II error
c) Increasing the possibility of type I error
d) Decreasing the possibility of type II error
d
3. If “two sets of limits” approach is taken to construct a control chart, what are the outer set of limits called?
a) Action Limits
b) Warning Limits
c) Variable Limits
d) Constant Limits
a
4. The inner limits in the “Two sets of limits” approach of the construction of control chart are called _____
a) Action Limits
b) Variable Limits
c) Constant Limits
d) Warning Limits
d
5. ARL is termed as ____________
a) Average Run Length
b) Allocating Run Length
c) Affected Run Length
d) Assumed Run Length
a
6. The probability of a point to exceed the control limits for a control chart is 0.0040. What will be the ARL for this case?
a) 250
b) 278
c) 210
d) 216
a
ARL=\(\frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{0.0040}\)=250
7. For an average run length of 370, what will be the probability of a point falling out of the area between the control limits?
a) 0.0027
b) 0.0013
c) 0.0045
d) 0.0040
a
ARL = 1⁄p
Putting value of ARL=370, we get, p=0.0027.
8. What is the full-form of ATS?
a) Average time to Stop
b) Average Time to Start
c) Average Time to Signal
d) Average Time to Select
c
9. If for a process, the samples are taken 5 hrs apart and its ARL is 24.24, What will be ATS for it?
a) 121.2
b) 110.0
c) 113.3
d) 137.8
a
ATS=ARL.h
Putting values h=5,ARL=24.24; we get,
ATS=121.2.
10. Decreasing sample size will ________
a) Decrease the slope of OC curve
b) Increase the slope of OC curve
c) First decrease then increase the slope of OC curve
d) Makes OC curve have 0 slope
b
11. Which of these statements, correctly describes the concept of rational subgroups?
a) If assignable causes are present, the chances of difference between subgroups should be largest
b) If assignable causes are present, the chances of difference between subgroups must be lowest
c) If assignable causes are present, the chances of difference between the subgroups must be moderate
d) If assignable causes are present, the chances of difference between the subgroups must be zero
a
12. If the ARL is 34.8 for a process which has ATS=69.6 hrs, what is the time interval before taking samples?
a) 0.5 hrs
b) 8 hrs
c) 2 hrs
d) 4 hrs
c
h=\(\frac{ATS}{ARL}\) 
Putting values of ATS and ARL, we get h=2 hrs.
13. Which of these is not one of the sensitizing Western Electric rules that indicate “action needed” for Shewhart control charts?
a) One or more points near a warning limit/control limit
b) One point plots outside 3-sigma control limits
c) Eight consecutive points plot on one side of the control line
d) Two of 3 consecutive points plot beyond the 2-sigma warning limits
a
14. 14 points in a row alternating up and down the mean will not indicate action needed for any process for which a control chart is plotted.
a) True
b) False
b
15. If an assignable cause is expected in the process, the subgroups taken subsequently should have a maximum difference.
a) True
b) False
a
