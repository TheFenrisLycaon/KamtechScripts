1. The assumption that links normality to the control charts is ___________
a) The underlying distribution of the quality characteristic is normal
b) The normal mean will be equal to the process mean
c) The normal distribution is not the correct distribution for all the quality characteristic
d) Every distribution is a part of normal distribution
a
2. The probability of not detecting “an in-control shift” of the mean of the process is said to be the _____
a) α – Risk
b) β – Risk
c) γ – Risk
d) δ – Risk
b
3. If the sample size is 7 and the Average run length is 122 for a process, what will be the expected number of the individual units sampled?
a) 850
b) 854
c) 867
d) 844
b
I=nARL
Putting n=7 and ARL=122, we get, I = 854.
4. If β- risk of any process is 0.75, what will be the ARL for that process?
a) 4
b) 1.33
c) 0.86
d) 2
a
ARL=\(\frac{1}{1-β}\) 
Putting β=0.75, we get ARL=4.
5. Slope of OC curve for x bar chart will _________ when sample size is increased.
a) Decrease
b) Increase
c) Remain same
d) Decrease then increase
b
6. If the probability of one point plotting out of control limits of a X bar control charts is 0.0143, what will be its expected number of individual units sampled with subgroup size 8?
a) 559
b) 544
c) 530
d) 580
a
Using this data we get; I≈559.
7. A mixture pattern in the control chart points is exhibited when __________ occurs.
a) Operator fatigue
b) Change of raw materials
c) Continuous wear of tool
d) Adjustments too often responding to random variation
d
8. If the means for sample 1 to 4 for a process are, 12.67, 22.32, 14.53, 12.11; what value will be the center line of x chart indicating?
a) 15.2
b) 15.4
c) 14.8
d) 14.9
b
CL=\(\bar{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sum \bar{x}}{N}\)=15.4
9. A permanent change in the sample size is made only because of cost or because has exhibited good stability and fewer resources are allocated for process monitoring.
a) True
b) False
a
10. Which of these should be plotted on the x bar chart?
a) Counts
b) Defects
c) Problems Solved
d) Measurements
d
