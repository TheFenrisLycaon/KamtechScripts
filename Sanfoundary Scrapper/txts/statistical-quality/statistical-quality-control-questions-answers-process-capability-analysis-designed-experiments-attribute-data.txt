1. In the design of experiments, the ____________ variables are adjusted first.
a) Output controllable
b) Output uncontrollable
c) Input uncontrollable
d) Input controllable
d
2. Which of these can be varied?
a) Input Controllable variables
b) Input uncontrollable variables
c) Output controllable variables
d) Output uncontrollable variables
a
3. Which of the following is not done in the designing of experiments?
a) Varying the input variables (controllable)
b) Observation of the output
c) Making a relationship between input and output
d) Process control
d
4. Which of these is not a function of designing of experiments?
a) To find the set of process variables influential on output
b) To determine the optimum level of the variables
c) To estimate maximum output possible with optimum value of variables
d) To eliminate some uncontrollable inputs
d
5. Which of these is the easiest method for finding the sources of variability?
a) Designed Experiments
b) p-charts
c) n-charts
d) Acceptance sampling
a
6. Which of these is not a method to judge the process capability?
a) Control charts
b) Attributes data
c) Acceptance sampling
d) Designed experiments
b
7. DPU is ________
a) Decrement per unit
b) Defects per unit
c) Design per unit
d) Decimals per unit
b
8. DPMO stands for ________
a) Defects per million opportunities
b) Decrement per minute opportunity
c) Defects per minute opportunity
d) Designation per million opportunities
a
9. Which of these is the correct formula to calculate DPMO which uses the number of opportunities?
a) DPMO=\(\frac{Total\, number \,of \,units}{Number\, of \,units \,* 0.5 *\, Number\, of \,Opportunities}\) 
b) DPMO=\(\frac{Total\, number \,of \,units}{Number \,of \,units \,* \,3Number\, of \,Opportunities}\) 
c) DPMO=\(\frac{Total\, number \,of \,units}{Number \,of \,units \,* \,2Number \,of \,Opportunities}\) 
d) DPMO=\(\frac{Total\, number \,of \,units}{Number \,of \,units \,* \,Number \,of \,Opportunities}\) 
d
DPMO=\(\frac{Total\, number \,of \,units}{Number \,of \,units \,* \,Number \,of \,Opportunities}\) 
As this formula contains the number of opportunities, it takes the number of times that an error can be occurred. So it is much accurate.
10. If there are 85 defects in the lot containing 150 units, what is the value of DPU?
a) 0.45
b) 0.57
c) 0.89
d) 1.52
b
DPU =  \(\frac{Total \,number \,of \,defects}{Total \,number \,of \,units}\) 
By calculating the DPU, we get, DPU=0.57.
11. If the DPMO for a sample containing 45 units is 0.237. If the total number of defects is 32, what will be the number of opportunities?
a) 3
b) 1
c) 6
d) 7
a
DPMO=\(\frac{Total\, number \,of \,units}{Number \,of \,units \,* \,Number \,of \,Opportunities}\) 
Putting the values, we get, the number of opportunities= 3.
12. PPM defectives can be a measure of the process capability. Although an equivalent sigma level can also be used.
a) True
b) False
a
13. DPU can be evaluated only when the variable data is available.
a) True
b) False
b
