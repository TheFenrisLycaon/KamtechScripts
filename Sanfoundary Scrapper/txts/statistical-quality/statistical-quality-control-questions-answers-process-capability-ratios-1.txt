6. How is s (Sample standard deviation) calculated?
a) s = R/2
b) s = R/2d2
c) s = R/d2
d) s = 2R/d2
c
s = R/d2.
7. The estimate of the Cp is calculated by ______________
a) \(\frac{USL-LSL}{6\hat{\sigma}}\) 
b) \(\frac{USL-LSL}{3\hat{\sigma}}\) 
c) \(\frac{USL-LSL}{\hat{\sigma}}\) 
d) \(\frac{USL-LSL}{12\hat{\sigma}}\) 
a
\(\widehat{C_P} = \frac{USL-LSL}{6\hat{\sigma}}\)
8. If the estimate of the process standard deviation is 0.1368, and the USL for the quality characteristic is 2.00, and the LSL=2.00, what will be the value of the estimate of PCR Cp is _____________
a) 1.21
b) 1.19
c) 1.13
d) 1.31
b
\(\widehat{C_P} = \frac{USL-LSL}{6\hat{\sigma}}\) 
So, when we put values, we get, \(\widehat{C_P}\)=1.192.
9. The percentage of the specification band used by the process is calculated by formula _______________
a) P=Cp
b) P=\(\frac{1}{C_p}\)*100
c) P=Cp*100
d) P=\(\frac{1}{C_p}\) 
b
P=\(\frac{1}{C_p}\)*100
10. If the process capability ratio Cp is 1.532, what percentages of the specification band will be used by the process?
a) 65.27%
b) 75.11%
c) 44.21%
d) 21.42%
a
P=\(\frac{1}{C_p}\)*100
When we put values, we get,  P=65.27%.
11. The one sided process capability ratio that uses the USL of the quality characteristic, is written as ____
a) \(C_{pu}=\frac{USL+μ}{3σ}\) 
b) \(C_{pu}=\frac{USL+μ}{6σ}\) 
c) \(C_{pu}=\frac{USL-μ}{6σ}\) 
d) \(C_{pu}=\frac{USL-μ}{3σ}\) 
d
\(C_{pu}=\frac{USL-μ}{3σ}\)
12. For a process, the process standard deviation is 32. If the mean of the process is 364, and the upper specification limit is 400, what will be the one side process capability ratio which uses USL of the quality characteristic?
a) 1.242
b) 1.135
c) 1.125
d) 0.991
c
\(C_{pu}=\frac{USL-μ}{3σ}\) 
Putting values, we get, Cpu=1.125.
13. What is the formula to calculate the one sided process capability which uses lower specification limit?
a) \(C_{pl}=\frac{μ+LSL}{σ}\) 
b) \(C_{pl}=\frac{μ-LSL}{6σ}\) 
c) \(C_{pl}=\frac{μ-LSL}{3σ}\) 
d) \(C_{pl}=\frac{μ-LSL}{6σ}\) 
c
\(C_{pl}=\frac{μ-LSL}{3σ}\)
14. Process capability ratio Cp cannot be zero.
a) True
b) False
a
15. Increase in process capability ratio Cp states that there is an increase in the percentage of the specification band used.
a) True
b) False
b
P=\(\frac{1}{C_p}\)*100
So an increase in the PCR Cp shows a decrease in the percentage of the specification band used.
