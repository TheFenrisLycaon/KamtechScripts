1. If the Lower specification limit for one quality characteristic of one product, is 200, and the mean of the process is estimated to be 264 with an estimate of one sided process capability ratio \(\widehat{C_{pl}}\), what will be the estimate of the process standard deviation?
a) 43
b) 59
c) 32
d) 18
c
We know that,
\(\widehat{C_{pl}} = \frac{\hat{μ}-LSL}{3\hat{σ}}\) 
Putting values, we get, The process standard deviation estimate, \(\hat{σ}\)=32.
2. If the LSL of the quality characteristic increases, the process capability ratio Cp will ____________
a) Increase
b) Decrease
c) Will remain same
d) Can’t say (can increase as well as decrease)
b
\(C_p=\frac{USL-LSL}{6σ}\) 
So an increase in the LSL value will decrease the PCR.
3. PCR is a measure of __________
a) The ability of the process to manufacture the products that meet the specifications
b) The ability of the operator to remove the variability
c) The probability of the mean to be equal to the USL
d) The probability of the mean to be equal to the LSL
a
4. The process fallout (in ppm) ___________ with increase in the process capability ratio Cp, for a normally distributed process.
a) Increases
b) Decreases
c) Remains same
d) Can’t be described an increase or decrease
b
5. A PCR Cp=1.00 indicates the fallout rate of ___________ ppm for two-sided specifications.
a) 2
b) 7
c) 967
d) 2700
d
6. A process capability ratio Cp=____________ indicates the fallout rate of 1 ppm for one-sided specifications for a normally distributed process.
a) 1.2
b) 1.8
c) 1.9
d) 1.6
d
7. A correct interpretation of the PCR Cp does not need the consideration of ___________ of process.
a) Operator
b) Mean
c) Variance
d) Stability
a
8. What is generally the minimum value of two sided specification PCR Cp for a existing process?

a) 1.45
b) 1.19
c) 1.72
d) 1.5
a
10. If the quality characteristic in consideration is a strength parameter of the existing process, what will be the minimum value of Cp for two sided specifications for this?
a) 1.22
b) 1.52
c) 1.50
d) 1.36
c
11. Which of these is a necessary assumption made for the calculation of the PCR Cp?
a) The quality characteristic has a normal distribution
b) The quality characteristic has a lognormal distribution
c) The quality characteristic has an exponential distribution
d) The quality characteristic has a Poisson distribution
a
12. What is the minimum two – sided specification PCR for the safety parameter for a new process?
a) 1.48
b) 1.45
c) 1.67
d) 1.32
c
13. What is the value of process fallout in defectives ppm for one sided specifications of a PCR Cp= 1.10?
a) 484
b) 201
c) 2700
d) 100
a
14. For calculating the PCR Cp, the process should be in statistical control.
a) True
b) False
a
