1. In the name of the OC curve, OC stands for ________
a) Operation Characteristic
b) Operating Characteristic
c) Operator Characteristic
d) Operated Characteristic
b
2. The general theory of Control charts was first developed by ________
a) Walter A. Shewhart
b) Deming
c) ISO
d) ASQC
a
3. Control charts are the part of _______ step of DMAIC process.
a) Define
b) Measure
c) Act
d) Control
d
4. The size of sample is 5 for a process. If the process standard deviation is 0.15 micron, and the mean of process is 1.5 micron, the standard deviation of the sample average will be _______
a) 0.0500
b) 0.1000
c) 0.6710
d) 0.0671
d
σx=σ/√n
Putting σ=0.15, n=5, we get, σx=0.0671.
5. For a process, sample size=5, process standard deviation=0.15, mean=1.5, and the std. deviation of mean is 0.0671. What will be the value of 3σ upper control limit for the construction of control chart?
a) 1.70
b) 1.29
c) 1.92
d) 0.170
a
So, UCL3σ=1.5+3(0.0671)=1.7013.
6. The correct expression for UCL for construction of a control chart is given by _____
a) UCL = \(\overline{x} + Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} (\sigma_x)\) 
b) UCL = \(\overline{x} – Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} (\sigma)\) 
c) UCL = \(\overline{x} – Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} (\sigma_x)\) 
d) UCL = \(\overline{x} + Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} (\sigma)\) 
a
UCL = \(\overline{x} + Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} (\sigma_x)\); where \(\overline{x}\) is the mean of process, σx is the std. deviation of mean and \(Z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\) is a arbitrary constant.
7. The general model for the lower control limit for a value of quality characteristic “w” will be _____
a) LCL = μw + Lσw
b) LCL = μw – Lσ
c) LCL = μw – Lσw
d) LCL = μw + Lσ
c
LCL = μw – Lσw;
Where “L” denotes the distance of control limits from the center line.
8. The center line of a control chart will be having a value ______
a) Higher than mean of quality characteristic
b) Lower than mean of quality characteristic
c) Equal to mean of quality characteristic
d) Which is higher than UCL
c
9. Which of these is a part of corrective action process associated with a control chart?
a) OCAP
b) DMAIC
c) OC curve
d) LCL
a
10. Which of these can be used to estimate capability of the process?
a) Control charts
b) Process mean
c) Acceptance Sampling
d) Designed Experiments
a
11. Control charts for central tendency and the variability are called _________ control charts.
a) Variables
b) Attributes
c) Acceptance
d) Rejections
a
12. The control charts formed for judgment of conformities and non-conformities are called ______ control charts.
a) Variables
b) Attributes
c) Acceptance
d) Rejections
b
13. Control charts with points around mean and in predicted or fixed manner indicate ________
a) Stationary variability
b) Non-stationary variability
c) Auto correlated variability
d) Process out of control
a
14. Auto correlated stationary process data is dependent on each other.
a) True
b) False
a
15. Control charts are not effective in defect prevention.
a) True
b) False
b
