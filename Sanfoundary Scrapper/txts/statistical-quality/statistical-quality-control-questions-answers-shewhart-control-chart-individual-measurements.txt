b) The moving range
c) The mean of moving ranges
d) The process standard deviation
a
7. The value of ARL for any x bar control chart having 3-σ limits is __________
a) 482
b) 310
c) 370
d) 270
c
\(ARL=\frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{0.0027}=370\)
8. The average number of points that must be plotted before an out-of-control point is plotted on an Individuals control chart?
a) ARL
b) ATS
c) MTBF
d) Hazard rate
a
9. The ARL for any individuals control chart with the 1 sigma limits, and the β=0.972, is ____
a) 2
b) 6.3
c) 43.96
d) 13
c
ARL=\(\frac{1}{1-\beta}\) 
Putting the values of β=0.9772, we get ARL=43.96.
10. Which of this stands correct for the relation between the ARL for a shewhart control chart and the individual control chart ARL?
a) ARLindividual control chart=1/ ARLshewhart control chart
b) ARLindividual control chart= ARLshewhart control chart
c) ARLindividual control chart≪ARLshewhart control chart
d) ARLindividual control chart≫ ARLshewhart control chart
c
11. What is the correct expression for average moving range for any individuals control chart?
a) \(\overline{MR} = \sum_{i=2}^m \frac{MR_i}{m-1}\) 
b) \(\overline{MR} = \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{MR_i}{m}\) 
c) \(\overline{MR} = \sum_{i=2}^{m-1} \frac{MR_i}{m-1}\) 
d) \(\overline{MR} = \sum_{i=1}^m \frac{MR_i}{m-1}\) 
a
\(\overline{MR} = \sum_{i=2}^m \frac{MR_i}{m-1}\)
12. The estimator of the process standard deviation for any individuals control chart is written as?
a) \(\frac{\overline{MR}}{2}\) 
b) \(\overline{MR}/0.8865\) 
c) \(\overline{MR}/1.128\) 
d) \(1.128\overline{MR}\) 
c
\(\widehat{σ_1}=\overline{MR}/d_2\) 
For individuals control chart, n=2. For n=2, we have d2=1.128. So we get,
\(\widehat{σ_1}=\overline{MR}/1.128\).
13. The estimation of the process standard deviation for any individuals control chart is expressed as ____ in the terms of sample standard deviation.
a) \(\widehat{σ_2}=\frac{s}{c_4}\) 
b) \(\widehat{σ_2}=\frac{s}{c_1}\) 
c) \(\widehat{σ_2}=\frac{s}{c_2}\) 
d) \(\widehat{σ_2}=\frac{s}{c_3}\) 
a
14. Moving range can only be calculated by the two successive observations.
a) True
b) False
b
15. “\(\widehat{σ_3} = 1.047\overline{MR}\); where \(\overline{MR}\) is the median of the span-two moving ranges.”
a) True
b) False
a
\(\widehat{σ_3} = 1.047\overline{MR}\)
