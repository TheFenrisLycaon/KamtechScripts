1. Which of these is the correct expansion of DNOM?
a) Deviation from Lognormal
b) Derived from normal
c) Deviation from normal
d) Deviation from normality
c
2. Which of these is used as a technique for process control for short production runs?
a) Using deviation from nominal to plot the control chart
b) Using the variable value to plot the control chart
c) Using the variable change to plot the control chart
d) Using the variable decrease or increase to plot the chart
a
3. If the Mi is the actual sample measurement, and TA is a nominal value, what will be the DNOM?
a) xi = Mi – 2TA
b) xi = Mi – TA
c) xi = 2TA – Mi
d) xi = TA + Mi
b
xi = Mi – TA.
4. The mean of the variable measured is replaced by the mean of ________ value in the case of the DNOM chart.
a) Normal value
b) Deviation from normal
c) Range
d) Deviation from normal range
b
5. If in a manufacturing process, the measurements for a certain dimension for a part are, 50, 51 and 52; where the nominal value of the dimension measured is 50, what will be the DNOM mean?
a) 1.0
b) 50
c) 51
d) 0.33
a
xi = Mi – TA
By putting values, we get DNOM’s 0, 1 and 2. The mean DNOM will be 1.0.
6. How many samples are generally taken before calculating the control limits for the DNOM x bar and R charts?
a) 10
b) 40
c) 35
d) 20
d
7. Which of these assumptions are made while using the DNOM approach?
a) The process standard deviation is same for all parts
b) The process standard deviation is different for all parts
c) The samples size is variable
d) The sample size is 1
a
8. Which of these is true for DNOM approach?
a) The sample size is variable
b) The process standard deviation is different for all parts
c) The sample size varies from one part to another
d) The sample size remains same for all parts
d
9. What is used instead of Nominal values when the nominal value is not given in the case of DNOM approach?
a) Historical process standard deviation
b) New standard deviation
c) Historical process average
d) Historical process variance
c
10. Which of these does not need to have the nominal value specified frequently?
a) When part has two-sided specifications
b) When part has one-sided specifications
c) When the part can’t have one sided specifications
d) When the part has either one-sided or two sided specifications
b
11. Standard hypothesis testing procedures are used to compare __________ process average to a desired process target to determine whether the process mean is different from the target.
a) New
b) Historical
c) Correct
d) Disturbed
b
12. Which of these will work correctly and efficiently, when the process standard deviations are different for different part numbers?
a) Standardized x bar and R charts
b) Standardized attribute charts
c) DNOM charts
d) Both, the cusum and EWMA charts
a
13. Standardized R chart which uses control limits D3 and D4 has the value of \(R_i^s\) = _________
a) \(R_i^s=\frac{3R_i}{R_j}\) 
b) \(R_i^s=\frac{R_i}{2R_j}\) 
c) \(R_i^s=\frac{2R_i}{R_j}\) 
d) \(R_i^s=\frac{R_i}{R_j}\) 
d
\(R_i^s=\frac{R_i}{R_j}\)
14. Deviation from the process target charts work efficiently when the process standard deviation is not same.
a) True
b) False
b
15. Sample size is allowed to vary for the construction of the DNOM based control charts.
a) True
b) False
b
