c) \(\frac{2σ}{μ}\) 
d) \(\frac{2μ}{σ}\)

d
13. Which of these is correct target value for standardized control chart for fraction nonconforming for shorter production runs?
a) p
b) np
c) c
d) R̅
a
14. The standardized control chart approach for short production runs can only be applied on variable control charts.
a) True
b) False
b
15. The DNOM approach does not need the measurements to be taken at all.
a) True
b) False
b
xi=Mi-TA
Where Mi  stands for the measurements of the dimension. So to calculate DNOM value we need to have the value of the dimension measured.
