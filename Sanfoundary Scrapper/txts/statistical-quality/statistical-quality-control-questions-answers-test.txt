1. The display of possible outcomes of an event with their corresponding probabilities is called ____________
a) Probability Plot
b) Contingency table
c) Bayesian Table
d) Frequency Plot
a
2. Which one of these is not one of the conditions for the binomial distribution?
a) Only two outcomes must be there for an event
b) Independent trials must be there
c) Trials must be more than 4
d) The probability of failure must be constant
c
3. For mean=7 and standard deviation=2, what will be probability that a variable, which follows normal distribution, will have a value less than or equal to 10?
a) 0.93319
b) 0.94520
c) 0.96409
d) 0.91924
a
So, P[x≤10]=P[z≤\(\frac{10-7}{2}\)]= P[z≤1.5]=φ[1.5]=0.93319.
4. The variance of lognormal distribution is given by ____
a) σ2 = e2θ+w (\(e^{w^{2}}\)-1)
b) σ2 = e2θ+w2 (ew-1)
c) σ2 = e2θ+w2 (\(e^{w^{2}}\)-1)
d) σ2 = e2θ+w2 (\(e^{w^{2}}\)-2)
c
σ2= e2θ+w2 (ew2-1).
5. The relationship between the mean and variance of the exponential distribution is expressed by _____
a) μ = λσ2
b) μ = σ2/λ
c) σ2=λ2 μ
d) σ2=μ/λ2
a
So, for an exponential distribution,  μ = λσ2.
6. (1-e-λa) is the cumulative ______ distribution.
a) Gamma
b) Normal
c) Lognormal
d) Exponential
d
F(a)=(1-e-λa).
7. The exponential distribution is used in reliability engineering as a model of the time to failure of a system. The parameter λ is called _____ in this application.
a) Failure rate
b) MTF
c) Hazard rate
d) MTBF
a
8. The mean of the exponential distribution used in reliability engineering is used as mean time to failure.
a) True
b) False
a
9. The mean of the gamma distribution is given by _________
a) μ=1/λ
b) μ=r/λ
c) μ=r2/λ
d) μ=1/r
b
μ=r/λ
Where r and λ are the shape parameter and the scale parameter, respectively.
10. Exponential distribution is a special case of gamma distribution.
a) True
b) False
a
11. The relationship between the mean and the standard deviation of the gamma distribution is given as _____
a) \(\frac{\mu}{\sigma} = \sqrt{r}\) 
b) \(\frac{\mu}{\sigma} = r\) 
c) \(\frac{\mu}{\sigma} = r^2\) 
d) \(\frac{\mu}{\sigma} = \sqrt[3]{r}\) 
a
\(\frac{\mu}{\sigma} = \sqrt{r}\).
12. If the shape parameter of the gamma distribution is twice the scale parameter, what will be the value of the mean of the distribution?
a) 1.5
b) 2
c) 4
d) 1
b
μ=2λ⁄λ=2.
13. For an exponential distribution, what is the probability that the value of the exponential random variable with parameter λ=3.2; will be having a value higher than 0.2353?
a) 0.5290
b) 0.4710
c) 0.2213
d) 0.3452
b
14. Which of these will not be distributed on a discrete distribution?
a) The number of houses in a colony
b) The number of bedrooms in a house
c) The number of scratches on a car hood
d) The diameter of a car tire
d
15. For a variable distributed log-normally with θ=6, ω=1.2; what is the probability that the variable exceeds a value of 500?
a) 0.4290
b) 0.5710
c) 0.4990
d) 0.4937
a
P[x > a]=1-P[x≤a]=1-P[z≤\(\frac{ln⁡(a)-θ}{ω}\)] 
Putting the values of θ and ω we get,
P[x>500]=0.4290.
