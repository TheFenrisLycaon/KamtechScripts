1. When the sample size is variable, which one of these can be used to evaluate the value of x double bar?
a) \( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m n_i \bar{x_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^n n_i}\) 
b) \( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n n_i \bar{x_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^m n_i}\) 
c) \( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n n_i \bar{x_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^n n_i}\) 
d) \( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m n_i \bar{x_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^m n_i}\) 
d
\( \bar{\bar{x}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m n_i \bar{x_i}}{\sum_{i=1}^m n_i}\)
2. Which one of these is correct to evaluate the mean standard deviation of the process samples?
a) \(\bar{s} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m (n_i-1) s_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^m n_i}\) 
b) \(\bar{s} = \left[\frac{\sum_{i=1}^m (n_i-1) s_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^m n_i-m}\right]^2\) 
c) \(\bar{s} = \left[\frac{\sum_{i=1}^m (n_i-1) s_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^m n_i-m}\right]^{1/2}\) 
d) \(\bar{s} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^m (n_i-1) s_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^m n_i-m}\) 
c
\(\bar{s} = \left[\frac{\sum_{i=1}^m (n_i-1) s_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^m n_i-m}\right]^{1/2}\)
