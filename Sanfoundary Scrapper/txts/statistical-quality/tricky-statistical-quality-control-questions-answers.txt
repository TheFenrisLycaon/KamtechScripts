1. The largest standard deviation of the sample mean from the target, not leading to an immediate out-of-control signal, is called _______________ of a control chart.
a) ARL
b) UCL
c) Signal resolution
d) Signal resistance
d
2. For a Shewhart control chart, what is the value of SR?
a) Zα/2
b) 2
c) L
d) 2L
c
SR(x)=L
Where L is the multiplier used to obtain the control limits.
3. Which of these is a having a constant SR?
a) A x chart
b) A Cusum chart
c) An EWMA chart
d) Every control chart
a
4. Which of these is not having a constant SR value?
a) c-chart
b) R-chart
c) p-chart
d) EWMA chart
d
5. What is the value of SR for an EWMA chart?
a) SR(EWMA)=\(\frac{L\sqrt{\frac{λ}{2-λ}}+(λ-1)w}{λ}\) 
b) SR(EWMA)=\(\frac{L\sqrt{\frac{λ}{2-λ}}-(1-λ)w}{λ}\) 
c) SR(EWMA)=\(\frac{L\sqrt{\frac{λ}{2-λ}}-(λ-1)w}{λ}\) 
d) SR(EWMA)=\(\frac{L\sqrt{\frac{λ}{2-λ}}+(1-λ)w}{λ}\) 
b
SR(EWMA)=\(\frac{L\sqrt{\frac{λ}{2-λ}}-(1-λ)w}{λ}\)
6. What is the value of the term “w” called in the SR value of a EWMA chart?
a) First EWMA value
b) Last EWMA value
c) Value of EWMA statistic
d) Weight average
c
SR(EWMA)=\(\frac{L\sqrt{\frac{λ}{2-λ}}-(1-λ)w}{λ}\) 
Here, w is called the value of EWMA statistic.
7. Which of these is the maximum value of the SR averaged over all values of EWMA statistic?
a) \(SR_{max} (EWMA)=L \frac{(2-λ)}{λ}\) 
b) \(SR_{max}(EWMA)=L\sqrt{\frac{(2-λ)}{λ}}\) 
c) \(SR_{max} (EWMA)=L+\sqrt{\frac{(2-λ)}{λ}}\) 
d) \(SR_{max} (EWMA)=L-\sqrt{\frac{(2-λ)}{λ}}\) 
b
\(SR_{max}(EWMA)=L\sqrt{\frac{(2-λ)}{λ}}\)
8. Small values of λ gives ______ values of the SR (EWMA).
a) Larger
b) Lower
c) Equal
d) Both, larger and smaller
a
SR(EWMA)=\(\frac{L\sqrt{\frac{λ}{2-λ}}-(1-λ)w}{λ}\) 
We get the inference that, SR(EWMA)∝1/λ, so SR(EWMA) will be larger for smaller values of λ.
9. Which of these methods can be used to counteract the signal resistance in case of small values of λ with EWMA charts?
a) To use a cusum chart paralleled
b) To use a Shewhart control chart paralleled
c) To just wait for EWMA chart to be plotted till 50 observations
d) To increase the value of process mean target
b
10. Who were the first persons to recommend the use of Shewhart control charts with the EWMA charts with low values of λ?
a) Woodall and Mahmoud
b) Woodall and Roberts
c) Roberts and Mahmoud
d) Roberts and Crowder
a
11. Which of these is not an advantage of using a Shewhart control chart with the EWMA chart?
a) Detection of larger process shifts
b) ARL adjustment
c) Counteraction to the high signal resistance value
d) No defects
d
12. Which of these is not an advantage of low value of λ in the case of EWMA charts?
a) Good ARL performance
b) Insensitivity to the normality of the data
c) Good ability to detect the larger process shifts
d) Easy detection of small process shifts
d
13. In the case of Shewhart charts, if the data is not according to the normal distribution, the actual in-control ARL (ARL0) will be ____________ the expected value.
a) Considerably higher than
b) Considerably lower than
c) Equal to
d) Almost equal to
b
14. The signal resistance value depends on the value chosen for λ.
a) True
b) False
a
SR(EWMA)=\(\frac{L\sqrt{\frac{λ}{2-λ}}-(1-λ)w}{λ}\) 
Here the value of L and w are constants. So the value of SR (EWMA) depends only on the value of the λ.
15. The EWMA charts are recommended for phase II applications as it is totally a nonparametric procedure.
a) True
b) False
a
