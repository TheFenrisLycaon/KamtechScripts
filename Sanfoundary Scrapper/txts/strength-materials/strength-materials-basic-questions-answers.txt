1. A beam has a triangular cross-section, having altitude ”h” and base “b”. If the section is being subjected to a shear force “F”. Calculate the shear stress at the level of neutral axis in the cross section.
a) 4F/5bh
b) 4F/3bh
c) 8F/3bh
d) 3F/4bh
c
= 4/3 × average shear stress
= 4/3 × F/A/2 ;     A = bh
= 8F/3bh.
2. The maximum shear stress in the rectangular section is ______________ times the average shear stress.
a) 3/4
b) 3/7
c) 5/3
d) 3/2
d
Maximum shear stress = 3/2 × F/bd    (• Average shear stress = F/bd ).
                                          = 3/2 × average shear stress.
3.The modular ratio for M20 grade concrete is _____________
a) 16
b) 13
c) 11
d) 07
b
Modular ratio  (m) = 280/21 = 13.33.
4. In doubly reinforced beam, the maximum shear stress occurs ______________
a) along the centroid
b) along the neutral axis
c) on the planes between neutral axis and tensile reinforcement
d) on the planes between neutral axis and compressive reinforcement
d
For continuous beams,  the maximum shear stress occurs at the planes intersecting the compressive reinforcement and  the neutral axis.
5. A cylindrical section having no joint is known as _______________
a) Proof section
b) Seamless section
c) Target section
d) Mown section
b
6. The efficiency of cylindrical section is the ratio of the strength of joint to the strength of _______________
a) Solid plate
b) Boilerplate
c) Circumferential plate
d) Longitudinal plate
a
7. Calculate the modulus of section for a hollow circular column of external diameter 60 mm and 10 mm thickness.
a) 170 m
b) 190 m
c) 250 m
d) 300 m
a
D = 60 mm ; t = 10 mm   &  d = 60 – 2×10  = 40 mm
For hollow circular section,  modulus of section( Z ) =  3.14 × D4 – d4 / 32 D.
                                                                                             = 17016.3 mm = 170 m.
8. Determine the modulus of a section for an I section,  given the distance from neutral axis is 50 mm and moment of inertia is 2.8×106 mm4.
a) 59m
b) 51m
c) 58m
d) 63m
c
Given y = 50 mm
            I = 2.8×106 mm4.
       &  Z =  I/y = 2.8×106  / 50
               = 57.76 ×103 mm
               = 57.7 ~ 58 m.
9. A  circular Beam of 0.25 m diameter is subjected to you shear force of 10 kN. Calculate the value of maximum shear stress. [Take area = 176 m2].
a) 0.75 N/mm2
b) 0.58 N/mm2
c) 0.73 N/mm2
d) 0.65 N/mm2
a
Area (A) = 176 m2
Shear Force (F) = 10 kN  ~ 10000 N.
For circular cross section the maximum shear stress is equal to 4/3 times of average shear stress
Maximum shear force = 4/3 × F/A
                                         = 4/3 × 10000/176
                                         = 0.75 N/mm2.
10. The maximum shear stress distribution is _____________ percentage more than average shear stress in circular section.
a) 54 %
b) 60 %
c) 33 %
d) 50 %
c
Maximum shear stress = 16/3 × average shear stress
But 4F / A is the average shear stress.
So, the maximum shear stress = 4/3 times the average shear stress.
Hence the maximum shear stress is 33% more than the average shear stress in a circular section.
