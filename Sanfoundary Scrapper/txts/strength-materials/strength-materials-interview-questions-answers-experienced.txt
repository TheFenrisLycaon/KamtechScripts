b) 0.9
c) 0.58
d) 0.73
b
Where k= 0.289
j = 1-0.289/3
  = 0.904~0.9.

a) 9.21×106mm4
b) 9.45×106mm4
c) 9.37×106 mm4
d) 8.51×106 mm4
c
h = 150 mm
Moment of inertia about centroid Axis = bh3 / 36.
                                                                      = 100 ×1503/ 36
                                                                      = 9.37×106mm4.
