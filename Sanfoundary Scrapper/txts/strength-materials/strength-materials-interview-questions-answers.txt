1. A circular rod of dia 30 mm and length 200mm is extended to 0.09mm length and 0.0045 diameters through a tensile force. What will be its Poissons ratio?
a) 0.30
b) 0.31
c) 0.32
d) 0.33
d
                   = δD/D x L/δL
                   = 0.0045/30 x 200/0.09
                   = 0.33.
2. The Poissons ratio of a material is 0.3. what will be the ratio of Youngs modulus to bulk modulus?
a) 1.4
b) 1.2
c) 0.8
d) 0.6
b
So  E/K  =  3(1-2×0.3)  =  1.2.
3. What is the bulk modulus of elasticity?
a) The ratio of shear stress to shear strain
b) The ratio of direct stress to direct strain
c) The ratio of volumetric stress to volumetric strain
d) The ratio of direct stress to volumetric strain
d
4. For a material, Youngs modulus is given as 1.2 x 105 and Poissons ratio 1/4. Calculate the bulk modulus.
a) 0.7 x 105
b) 0.8 x 105
c) 1.2 x 105
d) 1.2 x 105
b
                                      = 1.2 x 105/3(1 – 2/4)
                                      = 0.8 x 105.
5. Determine the Poissons ratio and bulk modulus of a material, for which Youngs modulus is 1.2 and modulus of rigidity is 4.8.
a) 7
b) 8
c) 9
d) 10
b
μ= 0.25
                 K  = E / 3(1 – 2μ)
                    = 8.
6. The Youngs modulus of elasticity of a material is 2.5 times its modulus of rigidity. Then what will be its Poissons ratio?
a) 0.25
b) 0.33
c) 0.50
d) 0.60
a
7. How the elastic constants E and K are related?
a) E = 2K(1 – 2μ)
b) E = 3K(1 – 2μ)
c) E = 2K(1 – μ)
d) E = K(1 – 2μ)
b
8. How many elastic constants does an isotropic, homogeneous and linearly elastic material have?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
9. The modulus of rigidity and the modulus of elasticity of a material are 80 GPa and 200 GPa. What will be the Poissons ratio of the material?

b) 0.30
c) 0.40
d) 0.50
a
