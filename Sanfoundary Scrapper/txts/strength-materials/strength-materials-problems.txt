a) 1500 mm4
b) 1650 mm4
c) 1666 mm4
d) 1782 mm4
c
                                                                  = 5x10x10x10/3
                                                                  = 1666.66 mm4.

b) 379mm4
c) 416mm4
d) 500mm4
c
                                                                    = 5x10x10x10/12
                                                                     = 416.67 mm4.
9. What will be the moment of inertia of the given triangle about the base?
a) 20.33 mm4
b) 21.33 mm4
c) 24.33 mm4
d) 22.33 mm4
b
                                             = 4x4x4x4/12
                                              = 21.33 mm4.
10. What will be the moment of inertia of the given triangle about an axis passing through C.G and parallel to base?
a) 6.1 mm4
b) 7.1 mm4
c) 8.1 mm4
d) 7.56 mm4
b
                                                   =  4x4x4x4/36
                                                   = 7.11 mm4. 
11. What will be the difference between MOI of two triangle sections is in 1st, MOI is taken about its base and in 2nd MOI is taken about its centroid?
a) bh3/12
b) bh3/18
c) bh3/36
d) bh3/24
b
      The moment of inertia of a triangular section about an axis passing through C.G. is bh3/36
      So the difference = bh3/12 – bh3/36 = bh3/18.
