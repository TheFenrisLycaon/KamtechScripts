1. A beam which is inbuilt in at its support is called _________
a) Cantilever beam
b) Simply supported beam
c) Fixed beam
d) Continuous beam
c
2. Fixed beam is also known as _______
a) Encaster beam
b) Constressed beam
c) In built beam
d) Constricted beam
a
3. In fixed beams, the slope at the supports be ___________
a) Minimum
b) Zero
c) Maximum
d) Throughout
b
Maximum bending moment at the centre is reduced because of fixing moments developed at supports.
4. _______ changes induce large stresses in a fixed beam.
a) Lateral
b) Deflection
c) Temperature
d) Slope
c
5. A beam 6 metres long is fixed at it ends. It carries a udl of 5 kN/m. Find the maximum bending moment in the beam.
a) 15 kNm
b) 20 kNm
c) 35 kNm
d) 40 kNm
a
= 5×62 / 12.
15 kNm.
6. Calculate the maximum deflection of a fixed beam carrying udl of 5 kN/m. The span of beam is 6 m. Take E = 200kN/m2 and I = 5×107 mm4.
a) 1.865 m
b) 2.235 m
c) 1.6875 m
d) 2.5 m
c
= 5×64 × 109/ 384×200×5×107
= 1.6875 mm.
7. Calculate the load intensity of fixed beam if the maximum deflection shall not exceed 1/ 400 of the span. Take EI as 1010 kN mm2.
a) 40 kN
b) 35 kN
c) 45 kN
d) 60 kN
c
Wl4/ 384 EI = 1 /400.
W= 384 EI / 400 l3
W = 45 kN.
8.  ____ is known as a serpentine curve.
a) Circular curve

d) Leminiscate curve
c
9. The maximum super elevation to be provided is ___
a) 2 in 15
b) 1 in 15
c) 1 in 10
d) 2 in 10
b
10. ______ curves are used to solve the problems of land acquisition.
a) Vertical curves
b) Horizontal curves
c) Circular curves
d) Transition curves
b
