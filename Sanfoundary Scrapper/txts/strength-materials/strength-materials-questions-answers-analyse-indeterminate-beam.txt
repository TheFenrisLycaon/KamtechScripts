b) Orificemeter
c) Hydraulic lift
d) Pitot tube
c
7. Pascal’s law is applied in ____________
a) Pitot tube
b) Hydraulic lift
c) Orificemeter
d) Venturimeter
b
8. Which of the following devices measures the velocity of flow?
a) Pitot tube
b) Venturimeter
c) Orificemeter
d) Hydraulic jacks
a
9. Which of the following is the coefficient of pitot tube?
a) 0.96
b) 0.98
c) 0.97
d) 0.95
b
Where Cv = coefficient of pitot tube = 0.98
               h= difference between liquid levels in the pitot tube and piezometer.
10. Bernoulli’s equation is applicable only for ___________ flow.
a) Rotational
b) Steady
c) Compressible
d) Unsteady
b
11. Flow of water when a tap is just open is an example of __________ flow.
a)  Uniform
b) Steady
c) Un steady
d) Turbulent
c
12. A Straight cantilever of uniform area carries a udl over its entire length. If the free end of a cantilever is now prop at the level of the fixed end, the vertical force required at the prop be __________
a) 3/4 W
b) 3/8 W
c) 5/8 W
d) W
b
Wl3/8EI = B×l3 / 3EI
Reaction at B = 3W/8.
13. ____________ is used to empty a tank of water having no outlet.
a) Venacontracta
b) Syphon
c) Summit
d) Dyne
b
 They also used to supply water to a town over a ridge and supply type of water having an outlet.
14. Find out the elongation of a tie of 2m long, if the axial rigidity is 5000 × 104 mm2. The axial pull be 20 kN.
a) 0.8 mm
b) 0.6 mm
c) 0.5 mm
d) 1mm
a
Elongation : Pl/ AE
Change in length = PL/ AE
                               = 20×10/500×11÷103.
