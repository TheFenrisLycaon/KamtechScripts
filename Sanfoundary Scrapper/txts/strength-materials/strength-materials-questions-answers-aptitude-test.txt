4. Calculate the Strain energy that can be stored in a body to be pulled with 100 N/mm2 stress (f) and E = 2×105 N/mm2.
a) 0.9 kNm
b) 0.05kNm
c) 0.87kNm
d) 0.54kNm
b
                                                                = 1002/ 2×2×105
                                                                                               = 0.05 kNm.

10. To what radius a silver strip 200 mm wide and 40 mm thick can be bent if the maximum stress in the ship is 80 N/mm2. Young’s modulus for Silver is 80×103 N/mm2.
a) 20m
b) 30m
c) 15m
d) 35m
a
y = 40/2 = 20 mm
f = 80N/mm2
From the relation; E/R = f/y
R = E×y / f
    = 80000×20 / 80
    = 20000mm = 20m.
