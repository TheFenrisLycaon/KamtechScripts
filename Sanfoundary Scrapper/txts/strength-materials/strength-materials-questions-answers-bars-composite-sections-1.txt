a) 2.55mm
b) 3.15mm
c) 2.45mm
d) 2.65mm
a
       P = 10x 1000N,   L = 1m,  A = πd2/4 = 1.963 x 10-5 m2, E = 200 x 109 N/m2.  
5. A composite rod is 1000mm long, its two ends are 40mm2 and 30mm2 in area and length are 300mm and 200mm respectively. The middle portion of the rod is 20mm2 in area. If the rod is subjected to an axial tensile load of 1000N, what will be its total elongation (E = 200GPa)?
a) 0.145mm
b) 0.127mm
c) 0.187mm
d) 0.196mm
d
  Length, L1 = 300mm, L2 = 500mm, L3 = 200mm
   E = 200GPa = 200x 1000 N/mm2
Total extension = P/E x (L1/A1 + L2/A2 + L3/A3). 
6. A rod of two sections of area 625mm2 and 2500mm2 of length 120cm and 60cm respectively. If the load applied is 45kN then what will be the elongation (E = 2.1x 105 N/mm2)?
a) 0.462mm
b) 0.521mm
c) 0.365mm
d) 0.514mm
a
    Area, A1 = 625mm2, A2 = 2500mm2,
  Length, L1 = 1200mm, L2 = 600mm
Elongation =  P/E x (L1/A1 + L2/A2). 
7. What will be the elongation of a bar of 1250mm2 area and 90cm length when applied a force of 130kN if E = 1.05x 105 N/mm2?
a) 0.947mm
b) 0.891mm
c) 0.845mm
d) 0.745mm
b
       P = 130x 1000N,   L = 900mm,  A = 1250 mm2, E = 1.05 x 105 N/m2.  
8. A bar shown in diagram is subjected to load 160kN. If the stress in the middle portion Is limited to 150N/mm2, what will be the diameter of the middle portion?
a) 3.456 cm
b) 3.685 cm
c) 4.524 cm
d) 4.124 cm
b
 For middle portion area = load / stress
     This gives area by which diameter can be calculated.  
9. A steel bar of 20mm x 20mm square cross-section is subjected to an axial compressive load of 100kN. If the length of the bar is 1m and E=200GPa, then what will be the elongation of the bar?
a) 1.25mm
b) 2.70mm
c) 5.40mm
d) 4.05mm
a
