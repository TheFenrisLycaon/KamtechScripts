1. If a bar of two different length are in a line and P load is acting axially on them then what will be the change in length of the bar if the radius of both different lengths is same?
a) P/E x (L1 + L2)
b) PA/E x (L1 + L2)
c) P/EA x (L1 + L2)
d) E/PA x (L1 + L2)
c
          Change in length of section 2 = PL2/EA2
   Since diameter is same for both the sections, the respective area will be the same
           Total change in length of bar = PL1/EA1 + PL2/EA2 = P/EA x (L1 + L2).
2. If a bar of two sections of different diameters of same length are in a line and P load is acting axially on them then what will be the change in length of the bar?
a) PL/E x (1/A1 + 1/A2)
b) P/E x (1/A1 + 1/A2)
c) P/EL x (1/A1 + 1/A2)
d) PE/L x (1/A1 + 1/A2)
a
          Change in length of section 2 = PL2/EA2
     Since length is same for both the sections,
Total change length of bar = PL/E x (1/A1 + 1/A2).

5. An axial pull of 35000 N on a bar consisting of two lengths as shown with their respective dimensions. What will be the total extension of the bar if the young’s modulus = 2.1 x 105?
a) 0.153mm
b) 0.183mm
c) 0.197mm
d) 0.188mm
b
     Where P = 35000 N, E = 2.1 x 105 N/mm2, L1 and L2 are the 20cm and 25cm respectively and A1 and A2 are the area of both the sections respectively.
6. An axial pull of 20 kN on a bar of two equal lengths of 20cm as shown with their respective dimensions. What will be the total extension of the bar if the young’s modulus = 2×105?
a) 0.200mm
b) 0.345mm
c) 0.509mm
d) 0.486mm
c
     Where P = 2 kN, E = 2 x 105 N/mm2, L1 and L2 are same of 20cm and A1and A2 are the area of both the sections respectively.
7. Does the value of stress in each section of a composite bar is constant or not?
a) It changes in a relationship with the other sections as well
b) It changes with the total average length
c) It is constant for every bar
d) It is different in every bar in relation with the load applied and the cross sectional area
d
8. A composite bar of two sections of equal length and equal diameter is under an axial pull of 10kN. What will be the stresses in the two sections?
a) 3.18 N/mm2
b) 2.21 N/mm2
c) 3.45 N/mm2
d) 2.14 N/mm2
a
 Where P = 1000N and A is the respective cross section area of the sections. Here the stress will be equal in both the sections as the dimensions are the same.  
9. A composite bar of two sections of unequal length and equal diameter is under an axial pull of 10kN. What will be the stresses in the two sections?
a) 2.145 N/mm2
b) 3.18 N/mm2
c) 1.245 N/mm2
d) 2.145 N/mm2
b
 Where P = 1000N and A is the respective cross section area of the sections. Here the stress will be equal in both the sections as the diameter is the same for both the sections. Even if the length is the variable it will not alter the stress value as the length does not depend on the stress.
10. A composite bar of two sections of equal length and given diameter is under an axial pull of 15kN. What will be the stresses in the two sections in N/mm2?
a) 190.9 and 84.88

d) 153045 and 44.35
a
 Where P = 15000N and A is the respective cross section area of the sections.
