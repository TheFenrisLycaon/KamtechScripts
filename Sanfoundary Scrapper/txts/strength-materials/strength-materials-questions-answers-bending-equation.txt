b
4. E/R = M/I = f/y is a bending equation.
a) True
b) False
a
E/R = M/I = f/y is a bending equation. It is also known as flexure equation (or) equation for theory of simple bending.
Where,
E stands for Young’s modulus or modulus of elasticity.
R stands for radius of curvature.
M stands for bending moment
I stand for moment of inertia
f     stands for bending stress
y    stands for neutral axis.
5. Maximum Shearing stress in a beam is at _____
a) Neutral axis
b) Extreme fibres
c) Mid span
d) Action of loading
a
6. At the neutral axis, bending stress is _____
a) Minimum
b) Maximum
c) Zero
d) Constant
c
7. Curvature of the beam is __________ to bending moment.
a) Equal
b) Directly proportion
c) Inversely proportion
d) Coincides
b
        1 / R = M / EI
Hence the curvature of the beam is directly proportional to bending moment and inversely proportional to flexural rigidity (EI).
8. What are the units of flexural rigidity?
a) Nm2
b) Nm
c) N/m
d) m/N3
a
Units for E are N/m2
Units for I are m4
Their product is Nm2.
9. What are the units for section modulus?
a) m2
b) m4
c) m3
d) m
c
Z = I/y
    = m4/ m
    = m3.
10. What are the units of axial stiffness?
a) m3
b) m2
c) N/ m
d) -m
c
11. Calculate the modulus of section of rectangle beam of size 240 mm × 400 mm.
a) 5.4 × 106  mm3
b) 6.2 × 106  mm3
c) 5.5 × 106 mm3
d) 6.4 × 106  mm3
d
Moment of inertia (I) = bd3/12; y = d/2
Section modulus (Z) = I/y = bd2/ 6
                                     = 1/6 × 240 × 400 ×400
                                     = 6.4 × 106 mm3.
12. What is the product of force and radius?
a) Twisting shear
b) Turning shear
c) Turning moment
d) Tilting moment
c
13. Determine section modulus for beam of 100mm diameter.
a) 785 × 103 mm3
b) 456  × 103 mm3
c) 87 × 103 mm3
d) 98 × 103 mm3
d
 For circular sections;  I =  π / 64 × d4
                                       y= d/2
                                        Z =  π/32 ×  d3 (d = 100 mm)
                                         Z = 98.17 × 103mm3.
