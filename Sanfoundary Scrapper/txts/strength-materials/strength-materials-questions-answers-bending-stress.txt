1. A beam is said to be of uniform strength, if ____________
a) B.M. is same throughout the beam
b) Shear stress is the same through the beam
c) Deflection is the same throughout the beam
d) Bending stress is the same at every section along its longitudinal axis
d
2. Stress in a beam due to simple bending is ____________
a) Directly proportional
b) Inversely proportional
c) Curvilinearly related
d) None of the mentioned
a
3. Which stress comes when there is an eccentric load applied?
a) Shear stress
b) Bending stress
c) Tensile stress
d) Thermal stress
b
4. What is the expression of the bending equation?
a) M/I = σ/y = E/R
b) M/R = σ/y = E/I
c) M/y = σ/R = E/I
d) M/I = σ/R = E/y
a
where
M is the bending moment
I is the moment of inertia
y is the distance from neutral axis
E is the modulus of elasticity
R is the radius. 
5. On bending of a beam, which is the layer which is neither elongated nor shortened?
a) Axis of load
b) Neutral axis
c) Center of gravity
d) None of the mentioned
b
6. The bending stress is ____________
a) Directly proportional to the distance of layer from the neutral layer
b) Inversely proportional to the distance of layer from the neutral layer
c) Directly proportional to the neutral layer
d) Does not depend on the distance of layer from the neutral layer
a
 Here stress is directly proportional to the distance of layer from the neutral layer. 
7. Consider a 250mmx15mmx10mm steel bar which is free to expand is heated from 15C to 40C. what will be developed?
a) Compressive stress
b) Tensile stress
c) Shear stress
d) No stress
d
8. The safe stress for a hollow steel column which carries an axial load of 2100 kN is 125 MN/m2. if the external diameter of the column is 30cm, what will be the internal diameter?
a) 25 cm
b) 26.19cm
c) 30.14 cm
d) 27.9 cm
b
         Area = load / stress.
   So, π/4 ( 0.302 – d2) m2 = 21 / 125
                d = 26.19cm.
