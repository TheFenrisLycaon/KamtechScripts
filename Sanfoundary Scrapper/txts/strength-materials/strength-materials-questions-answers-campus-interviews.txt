1. Calculate the eccentricity of a trapezoidal dam with a distance between the centre of gravity and point where the resultant cuts the base is 5m. The bottom width of the dam is 3m.
a) 2.5m
b) 3.5m
c) 4.5m
d) 5m
b
Z= distance between the centre of gravity and point where the resultant cuts the base is 5m.
                                                            = 5-3/2  =  1.5m.
