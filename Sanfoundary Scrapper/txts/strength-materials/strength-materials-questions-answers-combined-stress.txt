a) 100kNm
b) 127kNm
c) 130kNm
d) 145kNm
c
Factored bending moment for simply supported beam (M) = wl2/ 8.                                                                                                          = 56.25×(4.3)2/ 8     =  130kNm.
4. Determine the limiting percentage of steel for singly reinforced sections of M20 grade & Fe415.
a) 0.68
b) 0.79
c) 0.96
d) 1.76
c
Grade of concrete
Limiting percentage of tensile Steel for a Fe415
M15
0.72
M20
0.96
M25
1.19
5. Calculate the limiting depth of the neutral axis for mild steel of effective depth 400 mm.
a) 318mm
b) 212mm
c) 455mm
d) 656mm
b
Xu (max) = 0.53 × d ( for Fe250)
                 = 0.53 × 400
                 = 212mm.
