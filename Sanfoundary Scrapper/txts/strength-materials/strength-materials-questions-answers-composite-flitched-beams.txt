1. In flitched beams ______ remains same for both materials.
a) Stress
b) Strain
c) Section modulus
d) Young’s modulus
b
A timber beam strengthened by steel strips.
Where E of timber / E of steel = m
The equivalent width = b + 2mt.
2. What is the moment due to dead load in case of continuous beams at the middle of interior spans?
a) w L3 / 12
b) w L2/ 14
c) w 3/ 20
d) w L2 / 24
d
Position
Moment due to dead load
Near middle of end span
W L2/ 12
At the middle of interior span
W L2/ 24
At the support  next to and support
-W L2/  22
.
3. A continuous beam is one which is _______
a) Infinitely long
b) Supported at two points
c) Supported it more than two supports
d) Supported by a prop
c

5. The phenomenon under which the strain of material varies under constant stress is known as ________
a) Creep
b) Hysteresis
c) Viscoelasticity
d) Strain hardening
a
6. Volumetric strain = 3× _____ strain.
a) Lateral
b) Linear
c) Composite
d) Yield
b
The volumetric strain is algebraic sum of all the linear(or) axial strain when a solid to be subjected to equal normal sources of the same type of all faces we will have €x, €y and €z equal in value. In this case the volumetric strain will be 3 times the linear strain in any of the three axes.
7. The stress corresponding to breaking point is known as _____________
a) yield stress
b) ultimate stress
c) breaking stress
d) normal stress
c
8. Determine the yield stress of a steel rod 20 mm diameter, if the yield load on the steel rod is 88kN.
a) 240.55 N/mm2
b) 280.25 N/mm2
c) 325 N/mm2
d) 290.45 N/mm2
b
Yield stress = yield load/ Area
                      = 88 × 103/ 314
                      = 280.25 N/mm2.
9. What is the elongation percentage of a steel rod of 50 mm diameter if the total extension is is 54 mm and gauge length is 200 mm.
a) 27%
b) 23%
c) 43%
d) 35%
a
                                                                  = 54/200 × 100
                                                                 = 27%.
10. __________ joints are provided when there is a break in the concreting operation.
a) transverse joints
b) longitudinal joints
c) construction joints
d) warpage joints
c
