1. For keeping the stress wholly compressive the load may be applied on a circular column anywhere within a concentric circle of diameter _____________
a) D/2
b) D/3
c) D/4
d) D/8
c
2. Consider two bars A and B of same material tightly secured between two unyielding walls. Coefficient of thermal expansion of bar A is more than that of B. What are the stresses induced on increasing the temperature?
a) Tension in both the materials
b) Tension in material A and compression in material B
c) Compression in material A and tension in material B
d) Compression in both the materials
d
3. What will be the unit of compressive stress?
a) N
b) N/mm
c) N/mm2
d) Nmm
c
4. A cast iron T section beam is subjected to pure bending. For maximum compressive stress to be 3 times the maximum tensile stress, centre of gravity of the section from flange side is ____________
a) h/2
b) H/3
c) H/4
d) 2/3h
c
5. A solid circular shaft of diameter d is subjected to a torque T. the maximum normal stress induced in the shaft is ____________
a) Zero
b) 16T/πd3
c) 32T/πd3
d) None of the mentioned
b
So, normal stress =  16T/πd3. 
6. When a rectangular beam is loaded transversely, the maximum compressive stress develops on ____________
a) Bottom fibre
b) Top fibre
c) Neutral axis
d) Every cross-section
b
7. An axial residual compressive stress due to a manufacturing process is present on the outer surface of a rotating shaft subjected to bending. Under a given bending load, the fatigue of the shaft in the presence of the residual compressive stress is ____________
a) Decreased
b) Increases or decreased, depending on the external bending load
c) Neither decreased nor increased
d) Increases
d
8. A steel bar of 40mm x 40mm square cross-section is subjected to an axial compressive load of 200kN. If the length of the bar is 2m and E=200GPa, the elongation of the bar well be ____________
a) 1.25mm
b) 2.70mm
c) 4.05mm
d) 5.40mm
a
          The minus sign here shows that the stress here is compressive.
