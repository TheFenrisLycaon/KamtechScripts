9. ________ has to be provided against diagonal tensile stresses.
a) Longitudinal reinforcement
b) Shear reinforcement
c) Torsional reinforcement
d) Transverse reinforcement
b
10. Vertical stirrups are a form of _______ reinforcement.
a) Tension
b) Shear
c) Compression
d) Torsion
b
11. The shear to be resisted by shear reinforcement is given by ___________
a) Vus = Vuc + Vu
b) Vus = Vu + Vuc
c) Vu = Vus – Vuc
d) Vus = Vu – Vuc
d
Vus = Vu – Vuc
Where: Vuc = shear resistance of concrete
                 Vu = ultimate shear force
▪ The number of stirrups cut by 45° crack line is n = d/Sv.
12. The shear resistance of bent up bars shall not exceed __________ the total shear to be resisted.
a) 30 %
b) 50%
c) 40%
d) 25%
b
13. What is the horsepower of the engine if the power is 219324 W.
a) 312
b) 268
c) 294
d) 304
c
Horse power = P/746
                        =  219324/746
                        = 294 W.
14. A lift carry 10 persons each weighing 60 kg to the top storey of the building 100 m height. Calculate the potential energy acquired by the person.
a) 5.88 × 105 J
b) 4.32 × 105 J
c) 2.34 × 105J
d) 1.16 × 105J
a
Mass of each person = 60 kg
Mass of 10 persons = 600
Potential energy = mgh
                               = 600 × 9.8 × 105
                                = 5.88 × 10 /5 J.
15. Calculate the maximum shear stress of a circular beam of 100 mm diameter, if the average shear stress is 0.63 N/mm2.
a) 0.85 N/mm2
b) 1.2 N/mm2
c) 1.5 N/mm2
d) 2.1 N/mm2
a
 The maximum shear stress = 4/3 × average shear stress
                                                  = 4/3 × 0.6366
                                                  = 0.85 N/mm2.
