6. A material of youngs modulus and Poissons ratio of unity is subjected to two principal stresses σ1 and σ2 at a point in two dimensional stress system. The strain energy per unit volume of the material is __________
a) (σ12 + σ22 – 2σ1σ2 ) / 2E
b) (σ12 + σ22 + 2σ1σ2 )  / 2E
c) (σ12 – σ22 – 2σ1σ2 )  / 2E

9. A bar of cross-section A and length L is subjected to an axial load W. the strain energy stored in the bar would be __________
a) WL / AE
b) W2L / 4AE
c) W2L / 2AE
d) WL / 4AE
c
           Strain energy = W/2 x WL / AE  =  W2L / 2AE.
10. A tensile load of 60kN is gradually applied to a circular bar of 4cm diameter and 5m long. What is the stretch in the rod if E = 2×105 N/mm2?
a) 1.1mm
b) 1.24mm
c) 2mm
d) 1.19mm
d
         So stretch = stress x length / E = 1.19mm.
11. A tensile load of 50kN is gradually applied to a circular bar of 5cm diameter and 5m long. What is the strain energy absorbed by the rod (E = 200GPa)?
a) 14 N-m
b) 15.9 N-mm
c) 15.9 N-m
d) 14 N-mm
c
       Strain energy = σ2V/2E = 25.46×25.46×9817477 / (2×200000) = 15909.5 N-mm = 15.9 N-m.
12. A tensile load of 60kN is gradually applied to a circular bar of 4cm diameter and 5m long. What is the strain energy in the rod if the load is applied suddenly (E = 2×105 N/mm2)?
a) d143.23 N-m
b) 140.51 N-m
c) 135.145 N-m
d) 197.214 N-m
a
                  Strain energy = σ2V/2E = 143288N-mm = 143.238 N-m.
