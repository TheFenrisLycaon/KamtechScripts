1. The ratio of maximum deflection of a beam to its ___________ is called stiffness of the beam.
a) Load
b) Slope
c) Span
d) Reaction at the support
c
2. Stiffness of the beam is inversely proportional to the _____ of the beam.
a) Slope
b) Support reaction
c) Deflection
d) Load
c
3. The maximum ____ should not exceed the permissible limit to the span of the beam.
a) Slope
b) Deflection
c) Load
dl Bending moment
b
4. In cantilever beam the deflection occurs at ______
a) Free end
b) Point of loading
c) Through out
d) Fixed end
a
5. The maximum deflection in cantilever beam of span “l”m and loading at free end is “W” kN.
a) Wl3/2EI
b) Wl3/3EI
c) Wl3/4EI
d) Wl2/2EI
b
As deflection is equal to the slope × “x”. The slope = Wl2/2EI radians
Maximum deflection (y) = Ax/EI = Wl3/3EI.
6. In an ideal fluid, the ____________ stresses are pretend to be absent.
a) Bending
b) Shearing
c) Tensile
d) Compressive
b
7. Air and water are the examples of ___________
a) Non Newtonian fluids
b) Vortex fluids
c) Real fluids
d) Ideal fluids
d
8. _______ fluids are practical fluids
a) Ideal
b) Real
c) Vortex
d) Newtonian
b
9. Specific weight of water at 4°C is ____________ N/m3.
a) 9810
b) 9760
c) 9950
d) 9865
a
10. The inverse of specific weight of a fluid is __________
a) Specific gravity
b) Specific Volume
c) Compressibility
d) Viscosity
b
v= 1/specific weight.
11. Calculate the specific gravity of mercury.
a) 12.5
b) 14.7
c) 13.6
d) 11.8
c
S = 133416/9810
S= 13.6.
12. Specific gravity of water is __________
a) 0.8
b) 1
c) 1.2
d) 1.5
b
13. Compute the maximum deflection at free end of a cantilever beam subjected to udl for entire span of l metres.
a) wl4/8EI
b) wl4/4EI
c) wl3/8EI
d) wl2/6EI
a
Maximum deflection at free end is Ax/EI; [x= ¾ l]
 y= wl3/6EI × ¾ l = wl4/8EI.
14. Calculate the maximum deflection of a cantilever beam with udl on entire span of 3m the intensity of you udl be 25 kN/m. Take EI as 4000 kN/m2.
a) 0.052m
b) 0.063m
c) 0.076m
d) 0.09m
b
y = wl4/8EI = 25 × 34/ 8 × 4000 = 0.063m.
15. Which of the following is not an example of Malleability?
a) Wrought Iron
b) Ornamental silver
c) Torsteel
d) Ornamental gold
c
