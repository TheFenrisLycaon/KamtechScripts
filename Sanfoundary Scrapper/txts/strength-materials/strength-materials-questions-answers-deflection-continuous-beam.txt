1. The maximum negative bending moment in fixed beam carrying udl occurs at ________
a) Mid span
b) 1/3 of the span
c) Supports
d) Half of the span
c
2. A fixed beam of the uniform section is carrying a point load at the centre, if the moment of inertia of the middle half portion is reduced to half its previous value, then the fixed end moments will ______
a) Increase
b) Remains constant
c) Decrease
d) Change their direction
a
3. In propped cantilevers, the prop reaction is 3/8 wl.
a) True
b) False
a
R= 3wl/8.
4. A propped cantilever beam carrying total load “W” distributed evenly over its entire length calculate the vertical force required in the prop.
a) 3/4 W
b) W
c) 5/8 W
d) 3/8 W
d
Rl3/3EI = Wl3/ 8EI.
R = 3W/8.
The vertical force required at the prop is 3W/8.
5. _____ is a small opening made in the bottom or sides of a tank.
a) Mouthpiece
b) Orifice
c) Sill
d) Sluice
b
6. A mouthpiece is a short length of a pipe which is not more than __________ times its diameter.
a) 3-4
b) 5-6
c) 1 -2
d) 2-3
d
7. The section which has a minimum cross sectional are in a flow is known as _______
a) Vena contracta
b) Thyrocade
c) Submergent
d) Upstream edge
a
8. Bell mouthed orifices can be categorised in according to ___________
a) Size
b) Shape
c) Shape of upstream
d) Nature of discharge
c
9. Which of the following is not a hydraulic coefficient?
a) Coefficient of contraction
b) Coefficient of discharge
c) Coefficient of viscosity
d) Coefficient of velocity
c
10. Theorotical velocity = _______
a) (2gh)1/3
b) (2gh)1/2
c) (2gh)1/4
d) 2gh
b
Where h = liquid head above the centre of orifice.
11. The value of Cv varies _______ to ________
a) 0.95 – 0.99
b) 0.93 – 0.95
c) 0.97 – 1
d) 0.94 – 0.96
a
12. The Cv taken for sharp edged orifice generally is _________
a) 0.97
b) 0.98
c) 0.95
d) 0.99
b
 Value For Sharp edged orifice
Hydraulic coefficient
0.98
Cv
0.64
Ca
0.62
Cd
13. Coeffecient of discharge varies from ___________ to __________
a) 0.64 to 0.68
b) 0.61 to 0.65
c) 0.63 to 0.67
d) 0.67 to 0.7
b
14. The relation between hydraulic coefficients is Cd = Cc × Cv.
a) False
b) True
b
 But Qa = ac V =(Cc a) × Cv × (2gh)1/2.
Qth = a Vth
Cd = Qa Qth = Cc a × Cv (2gh)1/2/a × (2gh)1/2.
Cd = Cc × Cv.
15. Calculate the actual velocity of jet if the coefficient of velocity is 0.97. The head of water on the orifice of diameter 2 cm is 6 m.
a) 11 m/s
b) 12 m/s
c) 10.5 m/s
d) 13 m/s
c
Va = 0.97 (2× 9.81 ×6 )1/2.
Va = 10.5 m/s.
