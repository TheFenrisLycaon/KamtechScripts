1. In fixed beams, the maximum deflection at __________ is reduced.
a) Centre
b) Supports
c) At point of loading
d) Through out
a
2. Fixing couples means _____
a) End moments
b) Support couples
c) Support moments
d) End supports
c
3. Calculate the maximum bending moment in fixed beam for the following figure.
a) 17 kN-m
b) 12.5 kN-m
c) 15.625 kN-m
d) 18 kN-m
c
Maximum bending moment (M) = 25 × 5 / 8
                                                            = 15.625 kNm.
4. _________ is provided to prevent the debris from entering into the penstock.
a) Tash rack
b) Surge tank
c) Anchor blocks
d) Power house
a
5. __________ regulates the speed of turbine.
a) Tail race
b) Anchor blocks
c) Power house
d) Surge tank
d
6. The sheet of water flowing through a notch is called ________
a) Sill
b) Crest
c) Scour
d) Nappe
d
7. Which of the following is empirical formula coined by Francis?
a) 2.36 LH3/2
b) 1.84 LH3/2
c) 3.34 LH3/2
d) 1.96 LH3/2
b
Q = 1.84 LH3/2
Where Q = discharge in m3/ s.
8. Calculate discharge of a weir 2 metre long with a water flow over a head of 250 mm use Francis formula.
a) 0.34 m3/s
b) 0.46 m3/s
c) 0.25 m3/s
d) 0.65 m3/s
b
Length of weir = L = 2m.
Head over the weir = 0.25 m
Using Francis formula; Q =1.84  LH3/2 = 1.84 × 2×(0.25)3/2.
                                         Q = 0.46 m3/s.
9. 1 litre = ____________ m3.
a) 104
b) 103
c) 10-3
d) 10-4
c
 For example, Q = 40 lit/min = 40/60 lit/sec = 0.67 × 10-3m3/sec.
10. In cipoletti weir, the side slopes are _______________
a) 1 in 3
b) 1 in 2
c) 1 in 5
d) 1 in 4
d
11. The flow of thick oil through a small tube is an example for _________
a) Laminar flow
b) Turbulent flow
c) Rotational flow
d) Steady flow
a
12. Flow in rivers is an example of __________ flow.
a) Rotational
b) Laminar
c) Compressible
d) Turbulent
d
13. What is the point of contraflexure in a fixed beam of span 5m?
a) 3m
b) 2.75 m
c) 3.75 m
d) 4 m
c
From support A = 3l/4 = 3×5/4 = 3.75 m.
From support B = 3l/4 = 3×5/4 = 3.75 m.
14. Water table should be at least __________ m below subgrade.
a) 1.5m
b) 3 m
c) 1.2 m
d) 2.5 m
c
15. Torsteel is an example of _______
a) Elasticity
b) Plasticity
c) Malleability
d) Ductility
d
