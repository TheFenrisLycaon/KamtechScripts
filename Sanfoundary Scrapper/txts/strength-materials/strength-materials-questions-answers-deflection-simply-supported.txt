b) Stiffness
c) Slope
d) Maximum bending
b
2. The maximum induced ___________ stresses should be within the safe permissible stresses to ensure strength of the beam.
a) Tensile
b) Compressive
c) Bending
d) Lateral
c
3. Elastic line is also called as ___________

b) Plastic curve
c) Linear curve
d) Hooke’s curve
a
4. In simply supported beams, the slope is _____________ at supports.
a) Minimum
b) Zero
c) Maximum
d) Uniform
c
5. In simply supported beam deflection is maximum at ____________
a) Midspan
b) Supports
c) Point of loading
d) Through out
a
6. Calculate the maximum deflection of a simply supported beam if the maximum slope at A is 0.0075 radians and the distance of centre of gravity of bending moment diagram to support A is 1.33 metres.
a) 9.975 mm
b) 9.5 mm
c) 9.25 mm
d) 9.785 mm
a
Maximum deflection = Ax/EI = 0.0075 × 1.33
                                     y = 9.975 mm.
7. ____________ is the best example for accelerator (admixture).

b) Calcium chloride
c) Sulphonated naphthalene
d) Polyglycolesters
b
8. _____________ is used to reduce the time for hardening of concrete.
a) Accelerators
b) Super plasticizer
c) Retarder
d) Air entraining admixture
c
i. In hot weather condition, a tendency towards false set is corrected
ii.  When concrete is to be placed in difficult positions.
9. Full form of LEED ________
a) Leadership in Energy and Efficiency Development
b) Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design
c) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
d) Leadership in Efflorescence and  Energy Demand
c
10. _____ has a lower heat of hydration.
a) Quarry dust
b) Fly ash
c) Ordinary Portland cement
d) Bulk sand
b
11. The factors that influence rate of hydration is _________
a) The fineness of cement
b) Temperature of cement
c) Quality of water
d) Temperature of water
a
12. The steel suits best to reinforcement with concrete.
a) False
b) True
b
i. Steel is about 30 times stronger in compression and 300 times stronger intention compared to concrete.
ii. It develops good bond with concrete
iii. It is highly fire resistant.
13. The average crushing strength of precast concrete blocks as per CAI is __________
a) 4.5 N/mm2
b) 5 N/mm2
c) 3.5 N/mm2
d) 4 N/mm2
c
The average crushing strength of blocks Shall be  5N/mm2.
14. A simply supported beam of span as shown in the figure is subjected to a concentrated load w at its metre span and also to a uniformly distributed load equality w what is the total diffraction it its midpoint.
a) 18 Wl3 /384 EI
b) 13 Wl3/ 384 EI
c) 5 Wl3/ 384 EI
d) 18 Wl3/ 384 EI
b
y = 5Wl3/ 384 EI + Wl3/ 48 EI
y = 13Wl3/ 384 EI.
15. Meander ratio is the ratio of meander belt to __________
a) Meander depth
b) Meander width
c) Meander length
d) Meander cross-section
c
