1. Units of deflection are _________
a) kNm
b) kN/m
c) kN
d) m
d
2. Which of the following method is used to determine the slope and deflection at a point?
a) Arithmetic increase method
b) Mathematical curve setting
c) Macaulay’s method
d) Lacey’s  method
c
Advantages:
i. Gives one continuous expression for bending moment
ii. Constants of integration can be found by using end conditions
iii. By using this method, slope and deflection at any section can be determined throughout the length of the beam.
3. Deflection is denoted by _______
a) i
b) y
c) h
d) e
b
4. In cantilever beams, the deflection is zero at ___________
a) Free and
b) Fixed end
c) At supports
d) Through out
b
5. Mohr’s theorem -¡¡ states?
a) Ax/EI
b) A/Ex
c) A/EI
d) Ae=Ix
a
6. Calculate the deflection if the slope is 0.0225 radians. Take the distance of centre of gravity of bending moment to free end as 2 metres.
a) 45mm
b) 35mm
c) 28mm
d) 49mm
a
But, we know that A/EI is already slope equation.
So, slope × (the distance of centre of gravity of bending moment to free end = 2m).
0.0225 × 2
0.045m ~ 45 mm.
7. In simply supported beams, deflection is zero at _________
a) Mid span
b) Supports
c) Through out
d) Point of action of load
b
8. Which of the following is not a cross drainage work?
a) Aqueduct
b) Level crossing
c) Head regulator
d) Super passage
c
9. Tail escape is also called as ___________
a) Outlet
b) Cross regulator
c) Weir type escape
d) Surplus escape
c
10. The land where all the water comes from ___________
a) Ridge dam
b) Watershed
c) Meander
d) Groynes
b
11. ____________ reduces storm water discharge.
a) Rain water harvesting
b) Water harvesting
c) Watershed
d) Watershed management
b
12. Which of the following is not a soil moisture conservation method?
a) Spreading manure
b) Crop rotation
c) Recharge to ground water
d) By mulches
c
13. Nutrients like ca, mg, si, al, S, K are lost due to ____________
a) Soil erosion
b) Percolation
c) Water logging
d) Watershed
b
14. Warabandi has been practiced in India for more than ____________ years.
a) 130 years
b) 125 years
c) 140 years
d) 145 years
b
15. Gold, Copper and lead are the examples of ______
a) Ductility
b) Creep
c) Plasticity
d) Malleability
c
