1. How many elastic constants of a linear, elastic, isotropic material will be?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 1
d) 4
a
Orthotropic materials refer to layered structure such as wood or plywood. The number of independent elastic constants for such materials is 9.
Non isotropic or anisotropic materials have different properties in different directions. They show non- homogeneous behaviour. The number of elastic constants is 21. 
2. How many elastic constants of a non homogeneous, non isotropic material will be?
a) 9
b) 15
c) 20
d) 21
d
3. How can be the Poissons ratio be expressed in terms of bulk modulus(K) and modulus of rigidity(G)?
a) (3K – 4G) / (6K + 4G)
b) (3K + 4G) /( 6K – 4G)
c) (3K – 2G) / (6K + 2G)
d) (3K + 2G) / (6K – 2G)
c
μ = (3K – 2G) / (6K + 2G).
4. Calculate the modulus of resilience for a 2m long bar which extends 2mm under limiting axial stress of 200 N/mm2?
a) 0.01
b) 0.20
c) 0.10
d) 0.02
c
                               = 200×2/2×2000
                              = 0.10. 
5. In an experiment, the bulk modulus of elasticity of a material is twice its modulus of rigidity. The Poissons ratio of the material is ___________
a) 1/7
b) 2/7
c) 3/7
d) 4/7
b
           Given  K = 2G
      Then,  μ = (6G – 2G) / (12G + 2G)  =  4/14  = 2/7.
6. What will be the value of the Poisson’s ratio if the Youngs modulus E is equal to the bulk modulus K?
a) 1/2
b) 1/4
c) 1/3
d) 3/4
c
            Since K = E
   So   (1-2μ)  =  1/3
   Therefore, μ = 1/3.
7. What is the expression for modulus of rigidity in terms of modulus of elasticity and the Poissons ratio?
a) G = 3E / 2(1 + μ)
b) G = 5E / (1 + μ)
c) G = E / 2(1 + μ)
d) G = E/ (1 + 2μ)
c
      G = E / 2(1 + μ).
8. What is the relationship between Youngs modulus E, modulus of rigidity C, and bulk modulus K?
a) E = 9KC / (3K + C)
b) E = 9KC / (9K + C)
c) E = 3KC / (3K + C)
d) E = 3KC / (9K + C)
a
       E = 9KC / (3K + C).
9. What is the limiting values of Poisson’s ratio?
a) -1 and 0.5
b) -1 and -0.5
c) -1 and -0.5
d) 0 and 0.5
d
10. What is the relationship between modulus of elasticity and modulus of rigidity?
a) C = E / 2(1 + μ)
b) C = E / (1 + μ)
c) C = 2E / (1 + μ)
d) C = 2E / 2(1 + μ)
c
          C = E / 2(1 + μ).
