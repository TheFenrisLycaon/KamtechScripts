c) Moment of resistance
d) Maximum bending moment
c
2. ______ strength is caused by a moment of resistance offered by a section.

b
3. A Steel rod 200 mm diameter is to be bent into a circular arc section. Find radius of curvature. Take f = 120N/mm2 & E = 2×105 N/mm2.
a) 134m
b) 166m
c) 162m
d) 174m
b
f= 120N/mm2.
E= 2×105N/mm2.
By flexural equation we have f/y = E/R
R = 2×105/ 120 ×100
   = 166.6m.

c
Total pressure = p × A.
5. The ____ of strongest beam that can be cut out of a circular section of diameter D.
a) Load
b) Size
c) material
d) cross section
b
Depth;       d = Square root of 2/3
                    b = D / square root of 3.
Among the given sections for the same depth I section gives maximum strength.
6. The moment resisting capacity of the cross section of a beam is termed as ______ of the beam.
a) Stiffness
b) Strength
c) Modulus
d) Inertia
b
7. Find the moment of resistance of rectangular beam off grid to 40 mm depth 400 mm if the bending stress is 15 N/mm2.
a) 78 kNm
b) 84 kNm
c) 96 kNm
d) 132 kNm
c
                                                                            = bd2 / 6 × 15
                                                                             = 96 ×106 Nmm.
8. A rectangular beam 100 mm wide is subjected to a maximum shear force and 50 kN. Find the depth of the beam.
a) 350 mm
b) 185 mm
c) 200 mm
d) 250 mm
d
Maximum shear stress = 3/2 (Average Shear stress)
 d= 3×5000/ 3×2×100.
9. What is the approximate value of coefficient of linear expansion for steel?
a) 13 × 10-66 /°C
b) 11.5 × 10-6 /°C
c) 12 × 10-6 /°C
d) 16 × 10-6  /°C
b
10. A hollow shaft has outside diameter 120 mm and thickness 20 mm. Find the polar moment of inertia (J).
a) 16.36 × 106 mm4
b) 14.65 × 106 mm4
c) 10.32 × 106 mm4
d) 23.18 × 106 mm4
a
                        t= 20mm & d = D – 2t = 80mm.
Polar moment of inertia (J) is     π/32 ×[ D4– d4].
                                                          π/32 × [ 1204– 804 ].
                                                          16.36 × 106 mm4.
