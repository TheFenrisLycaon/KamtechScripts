1. Calculate the nominal shear stress, if a singly reinforced rectangular beam 230×450 mm effective depth is subjected to a factored load of 60 kN.
a) 0.6 N/mm2
b) 0.55 N/mm2
c) 0.4 N/mm2
d) 0.25 N/mm2
a
Shear force = Vu = 60 kN
Nominal shear stress = Vu/bd = 60 × 103/ 230 ×450
                                                       = 0.6 N/mm2.
2. The minimum shear reinforcement is given by Asv/bSv = _______
a) 0.4 /0.87 fy
b) 0.5 /0.85 fy
c) 0.6 /0.9 fy
d) 0.35/ 0.6 fsc
a
Asv/bSv = 0.4/0.87 fy.
3. Bent up bars do not resist diagonal tension.
a) True
b) False
b
4. The ultimate shear force at a section of an RCC beam is 300 kN. The shear resisted by concrete is 77.5 kN. What is the shear for which shear reinforcement is required?
a) 213.5 kN
b) 220 kN
c) 222.5 kN
d) 122.5 kN
c
Vus = Vu – Vuc;      Where Vu = ultimate shear force and Vuc = shear resistance of concrete
        = 300 – 77.5
        = 222.5 kN.
5. Bond stress is a stress acting ___________ to the bar on the interface between reinforcement and concrete.
a) Perpendicular
b) Parallel
c) Normal
d) Transverse
b
6. ________ is developed due to adhesion between concrete and steel.
a) Shear
b) Flexure
c) Bond
d) Creep
c
7. Bond is developed due to _________
a) Viscosity
b) Gravity
c) Friction
d) Acoustics
c
8. ___________ depends on grade of concrete and diameter of bar etc.
a) Shear stress
b) Bond stress
c) Bending
d) Rupture
b
9. Which of the following bond is also known as a local bond?
a) Anchorage bond
b) Fletched bond
c) Flexural bond
d) Composite bond
c
10. _____________ bond arises when bar carrying certain force is terminated.
a) Anchorage
b) Flexural
c) Indemnity
d) Equivalent
a
11. The development length can be determined easily by _______ test.
a) Push out test
b) Pull out test
c) Grading test
d) Slump cone test
b
12. To improve the anchorage of bars ______ are provided in plain bars.
a) Standard hooks
b) Stirrups
c) Lateral ties
d) Standard bends
a
13. In case of HYSD bars ___________ are provided to increase anchorage length.
a) Lateral ties
b) Helical reinforcement
c)  Standard hooks
d) Standard bends
d
14. Polar moment of inertia is denoted by ___________
a) G
b) J
c) K
d) M
b
J = 2 I.
15. Calculate the moment of inertia of a hollow circular section whose external diameter is 60 mm and thickness is 5 mm about centroidal axis.
a) 315 m2
b) 320 m4
c) 330 m4
d) 345 m4
c
Internal diameter (d) = 50 mm
Ixx = Iyy = π/64 × (604 -504).
                = 330 m4.
