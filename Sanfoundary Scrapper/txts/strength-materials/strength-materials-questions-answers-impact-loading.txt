b) P/A (2 + 2AEh/PL)
c) P/A (1 + (1 + AEh/PL)1/2)

a
3. What will be the stress induced in the rod if the height through which load is dropped is zero?
a) P/A
b) 2P/A
c) P/E
d) 2P/E
b
         Putting h=0, we get stress = 2P/A. 
4. A weight of 10kN falls by 30mm on a collar rigidly attached to a vertical bar 4m long and 1000mm2 in section. What will be the instantaneous stress (E=210GPa)?
a) 149.4 N/mm2
b) 179.24 N/mm2
c) 187.7 N/mm2
d) 156.1 N/mm2
c
           Putting P = 10,000, h = 30, L = 4000, A = 1000, E = 210,000  we will get stress = 187.7 N/mm2.
5. A load of 100N falls through a height of 2cm onto a collar rigidly attached to the lower end of a vertical bar 1.5m long and of 105cm2 cross- sectional area. The upper end of the vertical bar is fixed. What is the maximum instantaneous stress induced in the vertical bar if E = 200GPa?
a) 50.87 N/mm2
b) 60.23 N/mm2
c) 45.24 N/mm2
d) 63.14 N/mm2
b
           Putting P = 100, h = 20, L = 1500, A = 150, E = 200,000  we will get stress = 60.23 N/mm2.
6. A weight of 10kN falls by 30mm on a collar rigidly attached to a vertical bar 4m long and 1000mm2 in section. What will be the strain (E=210GPa)?
a) 0.00089
b) 0.0005
c) 0.00064
d) 0.00098
a
           Putting P = 10,000, h = 30, L = 4000, A = 1000, E = 210,000  we will get stress = 187.7 N/mm2
As strain = stress / E, thus, strain = 187.7 / 210,000  = 0.00089.
7. A load of 100N falls through a height of 2cm onto a collar rigidly attached to the lower end of a vertical bar 1.5m long and of 105cm2 cross- sectional area. The upper end of the vertical bar is fixed. What is the maximum instantaneous elongation in the vertical bar if E = 200GPa?
a) 0.245mm
b) 0.324mm
c) 0.452mm
d) 0.623mm
c
           Putting P = 100, h = 20, L = 1500, A = 150, E = 200,000  we will get stress = 60.23 N/mm2
        Elongation = stress x length / E = 60.23 x 1500 / 200,000 = 0.452mm.
8. A load of 100N falls through a height of 2cm onto a collar rigidly attached to the lower end of a vertical bar 1.5m long and of 105cm2 cross- sectional area. The upper end of the vertical bar is fixed. What is the strain energy stored in the vertical bar if E = 200GPa?
a) 2.045 N-m
b) 3.14 N-m
c) 9.4 N-mm
d) 2.14 N-m
a
           Putting P = 100, h = 20, L = 1500, A = 150, E = 200,000  we will get stress = 60.23 N/mm2.
         Strain energy stored = stress2 x volume / 2E = 60.232 x 2525000 / (2×200,000) = 2.045 N-m.
9. The maximum instantaneous extension, produced by an unknown falling weight in a vertical bar of length 3m. what will be the instantaneous stress induced in the vertical bar and the value of unknown weight if E = 200GPa?
a) 100 N/mm2
b) 110 N/mm2
c) 120 N/mm2
d) 140 N/mm2
d
10. The maximum instantaneous extension, produced by an unknown falling weight through a height of 4cm in a vertical bar of length 3m and of cross section area 5cm2. what will be the instantaneous stress induced in the vertical bar and the value of unknown weight if E = 200GPa?
a) 1700 N
b) 1459.4 N
c) 1745.8 N
d) 1947.5 N
c
      As,  P( h + δL) =  σ2/2E x V
      So P = 1745.8 N.
11. An unknown weight falls through a height of 10mm on a collar rigidly attached to a lower end of a vertical bar 500cm long. If E =200GPa what will be the value of stress?
a) 50 N/mm2
b) 60 N/mm2
c) 70 N/mm2
d) 80 N/mm2
