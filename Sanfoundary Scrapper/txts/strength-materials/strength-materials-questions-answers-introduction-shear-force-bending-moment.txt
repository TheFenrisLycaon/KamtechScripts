1. Shear force is unbalanced _____ to the left or right of the section.
a) Horizontal force
b) Vertical force
c) Inclined force
d) Conditional force
b
2. SI units of shear force is _______________
a) kN/m
b) kN-m
c) kN
d) m/N
c
3. Determine the moment at fixed end.
a) 40 kNm
b) 50 kNm
c) 60 kNm
d) 80 kNm
d
Reaction at A = 10×4 = 40 kN
 Moment at A = (10×4)×4/2
                         = 80 kNm.
