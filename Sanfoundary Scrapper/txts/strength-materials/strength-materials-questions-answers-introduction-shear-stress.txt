1. At ________ the shearing stress in a beam are maximum.
a) Extreme fibres
b) Modulus of section
c) Neutral axis
d) Along the cross-sectional area
c
2. Determine the shear stress at the level of neutral axis, if a beam has a triangle cross section having base “b” and altitude “h”. Let the shear force be subjected is F.
a) 3F/8bh
b) 4F/3bh
c) 8F/3bh
d) 3F/6bh
c
Shear stress at NA = 4/3 [Average shear stress].
                                  = 4/3 [F/0.5 bh] = 8F / 3bh.
3. The maximum shear stress is ______ times the average shear stress [For rectangular beams].
a) 2.5
b) 3
c) 1.2
d) 1.5
d
Max shear stress = 3F/2bd = 3/2 [F/bd].
                                                 = 1.5 Average shear stress.
4. Shear stress in a beam is zero at ______
a) Neutral axis
b) Extreme fibres
c) Cross section
d) Junctions
b
5. Shear stress distribution over rectangular section will be _________
a) parabolic
b) elliptical
c) triangular
d) trapezoidal
a
Maximum shear stress is 1.5 times that of average shear stress.
The shear stress distribution is parabolic.
6. A round Steel rod of 100 mm diameter is bent into an arc of radius 100m. What is the maximum stress in the rod? Take E = 2×105 N/mm2.
a) 150 N/mm2
b) 200 N/mm2
c) 100 N/mm2
d) 300 N/mm2
c
y = 50 mm
R = 10 × 103mm
By equation of flexure; E/R = f/y
                                          f=E/R ×y
                                            = 2×105/ 100 × 103× 50
                                            = 100 N/mm2.
7. For circular section, the maximum shear stress is equal to ____________ times of average shear stress.
a) 2/3
b) 3/2
c) 4/3
d) 3/4
c
Max. Shear stress = 4/3 [ F/A ].
                                 F/A is average shear stress.
The maximum shear stress distribution is 33% more than average shear stress.
8. A steel beam is 200 mm wide and 300 mm deep. The beam is simply supported and carries a concentrated load w. If the maximum stress are 2 N/mm2. What will be the corresponding load?
a) 50 kN
b) 80 kN
c) 40 kN
d) 85 kN
b
Max. Shear stress = 3/2 [F/A ]
                              2 = 3/2  [w/200 × 300].
                               w = 80 kN.
9. Maximum shear stress in thin cylindrical shell be ___________
a) pr/2t
b) pr/3t
c) pr/4t
d) pr/ 5t
c
                      Longitudinal stress P(l) = pr/2t
Thus, hoop stress is twice the longitudinal stress
Max. Shear stress = P(h) – P(l) / 2
                                =  pr/4t.
10. Circumferential stress is same as of _________
a) Hoop stress
b) Longitudinal stress
c) Transverse stress
d) Phreatic stress
a
P(h) = pr/t.
