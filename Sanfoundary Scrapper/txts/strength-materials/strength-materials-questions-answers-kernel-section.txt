c) By unit hydrograph method
d) Comparison with graph method
c
i. Flood discharge formula

8. In simply supported slabs, alternate bars are curtailed at ________
a) 1/7 of span
b) 1/5 of span
c) 1/3 of span
d) 1/6 of span
d
9. The length of the staircase between two consecutive landings is called _______
a) Tread
b) Flight
c) Rise
d) Effective width
b
10. ________ is used in the entrance of cinema theatres and shopping malls.
a) Open well stair case

c
11. In the design of lintel, determine the base angle of a triangle for poor masonry.
a) 40°
b) 45°
c) 60°
d) 90°
c
12. Calculate the height of the equilateral triangle in the design of lintel, if the masonry used is poor graded. Take effective span as 1.29 m.
a) 1.334m
b) 1.433m
c) 1.117m
d) 1.125m
c
Then height of equilateral triangle (h) = l × sin 60 °
                                                                    = 1.29 × sin 60 °
                                                                    = 1.117m.
13. For a simply supported beam, the basic l/d ratio should be ____________
a) 20
b) 22
c) 16
d) 30
a
1. For Simply supported beam – 20
2. for cantilever beam – 7
3. for continuous beam – 26.
14. A beam of clear span 6 metres is supported on bearings of 150 mm if the effective depth of a beam is 400 mm. calculate the effective span.
a) 6.4m
b) 6.15m
c) 6.0m
d) 6.3m
b
1. Clear span + d = 6 + 0.4 = 6.4m
2. Clear span + bearings/2 + bearings/2 = 6+0.15/2+0.15/2 = 6.15m
The least of the above values is 6.15 metres. Hence effective span is 6.15 m.
15. The final deflection of horizontal members will be the level of casting should not exceed _____________
a) Span/500
b) Span/250
c) Span/300
d) Span/350
b
