1. A cantilever beam subjected to point load at its free end, the maximum bending moment develops at the ________ of the beam.
a) Free end
b) Fixed end
c) Centre
d) Point of inflection
b
2. Bending moment in a beam is maximum when the _________
a) Shear force is minimum
b) Shear force is maximum
c) Shear force is zero
d) Shear force is constant
c
3. Positive bending moment is known as _______
a) Hogging
b) Sagging
c) Ragging
d) Inflection
a
4. A simply supported beam of span “x” meters carries a udl of “w” per unit length over the entire span, the maximum bending moment occurs at _____
a) At point of contra flexure
b) Centre
c) End supports
d) Anywhere on the beam
b
At the centre, maximum bending moment is wl2/8.
5. The maximum BM is ______
a) 40 kNm
b) 50 kNm
c) 90 kNm
d) 75 kNm
c
                                        = 30 × 3
                                        = 90 kNm.

a) 3
b) 2
c) 4
d) Infinite
b
8. Maximum bending moment in a cantilever beam subjected to udl (w)over the entire span (l).
a) wl
b) wl3
