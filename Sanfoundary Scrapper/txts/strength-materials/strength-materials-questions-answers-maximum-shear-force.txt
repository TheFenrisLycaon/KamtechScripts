1. Which of these is the correct way of sign convention for shear force?
a) R U P
b) L U P
c) R U N
d) L D P
c
2. At hinge, the moments will be _________
a) Maximum
b) Minimum
c) Uniform
d) Zero
d
3. What is variation in SFD, if the type of loading in the simply supported beam is U.D.L is ____
a) Rectangle
b) Linear
c) Trapezoidal
d) Parabolic
b
4. The rate of change of shear force is equal to _____
a) Direction of load
b) Change in BMD
c) Intensity of loading
d) Maximum bending
c
 Let the shear force at left  of the section is = F
 Let the increase in shear force in length of the dx = dF
Let the Indian city of load on this part of the beam = w
Total downward load in this elemental length = wdx
    €V = 0
    dF  = -wdx
    dF/dx = -w
This rate of change of shear force at any section is equal to the intensity of loading at that section.
5. The shear force in a beam subjected to pure positive bending is _____
a) Positive
b) Negative
c) Zero
d) Cannot determine
c

8. A simply supported beam of span 1 m carries a point load “w” in centre determine the shear force in the half left of the beam.
a) W/3
b) W/4
c) W/2

c
9. At the Point of contraflexure, what is the value of bending moment?
a) one
b) zero
c) three
