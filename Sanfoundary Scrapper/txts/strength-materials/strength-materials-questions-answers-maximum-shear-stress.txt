1. Shear stress at top most fibre of rectangular section is _____________
a) Maximum
b) Minimum
c) Zero
d) Uniform through out
c
The shear stress at a distance “y “ from NA = 6F/bd3 × u   (u = d2/4-y)
The maximum shear stress occurs at a neutral axis, in the above equation when y is equal to zero. q is max. Hence the shear stress topmost fibre of rectangular section is zero.
2. 1 GPA = ____________ pa.
a) 105
b) 106
c) 108
d) 109
d
In the same way 1 kilo Pascal equal to 103 pascals
1 mega Pascal is equal to 106 pascals.
3. The maximum shear stress in an I section is __________
a) F/8I ×[B/b (D2-d2)+d2] 
b) F/6I ×[B/b (D2-d2)+d2] 
c) F/8I ×[B/b (D3-d3)+d2] 
d) F/4I ×[B/b (D2-d2)+d2] 
a
Shear stress at the junction of web and flange= B/b ×F/8I (D2-d2).
Shear stress at bottom of the flange = F/8I (D2-d2).
And shear force is maximum at neutral axis i.e F/8I ×[B/b (D2-d2)+d2].
4. Find the modulus of section of square beam of size 150 × 150 mm?
a) 654.5m3
b) 550.85m3
c) 562.5m3
d) 586.9m3
c
Moment of inertia for square section = a4/12; y=a/2.
Section modulus Z = I/y = a3/6 = 1503/6 = 562.5 ×103 mm3.
5. In steel sections, the junction between a flange and web is known as ________
a) Edge
b) Fillet
c) Corner
d) Lug
b
6. The percentage of carbon in structural steel is __________

b) 0.6 – 0.85 %
c) 0.7 – 1.23 %
d) 1.23 – 1.45%
a
7. The minimum percentage elongation for mild steel is __________
a) 6%
b) 13%
c) 23%
d) 34%
c
8. GOST standards are used in _________
a) Italy
b) Poland
c) Russia
d) Pakistan
c
It usually carries two part number, one indicates serial number and other indicates the year of issue
For example;  GOST 155-70.
9. The allowable tensile stresses in steel structures is taken as 1500 kg /cm2 to ______
a) 1765 kg /cm2
b) 1900 kg /cm2
c) 2125 kg /cm2
d) 2455 kg/cm2
c
10. As per IS:800, the minimum thickness of web should not be less than ______
a) d/250
b) d/300
c) d/350
d) d/125
a
11. The failing of a very long column is initially by ___________
a) Crushing
b) Collapsing
c) Buckling
d) Twisting
c
12. What is the allowable stress in cast iron?
a) 3200 N/mm2
b) 2400 N/mm2
c) 3400 N/mm2
d) 5500 N/mm2
d
Position
Stress (N/mm2)
Rankine’s Constant
Mild steel
3200
1/7500
Wrought iron
2500
1/9000
Cast iron
5500
1/1600
13. Modulus of resilience is defined as __________
a) Resilience at ultimate stress
b) Resilience per unit volume
c) Resilience at proportional limit
d) Resilience at elastic limit
b
14. A spring used to absorb shocks and vibrations is called as _______
a) Conical spring
b) Leaf spring
c) Disc spring
d) Torsion spring
b
15. A rectangular beam of 500 mm wide is subjected to maximum shear force of 250kN, the corresponding maximum shear stress been 3 N/mm2. The depth of the beam is equal to ______
a) 200mm
b) 250mm
c) 300mm
d) 350mm
b
In rectangular sections; Maximum shear force = 3/2 ×[F/bd]
   &  3 = 3/2 ×[250 ×103/ 500 × d]
        d = 250mm.
