1. Calculate the hoop stress at the bottom of penstock, if a steel penstock of 1 m and 10 mm thick is subjected to 100m head of water. Take w = 9.81 kN/m3.
a) 49 N/mm2
b) 47 N/mm2
c) 45 N/mm2
d) 43 N/mm2
a
Hoop stress = pd/2t = 0.981 ×1000/2×10 = 49 N/mm2.
2. Maximum daily demand = _____ × Average daily demand.
a) 2.5
b) 3.5
c) 1.5
d) 4
c
Maximum daily demand = 1.5 × Average daily demand.
3. Which of the following is not a short term estimate in population forecast?
a) Graphical comparison
b) Geometrical increase method
c) Arithmetical increase method
d) Graphical extension method
a
4. Pn = P[1+r/100]n is a formula used in ___________
a) Arithmetical increase method
b) Incremental increase method
c)  Geometrical increase method
d) Graphical extension method
c
 The formula used is Pn = P[1+r/100]n; Where Pn = population of “n” decades
r = percentage rate of increase per year
n = number of years or decades.
5. According to Freeman, estimate of fire demand can be made from the formula?
a) Q = 3175 P
b) Q = 2125 P
c) Q = 1136.5 (P/5 +10)
d) Q = 2715 (P/5 + 10)
c
Q = 1136.5 ( P/5 + 10 )
Q = quantity of water in litres per minute
P = population in thousands.
6. Fire hydrants are located in a main at a distance of ______________
a) 200 to 250 m
b) 150 to 200 m
c) 100 to 150 m
d) 50 to 100 m
c
7. In total consumption, losses account about __________
a) 10
b) 15
c) 30
d) 25
b
Types of consumption
Percentage varies
Industrial and commercial demand
25 %
Public demand
15 %
Losses
15 %
8. _______ is integrated or summation hydrograph.
a) Mass curve
b) Mild curve
c) Ryve’s curve
d) Dicken’s curve
a
9. ___________ is an example of a subsurface source.
a) Streams
b) Impounding reservoir
c) Rivers
d)  Springs
d
10. Infiltration wells are ____________ wells constructed in series.
a) Vertical
b) Horizontal
c) Inclined
d) Radial
a
11. _______ are the horizontal tunnels laid along the banks of river.
a) Infiltration wells
b) infiltration reservoir
c) infiltration galleries
d) infiltration Springs
c
12. Carbonic acid is high in ______ springs.
a) Gravity
b) Surface
c) Artesian
d) Erotic
b
13. In _________ springs, that  trench acts as a storage reservoir.
a) Surface
b) Erotic
c) Artesian
d) Gravity
d
14. Which of the following wells are also known as water table well?
a) Deep wells
b) Open wells
c) Shallow wells
d) Sunk wells
c
15. Calculate the strain energy of a member bearing stress of 0.0366 N/mm2.  If the length of the member is 1 m and a cross section area is 60000mm2. Take E = 2 × 105 N/mm2.
a) 0.4 Nmm
b) 0.5 Nmm
c) 0.6 Nmm
d) 0.2 Nmm
d
                          = (0.0366)2 / 2 × 2 × 105 × ( 60000) × 1000
                           = 0.2 Nmm.
