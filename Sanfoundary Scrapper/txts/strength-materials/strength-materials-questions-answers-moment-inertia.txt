1. The axis about which moment of area is taken is known as ____________
a) Axis of area
b) Axis of moment
c) Axis of reference
d) Axis of rotation
c
2. Point, where the total volume of the body is assumed to be concentrated is ____________
a) Center of area
b) Centroid of volume
c) Centroid of mass
d) All of the mentioned
b
3. What is MOI?
a) ml2
b) mal
c) ar2
d) None of the mentioned
c
            M = mass, a = area, l =  length, r = distance.
4. What is the formula of radius of gyration?
a) k2 = I/A
b) k2 = I2/A
c) k2 = I2/A2
d) k2 = (I/A)1/2
a
5. What is the formula of theorem of perpendicular axis?
a) Izz = Ixx – Iyy
b) Izz = Ixx + Ah2
c) Izz – Ixx = Iyy
d) None of the mentioned
c
 Izz – Ixx = Iyy.
6. What is the formula of theorem of parallel axis?
a) IAD = IG + Ah
b) IAB = Ah2 + IG
c) IAB = IG – Ah2
d) IAB = IG + Ixx
b
        IAB = Ah2 + IG. 
7. What is the unit of radius of gyration?
a) m4
b) m
c) N
d) m2
b
         So its unit will be m.
8. What will be the the radius of gyration of a circular plate of diameter 10cm?
a) 1.5cm
b) 2.0cm
c) 2.5cm
d) 3cm
c
              The area of circle = 78.57 cm,
           Radius of gyration = (I/A)1/2  =  2.5 cm.
