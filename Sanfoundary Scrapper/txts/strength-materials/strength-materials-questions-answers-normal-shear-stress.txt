1. In the given figure a stepped column carries loads. What will be the maximum normal stress in the column at B in the larger diameter column if the ratio of P/A here is unity?
a) 1/1.5
b) 1
c) 2/1.5
d) 2
c
                         = (P + P) / 1.5 A = 2P/ 1.5A = 2/1.5.
2. The stress which acts in a direction perpendicular to the area is called ____________
a) Shear stress
b) Normal stress
c) Thermal stress
d) None of the mentioned
b
3. Which of these are types of normal stresses?
a) Tensile and compressive stresses
b) Tensile and thermal stresses
c) Shear and bending
d) Compressive and plane stresses
a
4. In a body loaded under plane stress conditions, what is the number of independent stress components?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 6
c
5. If a bar of large length when held vertically and subjected to a load at its lower end, its won-weight produces additional stress. The maximum stress will be ____________
a) At the lower cross-section
b) At the built-in upper cross-section
c) At the central cross-section
d) At every point of the bar
b
6. Which type of stress does in a reinforcement bar is taken by the concrete?
a) Tensile stress
b) Compressive stress
c) Shear stress
d) Bending stress
b
7. A material has a Poisson’s ratio of 0.5. If uniform pressure of 300GPa is applied to that material, What will be the volumetric strain of it?
a) 0.50
b) 0.20
c) 0.25
d) Zero
d
Here the value of μ is 0.5 so 1 – 2 * 0.5 becomes zero.
Therefore whatever be the stress the value of volumetric strain will be zero. 
8. A diagram which shows the variations of the axial load for all sections of the pan of a beam is called ____________
a) Bending moment diagram
b) Shear force diagram
c) Thrust diagram
d) Stress diagram
d
9. The stress induced in a body, when subjected to two equal and opposite forces which are acting tangentially across the resisting section resulting the shearing of the body across its section is called ____________
a) Bending stress
b) Compressive stress
c) Shear strain
d) Shear stress
d
10. What is the formula for shear stress?
a) Shear resistance/shear area
b) Force/unit area
c) Bending strain/area
d) Shear stress/length
a
11. Which of the following stresses are associated with the tightening of a nut on a bolt?
P. Crushing and shear stress in threads
Q. Bending stress due to the bending of bolt
R. Torsional shear stress due to frictional resistance between the nut and the bolt
Select the correct answer using the codes given below:
a) P and Q
b) P and R
c) Only P
d) Only R
a
12. The transverse shear stress acting in a beam of rectangular cross-section, subjected to a transverse shear load, is ____________
a) variable with maximum at the bottom of the beam
b) Variable with maximum at the top of the beam
c) Uniform
d) Variable with maximum on the neutral axis
d
 So, transverse shear stress is variable with a maximum in the neutral axis.  
13. A block 100mm x 100mm base and 10mm height. What will the direct shear stress in the element when a tangential force of 10kN is applied to the upper edge to a displacement 1mm relative to lower face?
a) 1Pa
b) 1MPa
c) 10MPa
d) 100Pa
b
