1. A circular shaft of diameter 30 mm is tested under torsion the gauge length of test specimen is 300 mm. A torque of 2kNm produces an angle twist of 1°. Calculate CJ.
a) 0.432 × 106 N/mm2
b) 0.324  × 106 N/mm2
c) 0.46  × 106 N/mm2
d) 0.532  × 106 N/mm2
a
Polar moment of inertia = π/32 × 304mm4.
To find CJ: T/J =C× twist angle
C = Tl/J×twist angle = 2×106 ×300 / π/32 × 304mm4× π/180.
C = 0.4323 × 106 N/mm2.
