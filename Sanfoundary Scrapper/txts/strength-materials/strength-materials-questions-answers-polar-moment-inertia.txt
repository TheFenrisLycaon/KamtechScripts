1. The moment of inertia of a plane area with respect to an axis ____________ to the plane is called a polar moment of inertia.
a) Parallel
b) Perpendicular
c) Equal
d) Opposite
b
2. What are the units of Polar modulus?
a) mm3
b) mm2
c) mm
d) mm4
a
3. What is the polar modulus for solid shaft?
a) π/16 D2
b) π/12 D3
c) π/ 16 D3
d) π/16 D
c
                                                   Z = π/16 D3.
4. Calculate the polar moment of inertia for a solid circular shaft of 30 mm diameter.
a) 76m4
b) 79.5m4
c) 81m4
d) 84m4
b
Polar moment of inertia = J = π/32 × (30)4 mm4
                                               J = 79.52 m4.
5. A hollow shaft outside diameter 120 mm and thickness 20 mm. Find polar moment of inertia.
a) 16.36 × 106 mm4
b) 18.45 × 106 mm4
c) 21.3 × 106 mm4
d) 22.5 × 106 mm4
a
the polar moment of inertia = π/32 × (1204– 804).
                                                   J = 16.36 × 106 mm4.

6. Determine the maximum flood discharge from a catchment area of 40.25 km2 and it is situated in the Western Ghats.
a) 350 cumecs
b) 375 cumecs
c) 400 cumecs
d) 425 cumecs
c
Q = CA3/4
Q = 25×(40.25)3/4
Q = 400 cumecs.
