a
3. Three sections in a beam are of equal length of 100mm. All three sections are pulled axially with 50kN and due to it elongated by 0.2mm. What will be the resultant strain in the beam?
a) 0.002
b) 0.004
c) 0.006
d) 0.020
c
        This strain will be for one section. By the principle of superposition the resultant strain will be the algebraic sum of individual strains I.e. = 0.002 + 0.002 + 0.002 = 0.006.
4. Two sections in a bar of length 10cm and 20cm respectively are pulled axially. It causes an elongation of 0.2mm and 0.4mm respectively in each section. What will be the resultant strain in the bar?
a) sd0.004
b) 0.002
c) 0.003
d) 0.006
a
     In column 1, strain = 0.2/100 = 0.002
     In column 2, strain = 0.4/200 = 0.002
  Resultant strain = 0.002 + 0.002 = 0.004.
5. A composite bar have four sections each of length 100mm, 150mm, 200mm, 250mm. When force is applied, all the sections causes an elongation of 0.1mm. What will the resultant strain in the bar?
a) 0.0012
b) 0.00154
c) 0.00256
d) 0.0020
c
           Strain in section 2 = 0.1/150
           Strain In section 3 = 0.1/200
           Strain in section 4 = 0.1/250
Resultant strain = 0.001+0.0006+0.0005+0.0004 = 0.00256.
6. A brass bar, having cross sectional area of 100mm2, is subjected to axial force of 50kN. The length of two sections is 100mm and 200mm respectively. What will be the total elongation of bar if E = 1.05 x 105 N/mm2 ?
a) 1.21mm
b) 2.034mm
c) 2.31mm
d) 1.428mm
d
          Elongation In section 2 =  P/AE  x L = 50,000/(100×1.05×100,000)  x 200 = 0.952mm
      Total elongation = 0.476 + 0.952 = 1.428mm.
7. A composite bar having two sections of cross-sectional area 100mm2 and 200mm2 respectively. The length of both the sections is 100mm. What will be the total elongation of bar if it is subjected to axial force of 100kN and E = 105 N/mm2?
a) 1.0
b) 1.25
c) 1.5
d) 2.0
c
           Elongation in section 2 = 100,000 x 100 / 100000x 200 = 0.5
          Total elongation = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5mm.
8. A bar having two sections of cross sectional area of 100mm2 and 200mm2 respectively. The length of both the sections is 200mm. What will be the total strain in the bar if it is subjected to axial force of 100kN and E = 105 N/mm2?
a) 0.010
b) 0.015
c) 0.020
d) 0.030
b
           Strain is section 2 = P / AE = 100,000 /  200×100000 = 0.005
     Resultant strain in the bar = 0.010 + 0.005 = 0.015mm.
9. A brass bar, having cross sectional area of 150mm2, is subjected to axial force of 50kN. What will be the total strain of bar if E= 1.05 x 104 N/mm2?
a) 0.062mm
b) 0.025mm
c) 0.068mm
d) 0.054mm
d
          Strain In section 2 =  P/AE  = 50,000/(100×1.05×100,000)  = 0.031mm
       Resultant strain = 0.031 + 0.031  =  0.062mm.
 Here the calculation of strain does not requires the value of lengths of the sections.
10. A composite bar of two sections of each of length 100mm, 150mm. When force is applied, all the sections causes an elongation of 0.1mm. What will the resultant strain in the bar?
a) 0.0016
b) 0.00154
c) 0.00256
d) 0.0020
a
           Strain in section 2= 0.1/150
Resultant strain = 0.001+0.0006 = 0.0016.
11. If the given forces P1, P2, P3, P4,and P5 which are co planar and concurrent are such that the force polygon does not close, then the system will
a) Be in equilibrium
b) Always reduce to a resultant force
c) Always reduce to a couple
d) Always be in equilibrium and will always reduce to a couple
b
