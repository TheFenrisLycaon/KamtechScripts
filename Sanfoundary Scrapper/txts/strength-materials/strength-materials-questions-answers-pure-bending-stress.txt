1. In simply supported beams, the _____ stress distribution is not uniform.
a) Bending
b) Shearing
c) Tensile
d) Compressive
a
2. The maximum _________ stresses occur at top most fibre of a simply supported beam.
a) Tensile
b) Compressive
c) Shear
d) Bending
b
3. The stress is directly proportional to _______
a) E
b) u
c) y
d) R
c
Equating both equations; we get e = f/E  = y/R
Hence stress (f) is directly proportional to the distance from neutral axis(y).
4. At the extreme fibre, bending stress is______
a) Minimum
b) Zero
c) Constant
d) Maximum
d
5. The curvature of a beam is equal to _____
a) EI/M
b) M/E
c) M/EI
d) E/MI
c
Where R is called “radius of curvature “
 1/R is called “curvature of the beam “.
So, 1/R = M/EI.
So curvature of the beam is directly proportional to bending moment.
6. Skin stress is also called as ______
a) Shear stress
b) Bending stress
c) Lateral stress
d) Temperature stress
b
7. _________ is the total Strain energy stored in a body.
a) modulus of resilience
b) impact energy
c) resilience
d) proof resilience
c
8. In cantilever beams, there is _______ stress above neutral axis.
a) Compressive
b) Tensile
c) Temperature
d) Shear
b
9. The product of modulus of elasticity (E) and polar moment of inertia (J) is called torsional rigidity.
a) True
b) False
b
10. Calculate the maximum stress due to Bending in a steel strip of 30 mm thick and 60 mm wide is bent around a circular drum of 3.6 m diameter   [Take Young’s modulus = 200kN/m2].
a) 2341.76 N/mm2
b) 1666.67 N/mm2
c) 5411.76 N/mm2
d) 4666.67 N/mm2
b
R = 3.6/2  = 1.8 m
E = 200 kN/m2
y = 30/2 = 15 mm
E/R = f/y ;        f = 200000×15/1800
= 1666.67 N/mm2.
11. The strength of beams depend merely on________
a) Modulus section
b) Moment of inertia
c) Flexural rigidity
d) Moment of resistance
a
12. The steel plate is bent into a circular path of radius 10 metres. If the plate section be 120 mm wide and 20 mm thick, then calculate the maximum bending stress.  [Consider Young’s modulus = 200000 N/mm2].
a) 350 N/mm2
b) 400 N/mm2
c) 200 N/mm2
d) 500 N/mm2
c
By bending equation we have E/R = f/y
 f = 200000×10 / 10000
   = 200 N/mm2.
