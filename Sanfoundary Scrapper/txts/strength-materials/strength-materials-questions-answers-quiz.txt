1. The Velocity at which flow changes from viscous to turbulent is called __________ velocity.
a) Critical
b) Frictional
c) Relative
d) Nominal
a
2. Flow in circular pipes will be turbulent is Reynolds number is _________
a) < 2800
b) > 2800
c) = 2800
d) ~ 2800
b
V = Mean velocity of flow in pipe
d = Diameter of pipe
v = Kinematic viscosity of liquid
Flow in circular pipe will be turbulent if Reynolds number is greater than 2800.
3. _____ number is the ratio between inertia and viscous forces.
a) Lamina’s
b) Parker’s
c) Macadam’s
d) Reynold’s
d
4. The frictional resistance is ______ to the surface area of contact.
a) Inversely proportional
b) Directly proportional
c) Equal
d) Not equal
b
5. ___________ flow the liquid particles move along straight parallel paths.
a) Steady
b) Unsteady
c) Laminar
d) Turbulent
c
6. The __________ resistance is independent of the nature of surface contact.
a) Frictional
b) Skid
c) Shear
d) Coupling
a
7. Calculate the specific weight of oil. If the specific gravity is 0.95. Take specific weight of water is 1000 kg/m3.
a) 750 kg/m3
b) 850 kg/m3
c) 950 kg/m3
d) 1250 kg/m3
c
                         Specific weight of oil = S × specific weight of water
                   Specific weight of oil = 0.95 × 1000
                                                         = 950 kg/m3.
8. In _______ liquid flows under atmospheric pressure.
a) Pipe flow
b) Open channel
c) Stream

b) Parallel
c) Perpendicular
d) Unequal
a
10. Aqueduct is an example of __________ channel.
a) Natural
b) Prismatic
c) Non prismatic
d) Artificial
d
11. Rectangular channel is  _________ channel.
a) non Prismatic
b) Prismatic
c) Natural
d) Artificial
b
12. Expand RVF _________
a) Rapid Vary Fluid
b) Rise in Virtual Flow
c) Rapidly Varied flow
d) Rapidly Viscous flow
c
13. Froude number is the ratio of inertial force to the _________ force.
a) Shear
b) Gravity

d) Viscous
b
Fr = V/(gD)1/2.
14. For super critical flow, Fr _________ 1.
a) >
b) <
c) =
d) ~
a
Fr = V/(gD) 1/2
For supercritical flow, Fr > 1.
15. Strut is a tension member.
a) True
b) False
b
