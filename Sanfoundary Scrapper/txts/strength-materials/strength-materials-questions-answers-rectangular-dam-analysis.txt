1. Calculate the self-weight of the masonry of the rectangle dam of 10 m height and 4 m wide. Consider specific weight of masonry as 20kN/m3.
a) 600 kN
b) 500 kN
c) 800 kN
d) 1000 kN
c
                                                                         = (10×4)×1×20 = 800 kN.
2. Water-cement ratio varies normally from ______________ to __________
a) 0.42 – 0.45
b) 0.45 – 0.48
c) 0.42 – 0.48
d) 0.45 – 0.5
c
3. Calculate the resultant force of dam with given self weight 800kN and water pressure be 500kN.
a) 943.4 kN
b) 956.7 kN
c) 948.6 kN
d) 939.1 KN
a
                                                           = (5002 + 8002)1/2
                                                           = 943.39 ~ 943.4 kN.

d) 1:4:8
b
Grade of concrete
Mix proportionate
M10
1:3:6
M15
1:2:4
M20

a
8. As per IS, the standard dimensions for a brick is _______ (in cm).
a) 19×8×8
b) 19×9×8
c) 19×9×9
d) 19×8×9
c
9. Formation of white patches on the surface on the bricks is  ____________

b) False
a
11. ______ bricks can withstand up to a temperature of 1800°C.
a) Refractory
b) Fly ash
c) Clay
d) Cement
a
12. According to IS, the minimum expansion joint in construction should be ________
a) 18mm to 30 mm
b) 15mm to 24mm
c) 18mm to 25mm
d) 22mm to 30mm
c
13. The edges formed by the intersection of plane surfaces of a brick are known as _________
a) Arises
b) Stretcher
c) Header
d) Frog
a
14. The depression made in the face of brick during its manufacture is _________
a) Brick tile
b) Bat
c) Frog
d) Quoin closer
c
15. Calculate the eccentricity of a rectangular dam of width 4 m. Take the distance between the water face and point where resultant cuts the base as 5.25 m.
a) 2.25m
b) 3.25m
c) 4.35m
d) 5.35m
b
 Where Z = 5.25 m   &   b = 4m ; Now, e = Z- b/2
 e = 5.25 – 4/2
     = 3.25m.
