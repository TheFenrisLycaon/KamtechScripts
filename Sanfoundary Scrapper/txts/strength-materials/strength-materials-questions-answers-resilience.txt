b) Resilience
c) Plasticity
d) Strain resistance
b
2. The strain energy stored in a specimen when stained within the elastic limit is known as __________
a) Resilience
b) Plasticity
c) Malleability
d) Stain energy
a
3. The maximum strain energy stored at elastic limit is __________
a) Resilience
b) Proof resilience
c) Elasticity
d) Malleability
b
4. The mathematical expression for resilience ‘U’ is __________
a) U = σ2/E  x volume
b) U = σ2/3E  x volume
c) U = σ2/2E  x volume
d) U = σ/2E  x volume
c
            U = σ2/2E  x volume.
5. What is the modulus of resilience?
a) The ratio of resilience to volume
b) The ratio of proof resilience to the modulus of elasticity
c) The ratio of proof resilience to the strain energy
d) The ratio of proof resilience to volume
d
6. The property by which an amount of energy is absorbed by material without plastic deformation is called __________
a) Toughness
b) Impact strength
c) Ductility
d) Resilience
d
7. Resilience of a material plays important role in which of the following?
a) Thermal stress
b) Shock loading
c) Fatigue
d) Pure static loading
b
8. A steel has its yield strength of 200N/mm2 and modulus of elasticity of 1x105MPa. Assuming the material to obey hookes law up to yielding, what will be its proof resilience?
a) 0.8 N/mm2
b) 0.4 N/mm2
c) 0.2 N/mm2
d) 0.6 N/mm2
c
9. A 1m long bar of uniform section extends 1mm under limiting axial stress of 200N/mm2. What is the modulus of resilience for the bar?
a) 0.1 units
b) 1 units
c) 10units
d) 100units
a
               Therefore, u = 200×1 / 2×1000 = 0.1units.
10. A square steel bar of 10mm side and 5m length is subjected to a load whereupon it absorbs a strain energy of 100J. what is its modulus of resilience?
a) 1/5 N-mm/mm3
b) 25 N-mm/mm3
c) 1/25 N-mm/mm3
d) 5 N-mm/mm3
a
       u = U/v
         = ( 100 x 1000 ) / ( 10 x 10x 5x 1000)
         = 1/5 N-mm/mm3.
