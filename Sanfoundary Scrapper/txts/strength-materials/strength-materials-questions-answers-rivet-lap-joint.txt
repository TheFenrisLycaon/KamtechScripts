1. What is the ratio of maximum deflection to maximum bending stress if a simply supported rectangular beam of span “L” and it carries a central load W.
a) L2/12 Ed
b) L2/10 Ed
c) L2/ 4 Ed
d) L2/ 6 Ed
d
y= Wl3/48E (bd3/12)
y/f = l2/ 6Ed.
2. In a cantilever of span subjected to a point load of w acting at a distance of (1/3) L  from  free end. The deflection under load will be
a) WL3/81 EI
b) 14WL3/ 81EI
c) 8WL3/81EI
d) WL3/64 EI
c
= 8WL3/81EI.
3. The slabs whose corners are prevented from lifting are known as _________
a) simply supported
b) cantilever
c) restrained
d) suspended
c

a) Tension
b) Shear
c) Torsional
d) Longitudinal
c
5. Which of the following layout is used for “Direct- Indirect system”.
a) Radial system
b) Grid system
c) Reticulated system
d) Interlaced system
a
6. ________ layout is best suited for well planned towns.
a) Tree system
b) Ring system
c) Reticulated system
d) Radial system
b
7. A ___ is used to prevent water from flowing back in the opposite direction.
a) Sluice valve
b) Check valve
c) Air valve
d) Drain valve
b
8. Scour valve in water distribution system is provided at ________
a) High points
b) Junction points
c) Low points
d) Key points
c
9. _______ valves are known as “Washout ” valves.
a) Drain valves
b) Scour valves
c) Check valves
d) Sluice valves
a
10. Check valve is provided on the delivery side of a pipe.
a) False
b) True
b
11. _____ reduces the pipe size from larger to smaller bore.
a) Aqua phone
b) Tee
c) Elbow
d) Reducer
d
12. The maximum pressure in (kg/cm2) to which cast iron pipes may be subjected is _________
a) 3
b) 7
c) 11
d) 14
b
13. The pipe extending from a stop cock to the storage tank is called ________

c) Street main
d) Distribution pipe
a
14. Calculate the elongation of the rod if you still out of 490 mm square area and 600 M long are subjected to an axial pull of 40 kN. Take E = 2×105N/mm2.
a) 0.56 mm
b) 0.78 mm
c) 0.24 mm
d) 0.16 mm
c
The Elongation = Pl / AE
                            = 40000 × 600 / 490 × 2×102
                            = 0.24 mm.

a) Lateral strain
b) Linear strain
c) Longitudinal strain
d) Volumetric strain
a
