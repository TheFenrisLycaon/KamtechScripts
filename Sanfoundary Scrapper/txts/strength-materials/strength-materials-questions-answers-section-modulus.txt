1. What is the section modulus (Z) for a rectangular section?
a) bd2/6
b) a3/6
c) BD3-bd3
d) D4-d4
a
Z= I/y ;   For rectangular section, I = bd3/12    &    y = d/2.
Z= bd2/6.
2. Find the modulus of section of square beam of size 300×300 mm.
a) 4.8 × 106 mm3
b) 4.5 × 106 mm3
c) 5.6  × 106 mm3
d) 4.2  × 106 mm3
b
I = a4/12.      y= a/2.
Z = I/y = a3/6
            = 3003/6
            = 4.5 × 106 mm3.
3. _________ of a beam is a measure of its resistance against deflection.
a) Strength
b) Stiffness
c) Deflection
d) Slope
b
4. To what radius an Aluminium strip 300 mm wide and 40mm thick can be bent, if the maximum stress in a strip is not to exceed 40 N/mm2. Take young’s modulus for Aluminium is 7×105 N/mm2.
a) 45m
b) 52m
c) 35m
d) 65m
c
d= 40mm.   y= 20mm.
From the relation; E/R = f/y
R= E×y/f
   =70×103 × 20 / 40
   = 35m.
5. The bending stress in a beam is ______ to bending moment.
a) Less than
b) Directly proportionate
c) More than
d) Equal
b
6. The Poisson’s ratio for concrete is __________
a) 0.4
b) 0.35
c) 0.12
d) 0.2
d
7. The term “Tenacity” means __________
a) Working stress
b) Ultimate stress
c) Bulk modulus
d) Shear modulus
b
8. A steel rod of 25 mm diameter and 600 mm long is subjected to an axial pull of 40000. The intensity of stress is?
a) 34.64 N/mm2
b) 46.22 N/mm2
c) 76.54 N/mm2
d) 81.49  N/mm2
d
The intensity of stress = P/A = 40000/490.87
                                                   = 81.49 N/mm2.
9. The bending strain is zero at _______
a) Point of contraflexure
b) Neutral axis
c) Curvature
d) Line of action of loading
b
10. Strength of the beam depends only on the cross section.
a)  True
b)  False
b
