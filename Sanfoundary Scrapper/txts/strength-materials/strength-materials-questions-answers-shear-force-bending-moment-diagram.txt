1. What is the bending moment at end supports of a simply supported beam?
a) Maximum
b) Minimum
c) Zero
d) Uniform
c
2. What is the maximum shear force, when a cantilever beam is loaded with udl throughout?
a) w×l
b) w
c) w/l
d) w+l
a
3. Sagging, the bending moment occurs at the _____ of the beam.
a) At supports
b) Mid span
c) Point of contraflexure
d) Point of emergence
b
4. What will be the variation in BMD for the diagram? [Assume l = 2m].
a) Rectangular
b) Trapezoidal
c) Triangular
d) Square
c
By joining the base line, free end and maximum BM point. We obtain a right angled triangle.
5. What is the maximum bending moment for simply supported beam carrying a point load “W” kN at its centre?
a) W kNm
b) W/m kNm
c) W×l kNm
d) W×l/4 kNm
d
Moment at A = Moment at B = 0
Moment at C = W/2  ×  l/2 = Wl/ 4 kNm (Sagging).
6. How do point loads and udl be represented in SFD?
a) Simple lines and curved lines
b) Curved lines and inclined lines
c) Simple lines and inclined lines
d) Cant represent any more
c
Point load      =     ———–
Udl    load       =     \
7. ________ curve is formed due to bending of over hanging beams.
a) Elastic
b) Plastic
c) Flexural
d) Axial
a
8. The relation between slope and maximum bending moment is _________
a) Directly proportion
b) Inversely proportion
c) Relative proportion
d) Mutual incidence
b
9. What is the SF at support B?
a) 5 kN
b) 3 kN
c) 2 kN
d) 0 kN
d
Shear force at A = 4 kN ( same between A and C )
Shear force at C = 4 kN
Shear force at B  = 0 kN
Maximum SF at A = 4 kN.
10. Where do the maximum BM occurs for the below diagram.
a) -54 kNm
b) -92 kNm
c) -105 kNm
d) – 65 kNm
c
Moment at C = – (10 × 3) × (3/2)
                         = – 45 kNm
Moment at A = – (10 × 3) × (1.5 + 2 )
Maximum BM at A  = – 105 kNm
                                   =   105 Nm (hogging).
