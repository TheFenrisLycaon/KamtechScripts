11. The maximum flood discharge is also known as ___________
a) Peak flow
b) Maximum flow
c) Peak discharge
d) Peak flood
a
12. Which of the following method is used to estimate maximum flood discharge?
a) By travelling screen
b) By current meter

d) By salt velocity
c
13.  ________formula is used only in southern India for calculating maximum flood discharge.
a) Dickens
b) Ryve’s
c) Lacey’s
d) Francis
b
Q = C(A)2/3.
The coefficient “C” depends on the maximum intensity of rainfall and other factors such as shape slopes exedra of the catchment.
14. A catchment area of 30.5 km2 is situated in Central India calculate the maximum discharge coming from the catchment area.
a) 253.08 cumecs
b) 341.06 cumecs
c) 457.88 cumecs
