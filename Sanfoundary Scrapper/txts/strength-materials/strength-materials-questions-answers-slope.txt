c
3. Which of the following method is not used for determining slope and deflection at a point?
a) Moment area method
b) Double integration method
c) Isoheytal method
d) Macaulay’s method
c
4. The slope is denoted by _______
a) k
b) y
c) i
d) c
c
•It is denoted by “i”.
5. Calculate the slope at supports, if the area is 180kNm2. Take flexural rigidity as 50000.
a) 0.0054 radians
b) 0.0072 radians
c) 0.0036 radians
