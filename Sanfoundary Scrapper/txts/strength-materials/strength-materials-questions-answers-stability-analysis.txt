1. To ensure economy in dam sections, the ______ should be minimum.
a) Base width
b) Top width
c) Spillway length
d) Toe of the wall
a
2. Calculate the maximum stress at the base section is the self weight is 4400 kN. The top and bottom width of them are 3 and 8 m respectively. Take (e) = 2.97.
a) 1658.15 kN/m2
b) 1775.12 kN/m2
c) 1897.45 kN/m2
d) 2336.67 kN/m2
b
P= 4400/8 (1+6×2.97/8)
   = 1775.125 kN/m2.
3. If the maximum stress is positive, then the nature of stress is ____
a) Tensile
b) Shearing
c) Compressive
d) Bending
c
4. Determine the eccentricity of the dam section, if the base width of the dam be 6m. Take Z = 5.5m.
a) 2.5
b) 1.5
c) 3.5
d) 4.5
a
                           = 5.5 – 6/2
                            = 5.5 – 3
                             = 2.5 m.
5. Calculate the minimum stress developed at the heel of the dam, if the self weight of the dam is 924 kN and the base with is 6 metres [Take e = 0.0945m].
a) 145 kN/m2
b) 139 kN/m2
c) 167 kN/m2
d) 183 kN/m2
b
= 920/6 ×(1-6×0.0945/6).
= 139 kN/m2.
6. The side slopes depend on ____________ conditions of a proposed dam.
a) Toe width
b) Height of foundation
c) Character of material
d) Free board allowance
c
1.Height of the dam
2.Character of material
3.Nature of foundation.
7. Molitor’s formula can be used for calculation of ___________
a) Freeboard
b) Toe width
c) Wave height
d) Base drop
c
It can be calculated using 0.032(VF)1/2.
8. The height of the dam = free board + ___________
a) FTL
b) MWL
c) FRL
d) HFL
d
Height of the dam = HFL + free board.
9. _____________ sections allow the surplus discharge to flow in dams.
a) Mulching
b) Over reinforced
c) Breaching
d) Balanced
c
10. If the minimum stress developed is negative, then the nature of stress is ___________
a) Shearing
b) Tensile
c) Bending
d) Compressive
b
11. ____________ creates concentrated seepage in dams section.
a) Longitudinal cracks
b) Transverse cracks
c) Construction cracks
d) Contraction cracks
b

b) 3:1
c) 2.5:1
d) 1.5:1
c
For:
1. Homogeneous well graded – 2.5 : 1
2. Homogeneous coarse silt     – 3 : 1
3. Sand and gravel with RCC core wall – 2.5 :  1.
13. Major distributaries discharge varies from ____________
a) 0.25 to 5 cumecs
b) 2 to 4 cumecs
c) 1.5 to 5 cumecs
d) 1.2 to 5 cumecs
a
14. Field channels are also known as ______
