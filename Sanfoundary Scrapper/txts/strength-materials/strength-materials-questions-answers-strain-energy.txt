1. Resilience can also be termed as ___________
a) Stress energy
b) Strain energy
c) Modulus
d) Tenacity
b
2. Mathematically, strain energy = _________
a) Power
b) Work done
c) Young’s Modulus
d) Energy
b
3. Calculate the Strain energy stored in a body of stress 0.0366 N/mm2. The cross sectional area is 60 m2and length of body is 1 m. Take E = 2×105 N/mm2.
a) 0.2009 N.mm
b) 0.0416 N.mm
c) 0.0987 N.mm
d) 0.1316 N.mm
a
Strain energy stored = f2/2EI  × Volume
                                      = (0.0366)2/ 2×2×105× (200×300) × (1000)
                                      = 0 2009 N.mm.
