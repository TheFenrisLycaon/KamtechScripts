d
3. A tensile load of 60kN is suddenly applied to a circular bar of 4cm diameter. What will be the maximum instantaneous stress induced?
a) 95.493 N/mm2
b) 45.25 N/mm2
c) 85.64 N/mm2
d) 102.45 N/mm2
a
4. A tensile load of 60kN is suddenly applied to a circular bar of 4cm and 5m length. What will be the strain energy absorbed by the rod if E=2×105 N/mm2?
a) 140.5 N-m
b) 100 N-m
c) 197.45 N-m
d) 143.2 N-m
d
              Strain energy = σ2V/2E = 95.492 x 2×106π / (2x2x105) = 143238 N-mm = 143.23 N-m.
5. A tensile load of 100kN is suddenly applied to a rectangular bar of dimension 2cmx4cm. What will be the instantaneous stress in bar?
a) 100 N/mm2
b) 120 N/mm2
c) 150 N/mm2
d) 250 N/mm2
d
6. 2 tensile load of 100kN is suddenly applied to a rectangular bar of dimension 2cmx4cm and length of 5m. What will be the strain energy absorbed in the bar if E=1×105 N/mm2?
a) 312.5 N-m
b) 314500 N-mm
c) 1250 N-m
d) 634 N-m
c
        Strain energy = σ2V/2E = 250x250x20x40x5000/ (2×100,000) = 1250000 N-mm = 1250 N-m.
7. A steel rod is 2m long and 50mm in diameter. A axial pull of 100kN is suddenly applied to the rod. What will be the instantaneous stress induced in the rod?
a) 101.89 N/mm2
b) 94.25 N/mm2
c) 130.45 N/mm2
d) 178.63 N/mm2
a
          Load = 100kN = 100×1000 N
 Stress = 2 x load / area = 2x100x1000 / (625π) = 101.86 N/mm2.
8. A steel rod is 2m long and 50mm in diameter. An axial pull of 100kN is suddenly applied to the rod. What will be the instantaneous elongation produced in the rod if E=22GN/m2?
a) 0.0097 mm
b) 1.0754 mm
c) 1.6354 mm
d) 1.0186 mm
d
          Load = 100kN = 100×1000 N
        E=22GN/m2 = 200 x 109 / 106 = 200,000 N/mm2
 Stress = 2 x load / area = 2x100x1000 / (625	π )
Elongation = stress x length / E = 101.86×2000 / 200000 = 1.0186 mm.
9. What will be the amount of axial pull be applied on a a 4cm diameter bar to get an instantaneous stress value of 143 N/mm2?
a) 50kN
b) 60kN
c) 70kN
d) 80kN
b
         Load = instantaneous stress x area / 2
             = 143 x 400×3.14 / 2 = 60kN.
10. What will be the instantaneous stress produced in a bar 10cm2 in area ans 4m long by the sudden application of tensile load of unknown magnitude, if the extension of the bar due to suddenly applied load is 1.35mm if E = 2×105 N/mm2?
a) 67.5 N/mm2
b) 47 N/mm2
c) 55.4 N/mm2
d) 78.5 N/mm2
