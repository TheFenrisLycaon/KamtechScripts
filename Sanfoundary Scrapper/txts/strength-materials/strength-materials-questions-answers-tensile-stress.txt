c) Tensile stress
d) Transverse stress
c
3. Which of the following stresses are associated with the tightening of a nut on a bolt?
P. Tensile stress due to the streching of bolt
Q. Bending stress due to the bending of bolt
R. Torsional shear stress due to frictional resistance between the nut and the bolt
Select the correct answer using the codes given below.
a) P and Q
b) P and R
c) Only p
d) R and Q
a
4. In a tensile test, near the elastic limit zone ____________
a) Tensile stress increases in linear proportion to the stress
b) Tensile stress increases at a faster rate
c) Tensile stress decreases at a faster rate
d) None of the mentioned
c
5. Match the following and give the correct code given in options:
List 1
List 2
 A. Tensile test on CI
 1. Plain fracture on a transverse plane
B. Tensile test on MS 
 2. Granular helecoidal fracture 
C. Torsion test on CI
 3. Cup and cone
4. Granular fracture in a transverse plane 
a) A – 1       B – 2    C – 4
b) A – 1       B – 4      C – 2
c) A – 3       B – 1      C – 2
d) A – 3       B – 4      C – 1
d
6. The phenomenon of slow growth of strain under a steady tensile stress is called ____________
a) Yielding
b) Creeping
c) Breaking
d) None of the mentioned
b
7. A rod 150cm long and of diameter 2cm is subjected to an axial pull of 20kN. What will be the stress?
a) 60 N/mm2
b) 65 N/mm2
c) 63.6 N/mm2
d) 71.2 N/mm2
c
           Load = 20,000N
        Area = π/4 (20)2 = 100π mm2.
8. The stress in a rod is 70 N/mm2 and the modulus of elasticity is 2 x 105 N/mm2. what will be the strain in the rod?
a) 0.00052
b) 0.00035
c) 0.00030
d) 0.00047
b
 Here, E = 2 * 105 N/mm2
And, σ = 70 N/mm2
e = 70/2*105 = 0.00035.
9. What will be the minimum diameter of a steel wire, which is used to raise a load of 4000N if the stress in the rod is not to exceed  95 MN/m2?
a) 6mm
b) 6.4mm
c) 7mm
d) 7.3mm
d
             Area = load/stress
       Also, area is π/4 D2 so π/4 D2  = 4000 / 95
        And D = 7.32.
10. A tensile test was conducted on mild steel bar. The load at elastic limit was 250kN and the diameter of the steel bar was 3cm. What will be the value of stress?
a) 35368 x 104 N/m2
b) 32463 x 104 N/m2
c) 35625 x 104 N/m2
d) 37562 x 104 N/m2
a
           Load = 150 x 1000N
          Area = π/4 (0.03)2 m2.
