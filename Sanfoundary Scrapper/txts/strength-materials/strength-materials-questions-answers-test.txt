a
2. If the columns are effectively held in position and restrained against rotation at both ends. Recommend the value of effective length.
a) 0.6×l
b) 0.65×l
c) 0.77×l
d) 0.9×l
b
 [ l = unsupported length of compression member ].
3. A column in which reinforcement is wound spiral is ___________
a) Tied column
b) Spiral column
c) Composite column
d) Short column
b
4. The inclined members carrying compressive loads are ________
a) Pedestal
b) Strut
c) Post
d) Winch
b
5. Polygonal links are also known as _____________
a) Bent up bars
b) Crancked bars
c) Lateral ties
d) Anchorage bars
c
6. The pitch of the lateral ties shall not be more than the least of the ______________
a) 300mm
b) 450mm
c) 500mm
d) 550mm
a
▪ least lateral dimension of the column
▪ sixteen times the diameter of the smallest longitudinal bar
▪ 300 mm.
7. The minimum depth of foundation in all types of soils is _________
a) 350mm
b) 680mm
c) 500mm
d) 280mm
c
8. In T beams, the most of the compressive force is shared by __________
a) Web
b) Flange
c) Rib
d) Neutral axis
b
9. In T beams, maximum ______ is less.
a) Shear force
b) Bending moment
c) Bending stress
d) Shear stress
b
10. In continuous beams ______ moment develops at supports.
a) Hogging
b) Sagging
c) Couple
d) Static
a
11. In continuous beams ______________ moments is always less than support moments.
a) Upward
b) Mid span
c) Downward
d) Sagging
b
12. Lighter materials of construction can be used for a continuous beam.
a) True
b) False
a
13. ________ is a good example for malleability.
a) Glass
b) Concrete
c) Copper
d) Lead
c
14. Determine the working stress in the factor of safety is 3 and ultimate load is what 127.32N?
a) 46 N/m2
b) 55 N/m2
c) 48 N/m2
d) 42 N/m2
d
Given F.O.S = 3 & W = 127.32N
Working stress = 127.32/3
                            = 42.44 N/m2.
15. Volumetric strain = 3× _____________
a) Linear strain
b) Lateral strain
c) Linear stress
d) Lateral stress
a
€v = €xx + €yy + €zz
The volumetric strain will be 3 times the linear strain in any of three axis and €v = 3e
Where (e =  linear strain).
