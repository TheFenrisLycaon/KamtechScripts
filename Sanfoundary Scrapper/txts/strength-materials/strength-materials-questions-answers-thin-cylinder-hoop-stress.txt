1. Which of the following stress can also be known as hoop stress?
a) Axial stress
b) Longitudinal stress
c) Fluid stress
d) Circumferential stress
d
f = pdl/2tl
f = pd/2t.
Circumstantial stress can also be known as hoop stress.
2. A water main of 1.5 m diameter and 20 mm thick is subjected to an pressure of 1.5N/mm2. Calculate the circumferential stress induced in the pipe.
a) 78.65 N/mm2
b) 68.45 N/mm2
c) 56.25  N/mm2
d) 60.85 N/mm2
c
Thickness = 20 mm
Hoop stress = pd/2t = 1500 × 1.5/ 2× 20.
                       = 56.25 N/mm2.
