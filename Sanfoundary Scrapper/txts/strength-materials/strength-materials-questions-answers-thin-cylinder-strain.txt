a) 0.00006
b) 0.0006
c) 0.006
d) 0.06
a
                                                      e = 1.2 ×1000 /2×10×2×105×(1/2 –  0.3)
                                                      e  = 0.00006.

a) True
b) False
a
Q = KH
In this test, the water is first lower down to a safe level. The rise of water level and its corresponding time table is noted in a cross-sectional area of well different levels the yield of the well can be calculated.
14. Calculate thickness of metal, if the pressure inside the water main is 0.6 N/mm2. The diameter of water main is 600 mm. Take hoop stress = 25 N/mm2.
