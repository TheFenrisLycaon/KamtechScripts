a
4. The angle of twist can be written as ________
a) TL/J
b) CJ/TL
c) TL/CJ
d) T/J
c
Where T = Torque in Nm
             L = Length of shaft

a) Rainfall graphs
b) Rainfall records
c) Rainfall curves
d) Rainfall cumulatives
b
11. Estimation of run off “R” is 0.85P-30.48.
The above formula was coined by _____
a) Lacey
b) Darcy
c) Khosla
d) Ingli
d
R= 0.85P-30.48
Where R = annual runoff in mm
             P = annual rainfall in mm.
12.  Monsoon duration factor is denoted by ________
a) P
b) S
c) F
d) T
c
 Class of Monsoon
Monsoon Duration Factor (F)
Very Short
0.5
Standard length
1.0
Very long
1.5
13. Runoff coefficient is denoted by _______
a) P
b) N
c) K
d) H
c
R = KP
K = R/P [K = is a runoff Coefficient depending on the surface of the catchment area].
14.  _________ is a graph showing variations of discharge with time.
a) Rising limb graph
b) Crest graph
c) Hydraulic graph
d) Gauge graph
c
15. Calculate the torque which a shaft of 300 mm diameter can safely transmit, if the shear stress is 48 N / mm2.
a) 356 kNm
b) 254 kNm
c) 332 kNm
d) 564 kNm
b
Maximum shear stress fs = 48 N/mm2.
Torque = T = π/16 fs D3
                     = 254469004.9 Nmm
                     = 254 kNm.
