1. A simple support offers only _______ reaction normal to the axis of the beam.
a) Horizontal
b) Vertical
c) Inclined
d) Moment
b
2. To avoid _____ stresses in beams, one end of the beam is placed on the rollers.
a) Compressive
b) Pyro
c) Temperature
d) Tensile
c
3. ________ support develops support moment.
a) Hinged
b) Simple
c) Fixed
d) Joint
c
4. Hinge support is called as __________
a) Socket joint
b) Swivel joint
c) Ball joint
d) Pin joint
d
5. Name the support from following figure.

6. For a simply supported beam, the moment at the support is always __________
a) Maximum
b) Zero
c) Minimum
d) Cannot be determined
b
7. “Hinged support offers resistance against rotation”.
a) True
b) False
b
8. Find the reaction at simple support A?
a) 6.5 kN
b) 9 kN
c) 10 kN
d) 7.5 kN
d
Taking moment at A = 0
4 × R @ B – 10 = 0
R @ B = 2.5 kN
Reaction at A = 10 – 2.5 = 7.5kN.
9. Roller support is same as _____
a) Hinged support
b) Fixed support
c) Simply support
d) Roller support
c
10. Hinged supports offers vertical and ________ reaction.
a) Horizontal
b) Moment
c) Rotation
d) Couple
