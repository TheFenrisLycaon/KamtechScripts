6. To avoid the failure of a column by buckling ___________ limits are to be recommended.
a) Slenderness
b) Effective length
c) Kernel
d) Radius of gyration
a
7. According to IS 456- 2000, the minimum eccentricity subjected to a column is __________
a) 30mm
b) 20mm
c) 45mm
d) 50mm
b
8. Radius of gyration is denoted by _________
a) k
b) n
c) e
d) y
a
9. Find the moment of inertia of a rectangular section of 40 mm width and 80 mm depth about the base.
a) 632×104mm4
b) 682×104mm4
c) 734×104mm4
d) 568×104mm4
b
Moment of inertia of the rectangular section passing through the base is bd3/ 3.
I = bd/3
  = 40×(80)3/ 3
  = 682.66×104mm4.
