1. Calculate the horizontal water pressure acting on a dam. The total depth of water be 13m. Take specific weight of water be 10kN/m3.
a) 765 kN
b) 845 kN
c) 965 kN
d) 1175 kN
b
Where w = 10 kN/m3.        h= 13m.
P = 10×132/ 2   = 845kN.
2. Calculate the self-weight of a rectangular dam of 22m high and 8m wide. It contains water upto a height of 20m. Consider the specific weight of masonry be 25 kN/m3.
a) 3560 kN
b) 5432 kN
c) 4400 kN
d) 5680 kN
c
Self weight of masonry (W)= (22×8)×1×25
                                               = 4400kN.
3. The pressure intensity of water at free surface is ________
a) Zero
b) Maximum
c) Minimum
d) Uniform
a
4. Self weight of dam acts in ___________ direction.
a) Vertical
b) Horizontal
c) Inclined
d) Parallel
a
5. The maximum compressive stresses developed at the base of the dam should not exceed permissible ___________ stresses for masonry.

6. For no _______ to develop in the dam section the resultant should always lie within the middle third.
a) Compression
b) Tension
c) Shear
d) Buckling
b
7. Calculate the self weight of trapezoidal dam with top width 5m and bottom width 8m. The height of dam is 15 m. Consider specific weight of masonry be 25kN/m3.
a) 3456.5 kN
b) 2768.5 kN
c) 2437.5 kN
d) 3450 kN
c
The self weight of trapezoidal dam (W) =  (a+b)/2 × H × 1 × 25
W = 2437.5 kN.
