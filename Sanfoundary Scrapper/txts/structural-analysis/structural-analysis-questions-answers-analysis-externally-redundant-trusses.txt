a) 1kN
b) 3kN
c) 5.77kN
d) 2.89kN
c
Va=Vb (Due to symmetry)
Va=Vb=5kN
At joint A,
∑V=Fac sin⁡ θ=5kN
Fac=\(\frac{5}{sin60}\)=5.77kN.
3. Calculate the P value of the member AC for the given external redundant truss, considering the horizontal reaction of support B as a redundant force.
a) 1kN
b) 3kN
c) 5.77kN
d) 2.89kN
d
Va=Vb (Due to symmetry)
Va=Vb=5kN
At joint A,
∑V=Fac sin⁡θ=5kN
Fac=\(\frac{5}{sin60}\)=5.77kN
Fac cos⁡θ=Fab=5.77*cos⁡60=2.89kN.
