1. An arch is a beam except for ____
a) It does not resist inclined load
b) It does not resist transverse forces
c) It does not allow rotation at any point
d) It does not allow horizontal movement
d
2. An arch is more economical than a beam for a shorter span length.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Two hinged arches is a determinate structure.
a) True
b) False
b
4. Calculate the horizontal thrust for the two hinged parabolic arch loaded uniformly throughout with distributed load.
a) \(\frac{WL^2}{32H} \) 
b) \(\frac{WL^2}{16H} \) 
c) \(\frac{WL^2}{8H} \) 
d) \(\frac{WL^2}{2H} \) 
c
H = \(\frac{∫M.y dy}{∫y^2  dy}\) 
Where, y=\(\frac{4 H x ( L-x )}{L^2}\) 
Hence, H = \(\frac{WL^2}{8H} \) 
5. Calculate the horizontal thrust for the two hinged parabolic arch loaded uniformly for the left half span of the arch with distributed load.
a) \(\frac{WL^2}{32H} \) 
b) \(\frac{WL^2}{16H} \) 
c) \(\frac{WL^2}{8H} \) 
d) \(\frac{WL^2}{2H} \) 
b
H = \(\frac{∫M.y dy}{∫y^2  dy}\) 
Where, y=\(\frac{4 H x ( L-x )}{L^2}\) 
Hence, H = \(\frac{WL^2}{16H} \) 
6. Calculate the horizontal thrust for the two hinged semicircular arch loaded uniformly throughout with distributed load.
a) \(\frac{W}{\pi}\) 
b) \(\frac{W}{\pi}\) sin2∞
c) \(\frac{4RW}{3\pi}\) 
d) \(\frac{W}{2\pi}\) 
c
H = \(\frac{∫M.y dy}{∫y^2  dy}\) 
Y = \(\sqrt{R^2- x^2} – \sqrt{R^2-(\frac{L^2}{2})} \) 
Hence, H = \(\frac{4RW}{3\pi}.\) 
7. Calculate the horizontal thrust for the two hinged semicircular arch loaded with point load at its crown.
a) \(\frac{W}{\pi}\) 
b) \(\frac{W}{\pi}\) 2∞
c) \(\frac{4RW}{3\pi}\) 
d) \(\frac{W}{2\pi}\) 
a
H = \(\frac{∫M.y dy}{∫y^2  dy}\) 
Y = \(\sqrt{R^2- x^2} – \sqrt{R^2-(\frac{L^2}{2})} \) 
Hence, H = \(\frac{W}{\pi}\) 
8. Calculate the horizontal thrust for the two hinged parabolic arch loaded with point load at its crown.
a) \(\frac{W}{\pi}\) 
b) \(\frac{W}{\pi}\)sin2∞
c) \(\frac{4RW}{3\pi}\) 
d) \(\frac{25WL}{128H}\) 
d
H = \(\frac{∫M.y dy}{∫y^2  dy}\) 
Where, y=\(\frac{4 H x (L-x)}{L^2}\) 
Hence, H =  \(\frac{25WL}{128H}.\) 
9. Calculate the horizontal thrust for the two hinged semicircular arch loaded with point load at inclination of α with horizontal axis on the left span.
a) \(\frac{W}{\pi}\) 
b) \(\frac{W}{\pi}\)sin2∞
c) \(\frac{4RW}{3\pi}\) 
d) \(\frac{25WL}{128H}\) 
b
H = \(\frac{∫M.y dy}{∫y^2  dy}\) 
Y = \(\sqrt{R^2- x^2} – \sqrt{R^2-(\frac{L}{2^2})} \) 
Hence, H = \(\frac{W}{\pi}\)sin2∞.
10. Identify the incorrect statement according to the hinged arches.
a) Three hinged arch is a statically determinate structure
b) To analyze three hinged arch, equlibrium equations are sufficient
c) For three hinged parabolic arch subjected to u.d.l over the entire span, the bending moment is constant throughout the span
d) For two hinged parabolic arch subjected to u.d.l over the entire span, the bending moment is zero throughout the span
c
