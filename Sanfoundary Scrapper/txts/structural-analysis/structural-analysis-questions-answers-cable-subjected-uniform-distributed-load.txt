1. Cable is a tension member.
a) True
b) False
a
2. The shape of the cable is a funicular polygon.
a) True
b) False
a
3. The shape of the cable, when loaded with uniformly distributed load throughout the span is _____
a) Linear always
b) Parabolic always
c) Trapezoidal always
d) Linear or parabolic depending upon the intensity of loading
b
4. The horizontal thrust produced at supports of cable when loaded with uniformly throughout the span is ____
a) \(\frac{WL^2}{32H} \) 
b) \(\frac{WL^2}{16H} \) 
c) \(\frac{WL^2}{8H} \) 
d) \(\frac{WL^2}{2H} \) 
c
∑H = 0
HA = HB = 0
∑M = 0
H = \(\frac{WL^2}{8H}. \) 
5. Minimum tension in the cable when loaded uniformly throughout the span is ____
a) \(\frac{WL^2}{32H} \) 
b) \(\frac{WL^2}{16H} \) 
c) \(\frac{WL^2}{8H} \) 
d) \(\frac{WL^2}{2H} \) 
c
∑H = 0
HA = HB = 0
∑M = 0
H = \(\frac{WL^2}{8H} \) 
Minimum tension in the cable equals to the horizontal thrust produced in the cable. Therefore, minimum tension in the cable is  \(\frac{WL^2}{8H}. \) 
6. Bending Moment at point D for the shown figure is ____
a) 0
b) \(\frac{WL^2}{8} \) 
c) \(\frac{WL^2}{2} \) 
d) \(\frac{WH^2}{2} \) 
a
7. Maximum tension in the cable when loaded uniformly throughout the span is ____
a) \(\frac{WL}{2}(\sqrt{1+\frac{L^2}{2H^2}}) \) 
b) \(\frac{WL}{2}(\sqrt{1+\frac{L^2}{4H^2}}) \) 
c) \(\frac{WL}{2}(\sqrt{1+\frac{L^2}{8H^2}}) \) 
d) \(\frac{WL}{2}(\sqrt{1+\frac{L^2}{16H^2}}) \) 
d
Maximum Vertical Load – V = \(\frac{WL}{2} \) 
Maximum Horizontal Load – H = \(\frac{WL^2}{8H} \) 
Therefore, Maximum Tension is \(\frac{WL}{2}(\sqrt{1+\frac{L^2}{16H^2}}) \)
8. Equilibrium equations used to analyse cable is _____
a) ∑H = 0 only
b) ∑H = 0 and ∑V = 0 only
c) ∑H = 0, ∑V = 0 and ∑M = 0
d) ∑V = 0 only
c
