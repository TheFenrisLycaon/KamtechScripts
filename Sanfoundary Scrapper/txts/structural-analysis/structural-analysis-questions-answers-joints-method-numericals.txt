1. Which of the following is not a valid assumption in analysis of truss?
a) Members are subjected to axial forces only
b) Loads and reactions will act directly or indirectly at the members only
c) Member varies linearly only
d) All joints are smooth and frictionless hinges
b
Members are subjected to axial forces only
	Loads and reactions will act directly or indirectly at the joints only
	Member varies linearly only
	All joints are smooth and frictionless hinges.
2. Self-weight of members are ignored in truss analysis.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Which of the following is not true for the method of joints?
a) Equilibrium of joints is considered in method of joints
b) Number of equilibrium equations are 2 for method of joints
c) Method of joints can be used to solve for up to 3 unknowns at a joint
d) Forces in prior member are to be calculated first, for calculating internal forces in any chosen member
c
4. Calculate the force in member BC.
a) 1KN (COMPRESSIVE)
b) 1KN (TENSILE)
c) \(\sqrt{2}\) KN (TENSILE)
d) 0KN
d
5. Find the force in member ED?
a) 1KN (COMPRESSIVE)
b) 1KN (TENSILE)
c) \(\sqrt{2}\) KN (TENSILE)
d) 0KN
a
cos45° = FED 1KN (Compressive).
6. Find the force in member BD?
a) 1KN (COMPRESSIVE)
b) 1KN (TENSILE)
c) \(\sqrt{2}\) KN (TENSILE)
d) 0KN
c
 joint D to balance the vertical force. FBDsin45° = 1KN. Thus, FBD = \(\sqrt{2}\) KN.
7. Find the force in member AF?
a) 1 KN (COMPRESSIVE)
b) 1KN (TENSILE)
c) \(\sqrt{2}\) KN (TENSILE)
d) 0KN
d
8. Calculate force in member FE.
a) 1KN (COMPRESSIVE)
b) 1KN (TENSILE)
c) 2KN (COMPRESSIVE)
d) 0KN
c

a) True
b) False
b
10. Identify incorrect statement about truss analysis.
a) Zero force may should not be removed from structure
b) Method of joint enables us to solve any kind of truss analysis problem
c) Method of section enables us to solve any kind of truss analysis problem
