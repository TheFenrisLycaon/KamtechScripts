1. Maxwell’s reciprocal theorem is applicable for elastic materials only.
a) True
b) False
a
2. Maxwell’s reciprocal theorem is applicable for only prismatic members.
a) True
b) False
b
3. Identify the incorrect statement from the following regarding applicability of Maxwell’s reciprocal theorem.
a) It is applicable for elastic member’s only
b) The temperature must remain constant throughout
c) Supports of the member should be unyielding
d) It is applicable for prismatic member only
d
4. For the given figure, if a load of 25kN placed at a position C produces a displacement of 25mm at position D. Find the displacement of position C if a load of 25kN is placed at position D.
a) 6.25mm
b) 12.5mm
c) 25mm
d) Insufficient data
d
Therefore, deflection at C due to the load of 25kN at position D is 25mm.

5. The beam shown in the figure carries loads of 20kN and 40kN at point C and D respectively and produces a deflection of 6mm at point E. To produce a deflection of 8mm and 5mm at C and D respectively, the load required at E would be ______
a) 20kN
b) 40kN
c) 50kN
d) 60kN
d
20 * 8 + 40 * 5 = W * 6
W = 60kN.
6. Betti’s Theorem is based on ______
a) Balancing of external and internal forces
b) Balancing of work done produced by external and internal loadings
c) Balancing of external and internal moments
d) Balancing of strain energy produced by external and internal loadings
b
7. The beam shown in the figure carries loads of 20kN, 30kN and 40kN at point C, D and E respectively and produces a deflection of 5mm at point F. To produce a deflection of 6mm, 8mm and 6mm at C, D, and E respectively, the load required at F would be _____
a) 30kN
b) 60kN
c) 90kN
d) 120kN
d
20 * 6 + 30 * 8 + 40 * 6 = W * 5
W = 600 / 5 = 120kN.
8. Law of reciprocal deflections was given by ______
a) E. Betti
b) James Clerk Maxwell
c) Alberto Castigliano
d) Clayperon
b
