While writing influence line equations, left most point is always considered as origin and following sign convention is followed.
1. If we require to construct ILD of vertical support at a pin joint, then according to Muller-Breslau principle, by which type of support should it be replaced?
a) Roller guide
b) Pin roller
c) Fixed support
d) Hinge
a
Following figure is for Q2-Q5.
A is a pin support, B is a hinge, C and D are roller type support.
AB = BC = 1m, CD = 2m
2. For ILD of shear at a point just left to C, what will be the equation for it on BC part of beam?
a) X
b) -X
c) 2X
d) 1
d
3. If we draw ILD of shear at appoint just right to point C, then what will be its slope at BC part of beam?
a) 0.5
b) -.5
c) 1
d) -1
b
4. If we draw ILD for shear at a point E (lying in between points C & D), then at how many points would his curve attain its peak?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
5. What will be the lowest point of ILD curve for moment at  a point just left to point C?
a) -1
b) -2
c) -3
d) -4
b
Point A is fixed support, B and D are hinges and C and E are pin roller supports.
AB = BC = CD = DE=1m
 
6. What will be the equation for ILD of vertical reaction at point A for AB part of beam?
a) 1X
b) 2X
c) 1
d) 2
c
7. What will be the maximum point of ILD of vertical reaction at point C?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
8. What will be the area under the ILD curve if we make it for the vertical reaction at a point just left to point C?
a) 1
b) 1.5
c) 2
d) 2.5
b
9. What will be the area under the ILD curve if we make it for the vertical reaction at a point just right to point C?
a) 1
b) 1.5
c) 2
d) 4
b
