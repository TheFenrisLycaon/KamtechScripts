1. Method of the section for determinate truss analysis is time effective.
a) True
b) False
a
2. To find the forces in the vertical member, preferable equilibrium equations are __________
a) ∑H = 0 & ∑M =0
b) ∑H = 0 & ∑V = 0
c) ∑H = 0, ∑V = 0 & ∑M = 0
d) ∑V = 0 & ∑M = 0
d
3. What is the force in member CG?
a) 0
b) W
c) W/2
d) W/√2
d
W/2 = FCG SIN 45°
FCG = W/√2.
4. What is the force in member CD?
a) 0
b) W (Compressive)
c) W (Tensile)
d) W/2 (Compressive)
b
FCD X L + (W/2) X 2L = 0
FCD = W (Compressive).

5. What is the force in member FG?
a) 0
b) W/2 (Tension)
c) W/2 (Compression)
d) W (Compressive)
b
	FFG X L + (W/2) X L  = 0
FFG = W/2.
6. What is the force in member EH?
a) 0
b) W ( Compressive)
c) W ( Tension )
d) W/2 (Compressive)
a
FHE X L = 0
FHE = 0.
7. Find the Force in member DG.
a) W (Tensile)
b) W (Compressive)
c) 0
d) W/2 (Compressive)
b
W + FDG = 0
FDG = W (Compressive).
8. Method of the section can always be used to calculate the force in any members.
a) True
b) False
b
9. Methods of Section can be used to evaluate which of the following truss?
a) 
b) 
c) 
d)
