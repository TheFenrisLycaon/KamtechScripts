Stiffness for OA is \(\frac{EI}{L} \) 
Stiffness for OB is 0
Stiffness for OC is \(\frac{4EI}{L} \) 
Stiffness for OD is \(\frac{3EI}{L} \) 
Therefore stiffness for joint O is the sum of the stiffness for all the members connected to it.

d
Stiffness for OA is \(\frac{EI}{L} \) 
Stiffness for OB is \(\frac{3EI}{L} \) 
Stiffness for OC is \(\frac{4EI}{L} \) 
Therefore stiffness for joint O is the sum of the stiffness for all the members connected to it.
Stiffness for the joint O is \(\frac{EI}{L}+0+\frac{4EI}{L}+\frac{3EI}{L}=\frac{8EI}{L} \)
11. Rotational stiffness at joint O for the shown the figure is _____
