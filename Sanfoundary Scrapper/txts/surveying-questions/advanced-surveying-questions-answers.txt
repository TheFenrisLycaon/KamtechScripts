1. Which of the following can describe the main purpose of the satellite station?
a) Act as false station
b) Act as true station
c) Measuring length
d) Measuring diameter
a
2. The recordings taken from eccentric station are more precise.
a) False
b) True
b
3. Which of the following indicates the formula of phase correction?
a) β = 206265 + d * sin (γ) / a
b) β = 206265 * d – sin (γ) / a
c) β = 20265 * d * sin (γ) / a
d) β = 206265 * d * sin (γ) / a
d
4. Which of the following method can be adopted if there is any object in the point of instrument station?
a) Centric station
b) True station
c) Satellite station
d) Controlled station
c
5. Find the true angle from the given figure.
a) α = θ + β1 – β2
b) α = θ + β1 + β2
c) α = θ – β1 – β2
d) α = θ * β1 – β2
a
α = θ + β1 – β2.
6. Determine the true angle, if the station is placed at the second point having angles θ, α and β as 20˚45ꞌ, 2˚31ꞌ and 7˚12ꞌ.
a) 52˚26ꞌ
b) 25˚62ꞌ
c) 25˚26ꞌ
d) 26˚25ꞌ
c
Angle = θ – α + β. On substitution, we get
Angle = 20˚45ꞌ – 2˚31ꞌ + 7˚12ꞌ
True angle = 25˚26ꞌ.
7. Determine the eccentric station point if the station is 1.65m to the west and the distance between remaining two station points is given as 300m, with an angle of 10˚12ꞌ.
a) 200˚35ꞌ
b) 2˚53ꞌ
c) 202˚53ꞌ
d) 200˚53ꞌ
d
β = 206265*d*sin (γ) / a. On substitution, we get
β = 206265*1.65*sin (10˚12ꞌ) / 300
β = 200˚53ꞌ.
8. Determine the corrected direction of the eccentric station if the value of D is given as 200m with a reflection of 9˚15ꞌ having a distance of 1.2m from the main station.
a) 198˚45ꞌ
b) 198˚56ꞌ
c) 189˚56ꞌ
d) 918˚56ꞌ
b
β = d*sin θ*206265 / D. On substitution, we get
β = 1.2*sin 9˚15ꞌ*206265 / 200
β = 198˚56ꞌ.
9. Calculate the corrected angle if the values of θ, β1  and β2 are given as 50˚46ꞌ, 12˚24ꞌ and 13˚36ꞌ.
a) 94˚34ꞌ
b) 49˚43ꞌ
c) 4˚34ꞌ
d) 49˚34ꞌ
d
Corrected angle = θ + β1 – β2. On substitution, we get
Corrected angle = 50˚46ꞌ + 12˚24ꞌ – 13˚36ꞌ
Corrected angle = 49˚34ꞌ.
10. Satellite station is also known as__________
a) Centric station
b) True station
c) Eccentric station
d) Instrument station
c
