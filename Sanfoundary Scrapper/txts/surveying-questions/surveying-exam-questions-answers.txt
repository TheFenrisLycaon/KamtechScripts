1. In pseudo ranging, travel time is measured by ___________
a) PRN code
b) Noise code
c) SPS
d) GPS
a
2. Satellite to user range can be calculated by using which of the following methods?
a) Relative positioning
b) Absolute positioning
c) Carrier wave
d) Pseudo ranging
d
3. For obtaining relative time of transmission and reception of signals, it is required to calculate clock offset.
a) False
b) True
b
4. GPS can also be known as __________
a) GOS
b) Arc GIS
c) GIS
d) NavStar
d
5. Determine the distance between satellite and user if the time difference can be calculated as 3 min.
a) 54*1019 m
b) 45*102 m
c) 54*109 m
d) 45*109 m
c
Distance = speed of light * time difference
Distance = 3*108*(3*60) m
Distance = 54 * 109 m.
