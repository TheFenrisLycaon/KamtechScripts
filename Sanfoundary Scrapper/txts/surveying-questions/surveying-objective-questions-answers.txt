1. Difference in parallax can be obtained due to___________
a) Distance between zenith
b) Distance between bearing
c) Distance between azimuth
d) Distance between points sights
d
2. Which of the following can be used to view stereo pair?
a) Aerial camera
b) Stereoscope
c) Stereoscopic camera
d) Telescope
b
3. Which of the following doesn’t come under the category of depth perception?
a) Accommodation
b) Head parallax
c) Divergence
d) Retinal display
c
4. Which of the following indicates the correct set of stereoscope classifications?
a) Lens and azimuth stereoscope
b) Mirror and azimuth stereoscope
c) Mirror and lens stereoscope
d) Mirror stereoscope and stereo pair
c
5. Which of the following indicate parallax equation for ground co-ordinate point?
a) X = B*x + p
b) X = B*x – p
c) X = B*x * p
d) X = B*x / p
d
6. The distance between nodal point and plane of photograph depends on datum height.
a) False
b) True
a
7. Displacement due to successive exposures can be given as _____________
a) Visual parallax
b) Multiple exposure
c) Exposure
d) Parallax
d
8. The value of overlapping parallax can be determined by ___________
a) P = x / xꞌ
b) P = x – xꞌ
c) P = x * xꞌ
d) P = x + xꞌ
b
9. Determine the value of parallax, if the x-coordinate on left hand photograph is 54 and on right hand photograph is 32.
a) 24
b) 12
c) 22
d) 27
c
P = x – xꞌ. On substitution, we get
P = 54 – 32
P = 22.
10. Which of the following doesn’t serve as a condition for an aerial stereoscopic view?
a) Excessive overlapping
b) Elevation of camera for exposure
c) Vertical camera axis
d) Sufficient overlapping
a
