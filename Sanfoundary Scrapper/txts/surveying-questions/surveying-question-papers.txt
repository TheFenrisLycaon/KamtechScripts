1. Most probable value can be found by using a ______________
a) Normal equation
b) Probability law
c) Probability curve
d) Algebraic coefficients
a
2. Most probable value is not used in the determination of which of the following?
a) Observations by conditions
b) Indirect readings from unequal weights
c) Observations from equal weights
d) Probability curve
d
3. If A = 57028ꞌ42ꞌꞌ, 4A = 88015ꞌ59ꞌꞌ, 5A = 143057ꞌ31ꞌꞌ. Find the most probable value of A.
a) A = 26045ꞌ46ꞌꞌ
b) A = 26054ꞌ64ꞌꞌ
c) A = 26054ꞌ46ꞌꞌ
d) A = 62054ꞌ46ꞌꞌ
c
4. The Most probable value found by normal equation involves the usage of known values.
a) True
b) False
b
5. It is necessary for the observed equations to be accompanied with condition equation.
a) True
b) False
b
6. Most probable value determines certain observations. Which among them will give accurate value?
a) Direct observation with unequal weights
b) Indirect observation with weights
c) Direct observation with weights
d) Observation with condition equation
d
7. Find the most probable value with the observations 2.76, 4.32, 9.87, 8.83 having equal weights.
a) 6.45
b) 6.54
c) 4.65
d) 5.46
a
M = (V1 + V2 + V3 +V4) / n. On substitution, we get
M = (2.76 + 4.32 + 9.87 + 8.83) / 4
M = 6.45.
8. From which of the following cases, the value of most probable value can be easily determined?
a) Indirect method
b) Direct method
c) Method of correlates
d) From observations
c
9. Determine the most probable value of B from the equations B = 65˚21ꞌ40ꞌꞌ weighing 3 and 2B = 132˚40ꞌ20ꞌꞌ weighing 2.
a) 141˚18ꞌ52.7ꞌꞌ
b) 114˚18ꞌ52.7ꞌꞌ
c) 114˚8ꞌ52.7ꞌꞌ
d) 411˚18ꞌ52.7ꞌꞌ
b
3*B = 196˚5ꞌ and similarly 8B = 1061˚22ꞌ40ꞌꞌ. On addition, we get
11B = 1257˚27ꞌ40ꞌꞌ
B = 114˚18ꞌ52.7ꞌꞌ.
10. From the set of observations (1.87+ 9.73+ 9.22), find the most probable value. The weights of the observations are given as 4, 7, 9 respectively.
a) 2.97
b) 9.72
c) 7.92
d) 7.29
c
M = (V1 + V2 + V3) / (w1 + w2 + w3). On substitution, we get
M = (4*1.87 + 7 * 9.73 + 9*9.22) / (4 + 7 + 9)
M = 7.92.
