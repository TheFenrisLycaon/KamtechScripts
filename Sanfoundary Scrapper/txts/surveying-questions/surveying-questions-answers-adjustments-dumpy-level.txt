1. Which principle is used in the process of permanent adjustment of dumpy level?
a) Repetition
b) Reiteration
c) Recurring
d) Reversion
d
2. Which of the following does not indicate a principle line?
a) Line of sight
b) Vertical axis
c) Horizontal axis
d) Axis of level tube
c
3. Which of the following does not represent the condition of adjustment?
a) Adjustment of vertical axis
b) Adjustment of level tube
c) Adjustment of cross hair ring
d) Adjustment of line of sight
a
4. The principle of single reversion is involved in which of the following processes?
a) Adjustment of vertical axis

6. Which adjustment doesn’t need any levelling?
a) Vertical axis
b) Horizontal axis
c) Line of sight
d) Cross-hair
d
7. The adjustment of line of collimation is having most priority in permanent adjustments.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Dumpy level is used for_________
a) Finding point to point distance
b) Finding the elevation difference
c) Finding the traverse area
d) Finding the perimeter of area
b
9. Permanent adjustments are done at every time the instrument is setup.
a) True
b) False
b
10. Determine the inclination of line of sight if H = 2.654 m and Hꞌ = 1.876 m and the distance between the points can be given as 150 m.
a) 0019ꞌ
b) 0020ꞌ
c) 0017ꞌ
d) 007ꞌ
c
Tan α = (H-Hꞌ) / AB. On substitution, we get
α = tan-1(2.654-1.876 / 150)
α = 0017ꞌ.
11. Find the amount of inclination provided in case of two stations A and B having staff readings 0.984m, 0.765m which are placed at a distance of 100m.
a) 1.23 m
b) 0.98 m
c) 0.44 m
d) 0.22 m
d
12. Which among the following indicates the objective of adjusting level tube?
a) Making horizontal axis truly horizontal
b) Levelling the tube
c) Making vertical axis truly vertical
d) Making line of collimation perpendicular to vertical axis
c
13. The readings of staff at points A and B are given as 1.672 m, 2.484 m and 1.928 m, 3.124 m. Find the true elevation difference between the station points.
a) 0.384 m
b) 0.834 m
c) 0.438 m
d) 0.843 m
a
The true difference in elevation can be given as 1.196 – 0.812 = 0.384 m.
