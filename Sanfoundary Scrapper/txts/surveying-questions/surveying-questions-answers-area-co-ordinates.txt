d) D.M.D method
a
3. Which of the following is the main thing in the process of calculation of area by co-ordinate method?
a) M.D
b) Departure
c) Latitude
d) Parallels
c
4. Which of the following shapes are generally considered when the area is computed by map measurements?
a) Square
b) Triangle
c) Rectangle
d) Pyramidal
b
5. The figure indicates which of the following processes?
a) Sub-division into squares
b) Sub-division into area figures
c) Division into trapezoidal figures
d) D.M.D method
a
6. Which of the following is not a classification in area by map measurement?

d
7. If the values of latitudes are 223.5 m and 65.31 m and meridians are 16.8 m, 24.67m. Find the area using D.M.D method.
a) 2268.99 sq. m
b) 2862.99 sq. m
c) 2682.99 sq. m
d) 28865.99 sq. m
c
A = 1⁄2 (223.5*16.8 + 65.31*24.67)
A = 2682.99 sq. m.
8. Find the area by co-ordinate method if the independent co-ordinates are (400, 400), (423, 456), (478, 498), (400, 400)
a) 1510 cu. m
b) 1150 cu. m
c) 5110 cu. m
d) 115 cu. m
a
A = 1⁄2 (y1(x2-x4) + y3(x3-x4) + y3(x4-x2) + y4(x1-x3)). On substitution of the co-ordinates in the area we get,
A = 1⁄2 (100(423-400) + 498(478-400) + 498(400-423) + 400(400-478))
A = -1510 cu. m, negative sign has no significance. So, A = 1510cu. M.
9. The value of total latitudes and its adjoining departures were given. Calculate area by departure and total latitudes method. Total Latitudes = 110, 25,0, 0 and adjoining departures = 245, 245, -245, -245.
a) 15636 sq. m
b) 16536 sq. m
c) 16563 sq. m
d) 15663 sq. m
b
A = 1⁄2 ∑(total latitude * algebraic sum of adjoining departures). On substituting the given values, we get,
A = 1⁄2 (110*245 + 25*245 + 0*-245 + 0*-245) = 16536 sq. m.
10. Calculate the area by M.D method, if the value of m1, m2, m3 are given as 233.4 m, 12.78 m, 99.98 m respectively and latitudes are 110 m, -15 m, 89 m.
a) 43372.51 sq. m
b) 34732.15 sq. m
c) 34537.15 sq. m
d) 34372.51 sq. m
d
A = ∑ (m*L). On substitution, we get
A = 233.4*110 + 12.78*-15 + 99.98*89
A = 34372.51 sq. m.
