1. Which of the following doesn’t belong to the set of corrections applied in astronomical corrections?
a) Correction of parallax
b) Correction of sag
c) Correction of refraction
d) Correction of semi-diameter
b
2. Magnitude of refraction depends upon which of the following factors?
a) Density
b) Surface tension
c) Reflection
d) Polarisation
a
3. Correction to the dip is always_____________
a) Zero
b) Multiplicative
c) Subtractive
d) Additive
c
4. Determine the index error for face right, if the face left and face right readings were given as 18˚24ꞌ52ꞌꞌ and 18˚23ꞌ24ꞌꞌ.
a) +24ꞌꞌ
b) +49ꞌꞌ
c) +4ꞌꞌ
d) +44ꞌꞌ
d
Index error for face right can be given as 18˚24ꞌ8ꞌꞌ – 18˚23ꞌ24ꞌꞌ = +44ꞌꞌ.
5. Find the altitude correction for semi-diameter which is having index error 25˚46ꞌ21ꞌꞌ and semi-diameter 0˚26ꞌ21ꞌꞌ.
a) 26˚12ꞌ42ꞌꞌ
b) 62˚12ꞌ42ꞌꞌ
c) 26˚21ꞌ42ꞌꞌ
d) 26˚12ꞌ24ꞌꞌ
a
25˚46ꞌ21ꞌꞌ + 0˚26ꞌ21ꞌꞌ = 26˚12ꞌ42ꞌꞌ.
6. Determine the correction for refraction if the angle of azimuth is given as 62˚21ꞌ24ꞌꞌ.
a) 10˚11ꞌ50.74ꞌꞌ
b) 0˚1ꞌ50.74ꞌꞌ
c) 0˚1ꞌ0.74ꞌꞌ
d) 50˚1ꞌ50.74ꞌꞌ
b
58ꞌꞌ*tan (62˚21ꞌ24ꞌꞌ) = 0˚1ꞌ50.74ꞌꞌ.
7. Determine the correction for parallax which has to be applied to 29˚42ꞌ31ꞌꞌ for obtaining altitude of the sun, which is given as 32˚41ꞌ15ꞌꞌ.
a) 53˚51ꞌ
b) 53˚15ꞌ
c) 35˚51ꞌ
d) 5˚51ꞌ
a
Correction for parallax = horizontal parallax * cos apparent latitude
Correction for parallax = 8*8cos α. On substitution, we get
Correction for parallax = 53˚51ꞌ, this has to applied for 29˚42ꞌ31ꞌꞌ in order to have the correct altitude of the sun.
8. Determine the corrected azimuth value if the azimuth is given as 54˚32ꞌ15ꞌꞌhaving b = +23ꞌꞌ with vertical angle 29˚42ꞌ31ꞌꞌ.
a) 67˚39ꞌ40ꞌꞌ
b) 67˚30ꞌ39.78ꞌꞌ
c) 67˚39ꞌ39.78ꞌꞌ
d) 76˚39ꞌ39.78ꞌꞌ
c
Correction = b*tan α = 23*tan 29˚42ꞌ31ꞌꞌ = 13˚7ꞌ24.8ꞌꞌ. On summation,
Corrected azimuth = 54˚32ꞌ15ꞌꞌ + 13˚7ꞌ24.8ꞌꞌ
Corrected azimuth = 67˚39ꞌ39.78ꞌꞌ.
9. Which of the following is always subtractive?
a) Correction for reflection
b) Correction for dip
c) Correction for parallax
d) Correction for polarization
b
10. Apply correction for dip angle if the height of the observer at the sea level is given as 54m.
a) 23˚13ꞌ45.05ꞌꞌ
b) 0˚3ꞌ45.05ꞌꞌ
c) 0˚31ꞌ45.05ꞌꞌ
d) 0˚13ꞌ45.05ꞌꞌ
d
Tan β = \(\sqrt{2h/R}\). Where, R is the radius of earth.
Tan β = \(\sqrt{2*54/(6370*1000)}\) 
β = 0˚13ꞌ45.05ꞌꞌ.
