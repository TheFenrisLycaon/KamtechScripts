1. Which among the following is used in the formation of the astronomical triangle?
a) Zenith
b) Meridian
c) Horizon
d) Azimuth
a
2. When the greatest distance is to the east of the meridian then the elongation is said to be____________
a) Azimuthal elongation
b) Meridian elongation
c) Western elongation
d) Eastern elongation
d
3. Which of the following cases determine that the astronomical triangle is right angled?
a) Star at horizon
b) Star at prime vertical
c) Star at culmination
d) Star at elongation
b
4. Napier’s rule is used for the calculation of___________
a) Latitude
b) Declination
c) Hour angle
d) Horizon
c
5. If the star is at horizon which of the following will be equal to zero?
a) Prime vertical
b) Altitude
c) Declination of circle
d) Meridian
b
6. A star crosses a meridian only once in its revolution.
a) False
b) True
a
7. Which of the following is obtained from astronomical triangle?
a) Relation between cylindrical co-ordinates
b) Relation between rectangular co-ordinates
c) Relation between geometrical co-ordinates
d) Relation between spherical co-ordinates
d
8. Which of the following cases is not related to astronomical triangle?
a) Star at culmination
b) Star at elongation
c) Star at vertical
d) Star at prime vertical
c
9. The stars which always move above the horizon are called as__________
a) Circumpolar star
b) Prime star
c) Horizon star
d) Culmination star
a
10. The culmination of the star depends upon which of the following factors?
a) Zenith
b) Altitude
c) Meridian
d) Horizon
b
11. If the star is at elongation, find the altitude of the celestial body having declination and latitude as 24˚56ꞌ and 21˚43ꞌ.
a) 16˚16ꞌ
b) 61˚61ꞌ
c) 16˚16ꞌ
d) 61˚16ꞌ
d
Sin α = sin θ * cosec δ. Where θ = latitude of the observer and δ = declination of the celestial body. On substitution, we get
Sin α = sin 21˚43ꞌ * cosec 24˚56ꞌ
Sin α = 0.87
α = 61˚16ꞌ.
12. The point in the figure indicates which among the following?
a) Circumpolar star
b) Circum centre star
c) Polar star
d) Circum star
a
