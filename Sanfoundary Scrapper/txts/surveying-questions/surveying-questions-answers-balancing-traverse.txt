d

d) Spherical co-ordinates
c
10. Among the following, the most commonly used method of balancing a traverse is_________

b) Transit method
c) Axis method
d) Bowditch’s method
d
11. Calculate the correction for departure of BC, using Bowditch’s rule.
Line
Length (m)
Consecutive co-ordinates 
Latitude
Departure
AB
 121.87
+225.87
-228.92
BC 
199.85
-268.25
+326.62
CA
245.57
+43.31
-98.69
a) 362.969
b) 326.969
c) 326.696
d) 323.969
b
Perimeter of traverse = 114.99 + 217.57 + 319.31 = 567.29 m
Correction for departure of AB = length of AB * total error in departure / perimeter of traverse = 199.85 * -0.99 / 567.29 = -0.349 m. Error is negative then correction is positive i.e., correction = 326.62 + 0.349 = 326.969.
12. Using transit method, calculate the correction for latitude of BC.
Line
Length (m)
Consecutive co-ordinates 
Latitude
Departure
AB
 125.91
-264.97
+50.65
BC 
198.57
+182.96
-104.62
CA
229.88
+79.62
+59.77
a) 184.78
b) 183.789
c) 185.879
d) 183.987
b
Total perimeter of traverse = 125.91 + 198.57 + 229.88 = 554.36 m
Sum of latitudes = 264.97 + 182.96 + 79.62 = 527.55
Now, correction for latitude of BC = latitude of BC * total error in departure / sum of latitudes = 182.96 * (- 2.39) / 527.55 = – 0.829 m. If error is negative, correction is positive
Corrected departure = 182.96 + 0.829 = 183.789.
