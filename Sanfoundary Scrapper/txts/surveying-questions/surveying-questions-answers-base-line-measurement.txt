b) Flexible apparatus
c) Rigid bars
d) Jaderin’s apparatus
c
7. Which of the following indicates a flexible apparatus?
a) Copper tape
b) Steel tape
c) Chain
d) Iron tape
b
8. Which of the following methods is having more amount of flexibility?
a) Flexible apparatus
b) Rigid bars
c) Colby apparatus
d) Jaderin’s method
d
9. The formula for correction for temperature is ___________
a) C = α (Tm – T0) L
b) C = α (Tm – T0) + L
c) C = α (Tm + T0) L
d) C = α (Tm – T0) / L
a
10. What will be the correction for absolute length of the length of the line is 20m, correction is 2m and length of the tape is 30m?
a) 1.43
b) 1.34
c) 31.42
d) 2.65
b
Ca = L*c / l. On substitution, we get
Ca = 20*2 / 30
Ca = 1.34.
11. Determine the correction for the temperature, if the mean temperature is 30˚C and the temperature during standardization of tape is about 28˚C with length of the line 9m.
a) 8*10-6
b) 81*10-6
c) 18*10-6
d) 18*106
c
Ct = α*(Tm – T0)*L. here, α = 1*10-6˚C. On substitution, we get
Ct = 1*10-6*(30-28)*9
Ct = 18*10-6.
12. Apply correction for tension, if the pull applied during measurement is 15N and standard pull is about 8N. Measured length is about 10m, cross-section of the tape is 5 sq. cm with E 2*107 N/sq. cm.
a) 7*107
b) 6*107
c) 7*1010
d) 7*102
a
Cp = (P-Po)*L / A*E. On substitution, we get
Cp = (15-8)*10 / (5*2*107)
Cp = 7*107.
13. If the weight of the tape is 1kg having length 100m with 6 equal bays. The pull applied will be 9N, calculate the correction for sag.
a) 0.01042
b) 0.0142
c) 0.142
d) 0.00142
d
Cs = l*W2 / (24*n2*p2). On substitution, we get
Cs = 100*1 / (24*62*92)
Cs = 0.00142.
14. Calculate the correction for misalignment, if the length of the line is 18m with perpendicular of 3m.
a) 0.52
b) 0.25
c) 2.05
d) 5.02
b
Ch = d2 / 2*L. On substitution, we get
Ch = 32 / 2*18
Ch = 0.25.
15. What will be the correction for slope, if the length of the line is given as 20m with slope of 5˚46ꞌ?
a) 1.101
b) 0.011
c) 0.101
d) 1.001
c
Cv = 2*L*sin2(θ/2). On substitution, we get
Cv = 2*20*(5˚46ꞌ/2)
Cv = 0.101.
