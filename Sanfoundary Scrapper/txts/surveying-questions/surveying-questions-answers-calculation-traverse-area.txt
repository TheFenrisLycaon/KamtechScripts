c
9. Which of the following methods will give the accurate result while traversing?
a) Loose needle method
b) Fast needle method
c) Chain traversing
d) Compass traversing
b
10. Among the following, which indicates the formula for balancing angles of closed traverse?
a) ∑ Interior angles = (n+2) * 1800
b) ∑ Interior angles = (n-2) / 1800
c) ∑ Exterior angles = (n-2) * 1800
d) ∑ Interior angles = (n-2) * 1800
d
∑ Interior angles = (n-2) * 1800
Where, n = number of interior angles.
By using this, the error in the interior angles can be checked and can be minimised.
11. Calculate the area of traverse for the figure, if lengths of AB, BC, CD, and DA are 12.98 m, 98.23 m, 19.77 m, 34.67 m and the angles α, β given as ____________
a) 1086.55sq. m
b) 698.41sq. m
c) 1068.91 sq. m
d) 689.14 sq. m
a
Area of triangle ABD = (1 / 2) * (ad)* sin α = (1 / 2) * (12.98*34.67) * sin () = 194.07 sq. m
Area of triangle BCD = (1 / 2) * (bc) * sin β = (1 / 2) * (98.23*19.77) * sin () = 892.48 sq. m
The total are can be given as 194.07 + 892.48 = 1086.55 sq. m.
12. What will be the value of DMD for B if DMD for A is -22.87, departures for A & B will be -22.87, +89.24 respectively?
a) 22.8
b) 43.5
c) -43.5
d) -22.8
b
DMD of A + Departure of A + Departure of B
= -22.87 – 22.87 + 89.24 = +43.5.
13. Calculate the value of double area if the value of latitude of A is 235.67 m and DMD is +89.26 m.
a) 20135 sq. m
b) 21305 sq. m
c) 21035 sq. m
d) 20035 sq. m
c
Latitude * DMD = 235.67 * 89.26 = 21035 sq. m.
