a) Levelling
b) Centering
c) Contouring
d) Balancing
d
4. If the observed back sight and fore sight are x1 and x2. The correction back sight on A will be equal to x1-y1, where y1= D1 tan i°. The correct fore sight on B will be equal to x2-y2 where, y2 = D2 tan i°. Then what is the correction difference in level between A and B.
a) x1 – x2
b) x2 – x1
c) x1 – x2 + (D2 tan i° – D1 tan i°)
d) x2 – x1 + (D1tan i° + D2 tan i°)
c
5. If the observed back sight and fore sight are x1 and x2. The correction back sight on A will be equal to x1-y1, where y1= D1 tan i°. The correct fore sight on B will be equal to x2-y2 where, y2 = D2 tan i°. Then what is the correction difference in level between A and B, if D1 = D2?
a) x1 – x2
b) x2 + x1
c) x1 – x2 + (D2 tan i° – D1 tan i°)
d) x2 – x1 + (D1tan i° + D2 tan i°)
a
6. If the observed back sight and fore sight are 20 m and 18 m. The correction back sight on A will be equal to 16 m, The correct fore sight on B will be equal to 14 m where then what is the correction difference in level between A and B?
a) 4 m
b) 3 m
c) 2 m
d) 6 m
c
7. If the staff reading at point A = ha and at a point B = hb. The correct staff reading should have been Ha and Hb, then the correction difference in elevation between A and B is given by _____
a) ha – hb
b) ha + hb
c) Ha – Hb
d) Ha + Hb
c
8. If the staff reading at point A = ha and at a point B = hb. The correct staff reading should have been Ha and Hb, where Ha = ha – ha’ and Hb = hb – hb’ then the correction difference in elevation between A and B is given by ____________
a) ha – hb – ha’ + hb’
b) ha + hb + ha’ + hb’
c) Ha – Hb + ha’ – hb’
d) Ha + Hb
a
Ha – Hb = (ha – ha’) – (hb – hb’) = ha – hb – ha’ + hb’.

a) True
b) False
b

a) intermediate point
b) level point
c) change point
d) end point
c
