6. Which of the following corresponds to the correction applied to the bearing of the last side?
a) Correction = Ne/N
b) Correction = 2Ne/N
c) Correction = 3Ne/N
d) Correction = e/N
a
Correction to the first bearing = e/N
Correction to the first bearing = 2e/N
And so on to the last bearing = Ne/N = e.
7. If traversing is done by taking bearings of the lines, the closing error in bearing may be determined by _______________
a) Comparing the back and fore bearings of the last line of the open traverse
b) Comparing the back and fore bearings of the middle line of the closed traverse
c) Comparing the back and fore bearings of the last line of the closed traverse
d) Comparing the back and fore bearings of the first line of the closed traverse
c
8. Which of the following is a method of adjusting a closed traverse?
a) Departure method
b) Axis method
c) Tangential method
d) Latitude method
b
9. Relative error of closure is given as____________
a) Perimeter of closure/error of traverse
b) Error of perimeter/perimeter of traverse
c) Perimeter of traverse/error of traverse
d) Error of closure/perimeter of traverse
d
10. Closing error can be briefly explained in which of the following set of methods?
a) Bowditch’s, Transit methods
b) Transit, Axis methods
c) Graphical, Axis methods
d) Bowditch’s, Graphical methods
c
11. From the following observations, calculate closing error.
Line
Length (m)
Latitude
Departure
AB
92.96
+92.57
-217.92
BC 
157.63
-317.39
+24.62
CA
131.24
+226.19
+192.36
a) 1.66
b) 1.55
c) 1.44
d) 1.99
a
Where, ∑L = 92.57 – 317.39 + 226.19 = 1.37
∑D = -217.92 + 24.62 + 192.36 = – 0.94
On substituting, we get e =  ((∑L)2+(∑D)2)1/2
  e = (1.372+ 0.942)1/2
  e = 1.661.
12. Calculate the direction of closing error for the following data.
Line
Length (m)
Latitude
Departure
AB
24.29
-102.31
-119.22
BC 
130.32
+360.24
-204.92
CA
249.11
-257.43
+323.26
a) 50023ꞌ
b) 60029ꞌ
c) 60023ꞌ
d) 62023ꞌ

13. For a traverse containing 10 sides, what would be the correction applied for the first side, if it consists a closing error of +1.92?
a) 19.0
b) 19.2
c) 1.902
d) 0.192
d
14. What would be the correction for any side of a traverse in axis method if it has a closing error e = 0.93, length of side and axis would be 243.13 and 100 respectively?
a) 2.131
b) 1.131
c) 1.113
d) 1.311
b
Correction = 243.13 * (0.93/2) / 100 = 1.131.
15. Which of the following indicates the correct value of precise closing error if e = 0.54 and lengths of sides are 92.69 m, 119.23 m, 92.64 m, 42.96 m and 60.96 m.
a) 1 / 766.445
b) 1 / 746.445
c) 1 / 756.445
d) 1 / 765.445
c
Where e = closing error = 0.54 and p = perimeter of traverse = 92.69 + 119.23 + 92.64 + 42.96 + 60.96 = 408.48 m.
Precise error is given as 0.54 / 408.48 = 1 / 756.445.
