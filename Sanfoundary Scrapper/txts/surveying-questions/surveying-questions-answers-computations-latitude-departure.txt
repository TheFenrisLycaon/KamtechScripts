1. Departure refers to __________
a) Co-ordinate length measured at right angles
b) Co-ordinate length measured at right angles to the meridian direction
c) Co-ordinate length measured parallel to the assumed meridian direction
d) Co-ordinate length measured parallel to the datum
b
2. When measured towards southward, latitude is negative.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Departure can be given as __________
a) D = l cos θ
b) D = l tan θ
c) D = l cosec θ
d) D = l sin θ
d
4. Consecutive co-ordinates are also known as __________
a) Total co-ordinates
b) Independent co-ordinates
c) Dependent co-ordinates
d) Departure co-ordinates
c
5. Latitude and Departure equations will never return positive values.
a) False
b) True
a
Sin (0°) to Sin (90°) ranges from 0 to 1
Cos (0°) to Cos (90°) ranges from 1 to 0
The correct mathematical sign for the Latitude and Departure come from the bearing quadrant.
6. For calculating latitude and departure they must be converted into__________
a) Whole Circle Bearing system
b) Reduced Bearing system
c) True bearing system
d) Assumed bearing system
b
7. The latitude for the figure can be given as __________(θ = 500 34ꞌ)
a) 160.43m
b) 151.34m
c) 161.34m
d) 165m
c
L = l cos θ = 245* cos (500 34ꞌ) = 161.34m.
8. S-W lies in which of the following quadrant______________
a) IV
b) II
c) I
d) III
d
9. By which of the following step, Independent co-ordinate can be obtained?
a) ∑L + ∑D
b) ∑L – ∑D
c) ∑L2 + ∑D2
d) ∑L2 – ∑D2
a
10. Total co-ordinate point is referred as___________
a) Dependent co-ordinate point
b) Independent co-ordinate point
c) Consecutive co-ordinate point
d) Departure co-ordinate point
b
11. If the value of θ = 720 49ꞌ, find the value of departure for side having a length 300 m.
a) 286.17
b) 268.91
c) 286.61
d) 286.16
c
D = 300 * sin (720 49ꞌ) = 286.61 m.
12. The value of θ = 1620 49ꞌ in Reduced Bearing system can be represented as ____________
a) S1706ꞌE
b) S27026ꞌE
c) S7026ꞌE
d) S17026ꞌE
d
R.B = 1800 – W.C.B which means R.B = 1800 – 162024ꞌ = 17026ꞌ = S17026ꞌE.
In R.B system, the direction of the angle is also mentioned along with the value.
13. What will be the value of total co-ordinate of B, if it is initially assumed as 100 and N latitude at A is given as 192.96?
a) 292.96
b) 92.96
c) 229.69
d) 29.69
a
Total co-ordinate + latitude at A = 100 + 192.96 = 292.96
The total co-ordinate at B is given as 292.96.
