1. Correction for parallax is given as ___________
a) Horizontal parallax * sin of apparent altitude
b) Horizontal parallax * cot of apparent altitude
c) Horizontal parallax * tan of apparent altitude
d) Horizontal parallax * cos of apparent altitude
d
2. Express the 24˚12ꞌ42ꞌꞌ in hours, minutes and seconds.
a) 4h 36m 50.8s
b) 16h 36m 50.8s
c) 1h 36m 50.8s
d) 1h 6m 20.8s
c
24˚= 24˚/15 = 1h 36m; 12ꞌ = 12ꞌ / 15 = 0h 0m 48s; 42ꞌꞌ = 42ꞌꞌ/15 = 0h 0m 2.8s. On addition, we get
1h 36m 50.8s.
3. Determine the local time if the standard time is 19h 42m 7s and the difference in longitude can be given as 3h 9m towards west.
a) 16h 33m 7s
b) 61h 33m 7s
c) 16h 34m 5s
d) 6h 33m 7s
a
Local time = standard time ± difference in longitude. Here, longitude is towards west so we have to use negative direction.
On substitution, we get
Local time =  19h 42m 7s –  3h 9m
Local time = 16h 33m 7s.
4. Find G.M.T of a place if the L.M.T is given as 9h 24m 17s and the longitude 10h 23m 32s towards east.
a) 19h 47m 4s
b) 19h 47m 49s
c) 9h 47m 49s
d) 19h 4m 49s
b
G.M.T = L.M.T + longitude. On substitution, we get
G.M.T = 9h 24m 17s + 10h 23m 32s
G.M.T = 19h 47m 49s.
5. Which of the following indicate the standard time meridian of India?
a) 82˚3ꞌ
b) 28˚30ꞌ
c) 8˚30ꞌ
d) 82˚30ꞌ
d
6. The mean time associated with the standard meridian can be given as _________
a) Meridian time
b) Average time
c) Standard time
d) Absolute time
b
7. The formula of mean solar time can be given as ____________
a) Hour angle + 12h
b) Seconds angle + 12h
c) Minutes angle + 12h
d) Hour angle + 24h
a
8. Express the hours (19h 42m 16s) in angles.
a) 259˚34ꞌ
b) 295˚43ꞌ
c) 295˚34ꞌ
d) 25˚34ꞌ
c
So, 19h = 19*15˚ = 285˚; 42m = 42m*15ꞌ = 10˚30ꞌ; 16s = 16s*15ꞌꞌ = 0˚4ꞌ. On addition, we get
295˚34ꞌ.
9. Which of the following indicates formula for green witch mean time?
a) G.M.T = L.M.T * longitude of the place
b) G.M.T = L.M.T ± longitude of the place
c) G.M.T = L.M.T + longitude of the place
d) G.M.T = L.M.T / longitude of the place
b
G.M.T = L.M.T ± longitude of the place. The sign plus or minus depends upon the direction of the longitude, towards east plus and towards west minus.
10. Calculate mean solar time if the hour angle of the sun is 34h 21m 15s.
a) 46h 21m 15s
b) 64h 21m 15s
c) 46h 12m 15s
d) 46h 21m 51s
a
Mean solar time = hour angle of the sun + 12h. On substitution, we get
Mean solar time = 34h 21m 15s + 12h
Mean solar time = 46h 21m 15s.
