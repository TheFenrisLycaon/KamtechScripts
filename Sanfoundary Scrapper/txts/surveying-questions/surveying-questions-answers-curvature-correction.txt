1. Which of the following indicates the assumption assumed in case of curvature correction?
a) End sections are parallel
b) End sections are vertical
c) End sections are not present
d) End sections are perpendicular
a
2. Which of the following is not a case assumed in curvature correction?
a) Two level section
b) Three level section
c) Four level section
d) Side hill section
c
3. Level section requires application of correction.
a) True
b) False
b
4. For larger and smaller areas, same formula can be applied in case of side-hill section.
a) False
b) True
a
5. Correction for curvature is applied for getting ___________
a) Station points
b) Ordinates
c) Heights
d) Equivalent areas
d
6. What is the correction applied for two-level section if the area of the traverse is 121.45 sq. m and value of e = 9.34?
a) 9.34 sq. m
b) 9.06 sq. m
c) 9.46 sq. m
d) 9.43 sq. m
a
C = A*e/A, where e is the eccentricity and A is the area. On substitution, we get
C = 121.54 * 9.34 / 121.54 = 9.34 sq. m.
7. What will be the correction for curvature of three level sections, if the areas are given as 43.56 sq. m, 22.54sq.m and h = 56.43 sq. m, b= 2, n= 2 which are having faces at a unity distance having 59.87 m radius?
a) 220.91 sq. m
b) 220.19 sq. m
c) 202.65 sq. m
d) 205.65 sq.m
b
C = d*(w2 – w12)*(h + b/2n) / 6R. On substitution, we get
C = 1*(43.562 – 22.542)*(56.43 + 2/2*2) / 6*59.87
C = 220.19 sq. m.
8. Find the value of eccentricity if the values of area of the sides can be given as 134.76 sq. m, 56.76 sq. m and A = 76.65 sq. m with number of sides as 2.
a) 3185.23 sq. m
b) 3158.32 sq. m
c) 3185.32 sq. m
d) 3185.99 sq. m
c
e = w1*w2*(w1+w2) / 3*A*n. on substitution, we get
e = 134.76*56.76*(134.76 + 56.76)/3*76.65*2
e = 3185.32 sq. m.
9. Find the correction for side hill of two level section if the area is given as 654.76 sq. m, and the value of eccentricity is 89.76.
a) 89.76 sq. m
b) 98.76 sq. m
c) 89.67 sq. m
d) 98.54 sq. m
a
C = A*e / A. On substitution, we get
C = 654.76*89.76 / 654.76
C = 89.76 sq. m.
10. Find the value of e for side hill of small area by using the values provided. W = 54.32 sq. m, b = 1, n = 2, h = 76.24 sq. m.
a) 43.87
b) 87.98
c) 96.1
d) 69.1
d
e = (w1 + b/2 + n*h) / 3. On substitution, we get
e = 69.1.
