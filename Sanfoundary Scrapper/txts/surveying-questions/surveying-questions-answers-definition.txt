b) Representation factor
c) Reciprocating factor
d) Recurring factor
a
14. Which among the following scales is used to determine the original scale when the plan on the drawing sheet shrinks due to atmospheric conditions?
a) Vernier scale
b) Plane scale
c) Shrunk scale
d) Diagonal scale
c
15. Which among the following methods is used for determining the precise position on the earth surface?

b) Geodic surveying
c) Land surveying
d) Plane Surveying
b
16. Which among the following is one of the principles of surveying?

17. Design a vernier for a theodolite circle divided into degrees and one fourth degrees to read to 20ꞌꞌ.
a) 55
b) 45
c) 65
d) 35
b
               S = (1/4)˚= 15ꞌ   and   L.C=20ꞌꞌ=20/60 min.
               So, 20/60 = 15/n
                n = 45.
