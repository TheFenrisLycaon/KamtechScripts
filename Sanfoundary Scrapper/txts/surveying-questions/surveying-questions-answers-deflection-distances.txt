1. The method of deflection distances is used in which of the following cases?
a) Road surveys
b) Railway survey
c) Land survey
d) Town planning survey
a
2. The method of producing offsets from the chords can also be named as ____________
a) Rankine’s method
b) Bisection of chords
c) Deflection distances
d) Two-theodolite method
c
3. Which of the following indicates the formula used in deflection distances?
a) On = Cn  + (Cn-1 + Cn)/2*R
b) On = Cn (Cn-1 + Cn)/2+R
c) On = Cn (Cn-1 – Cn)/2*R
d) On = Cn (Cn-1 + Cn)/2*R
d
4. Which of the following process can be adopted as an alternative of theodolite?
a) Bisection of chords
b) Deflection distances
c) Ordinates by long chords
d) Rankine’s method
b
5. Errors in deflection distances method are distributed to all the points.
a) True
b) False
a
6. Closing error can also be known as __________
a) Absolute error
b) Zero error
c) Subjecting error
d) Discrepancy
d
7. While producing offsets by deflection distances method, the last offset must coincide with the beginning.
a) False
b) True
b
8. Determine the first offset if the chord length is given as 23.98m and the radius is given as 5.87m.
a) 84.98 m
b) 48.98 m
c) 48.89 m
d) 84.89 m
b
O = 23.982 / 2*5.87
O = 48.98m.
9. Find the value of last offset, if the lengths of first and second chords are given as 45.87m and 62.87m with radius of curve 69.76m and length of chain being 30m.
a) 38.987 m
b) 83.987 m
c) 38.697 m
d) 83.697 m
d
On = Cn*(Cn – 1 + Cn) / 2*R, it can be simplified as
On = cꞌ*(C + cꞌ) / 2*R. On substitution, we get
On = 62.87*(30 + 62.87) / 69.76
On = 83.697m.
10. Find the value of chord length if the offset is given as 36.54m and the radius include 3.43m.
a) 15.38 m
b) 51.83 m
c) 15.83 m
d) 87.54 m
c
O = C2 / 2*R. On substitution, we get
36.54 = C2 / 2*3.43
C = 15.83m.
