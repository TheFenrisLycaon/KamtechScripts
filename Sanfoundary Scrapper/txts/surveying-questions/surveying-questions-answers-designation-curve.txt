c
8. Length of the curve depends on the criteria used for defining the degree of the curve.
a) True
b) False
a
9. Mid-ordinate is also known as __________

a
10. The formula for tangent length can be given as __________
a) T = R + tan(Δ/2)
b) T = R * tan(Δ/2)
c) T = R / tan(Δ/2)
d) T = R – tan(Δ/2)
b
11. Find the value of mid-ordinate if the value of R can be given as 22.19m and the angle is given as 19˚21ꞌ.
a) 0.89 m
b) 0.98 m
c) 0.13 m
d) 0.31 m
d
= 22.19-22.19*cos (19˚21ꞌ/2)
= 0.31 m.
12. What would be the length of the curve, if the radius of the curve is 24.69m and the angle is given as 12˚42ꞌ?
a) 9.87 m
b) 5.74 m
c) 5.47 m
d) 9.78 m
c
l = 24.69*(π/180)*12˚42ꞌ
l = 5.47 m.
13. Find the tangent length if the radius of the curve and its angle were given as 42.64m and 42˚12ꞌ.
a) 16.45 m
b) 16.54 m
c) 61.45 m
d) 61.54 m
a
T = r*tan (θ/2). On substitution, we get
T = 42.64*tan (42˚12ꞌ/2)
T = 16.45 m.
14. What would be the value of apex distance if the angle is given as 13˚42ꞌ and the radius of the curve is given as 19.24m?
a) 0.1134 m
b) 0.831 m
c) 0.318 m
d) 0.138 m
d
E = R*(sec (θ/2)-1). On substitution, we get
E = 19.24*(sec (13˚42ꞌ/2)-1)
E = 0.138 m.
15. If the radius of the curve is given as 14.96m and the angle is about 32˚24ꞌ, find the length of the chord.
a) 8.43 m
b) 8.34 m
c) 4.83 m
d) 3.43 m
b
L = 2*14.96*sin (32˚24ꞌ/2)
L = 8.34 m.
