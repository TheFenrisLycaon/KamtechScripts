1. Which of the following has the maximum value in an electric or magnetic field?
a) Wave length
b) Focal length
c) Frequency
d) Amplitude
d
2. Velocity of light can be given as ___________
a) 1*108m/s
b) 3.9*108m/s
c) 3*108m/s
d) 3*1018m/s
c
3. In EM waves, electric field is not used.
a) False
b) True
a
4. Determine the wave length if the frequency is given as 67Hz.
a) 1.044*108m
b) 0.044*108m
c) 0.44*108m
d) 0.044*1010m
b
λ = 3*108/ 67
λ = 0.044*108m.
5. Find the value of energy if the wave length is given as 43m.
a) 0.46*10-26 J
b) 0.46*10-26 J
c) 0.46*10-26 J
d) 0.46*10-26 J
d
Q = h*c / λ. Here, h = 6.625*10-34J.s. On substitution, we get
Q = 6.625*10-34 * 3*108 / 43
Q = 0.46*10-26 J.
6. If the intensity of wave length decreases, the energy released will  ___________
a) Increase
b) Decrease
c) Remain same
d) Zero
a
7. What will be the wave length if the energy produced is 36J?
a) 0.5*10-26m
b) 0.55*10-26m
c) 0.55*10-16m
d) 0.55*10-6m
b
Q = h*c / λ. On substitution, we get
36 = 6.625*10-34 * 3*108 / λ
λ = 0.55*10-26m.
8. In an EM field, which filed is placed horizontal?
a) Gamma rays
b) Sonar field
c) Electric field
d) Magnetic field
d
9. The wave length sensed in remote sensing are __________
a) Nano meters and giga meters range
b) Nano meters and deci meters range
c) Nano meters and micro meters range
d) Nano meters and meters range
c
10. In the following figure, X represents___________
a) Length
b) Time period
c) Frequency
d) Wave length
d
