a) False
b) True
b
6. Gamma rays are having a wavelength of _________
a) Zero
b) Greater than 0.03nm
c) Less than 0.03nm
d) Equal to 0.03nm
c
7. Which of the following waves can be used in case of remote sensing?
a) UV rays
b) X-rays
c) Gamma rays
d) Visible rays
d
8. Which of the following indicates the correct set of combination in radio waves?
a) Shorter wavelength – high frequency
b) Longer wavelength – less frequency
c) Shorter wavelength – less frequency
d) Longer wavelength – high frequency
a
9. How much wave length is reflected back by the earth surface from the absorbed sun radiation?
a) 0.5meter
b) 0.5 micrometer
c) 0.5 centimeter
d) 0.5 decimeter
b
10. EM waves varies from ______ to ________
a) Meters to nano-meters
b) Meters to micro-meters
c) Nano to micro-meters
d) Centimeters to nano-meters
a
11. The formula of energy produced from the body can be given as _________
a) Q = h- c / λ
b) Q = h*c * λ
c) Q = h+ c / λ
d) Q = h*c / λ
d
Q = h*c / λ. From this, the wave length can be determined by having an energy value. This help in the determination of the wavelength by using plank’s constant.
