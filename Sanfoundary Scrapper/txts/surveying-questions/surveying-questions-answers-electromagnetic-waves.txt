1. Modern EDM uses which among the following waves?
a) Visible rays
b) Thermal infra-red
c) Modulated infra-red
d) Radio waves
c
2. Which property of an electromagnetic wave, depends on the medium in which it is travelling?
a) Velocity
b) Frequency
c) Time period
d) Wave length
a
3. The distance in EDM is measured by______________
a) Frequency of the wave
b) Wave length
c) Phase difference
d) Amplitude
c
4. Tellurometer, a type of EDM uses which of the following waves?
a) Visible rays
b) Infra-red waves
c) Micro waves
d) Radio waves
d
5. Find the value of D if the wave length of the wave is 40m, n=2 m and the angles are given as θ1 = 0˚, θ2 = 180˚.
a) 50m
b) 40m
c) 20m
d) 10m
a
2D = n*λ + Δ*λ. On substitution, we get
2D = 40*(2 + (180-0/360))
D = 50 m.
6. Electromagnetic waves are represented in which of the following format?
a) Longitudinal waves
b) Transverse waves
c) Sinusoidal waves
d) Surface waves
c
7. For increasing accuracy, high frequency of propagation is used.
a) True
b) False
a
8. What would be the value of length if the distance is given as 30m, m= 3 and the change in length is 8m.
a) 7.43m
b) 7.34m
c) 6.34m
d) 5.43m
b
D = m*l + Δ l. On substitution, we get
30 = 3*l + 8
L = 7.34 m.
9. Phase difference can be expressed in which of the following format?
a) Meters per second
b) Meters
c) Cycles
d) Seconds
c
10. Which of the following represents the correct sequence for the basis of EDM propagation?
a) Propagation, generation, reflection and reception
b) Generation, reception, reflection and propagation
c) Generation, propagation, reception and reflection
d) Generation, propagation, reflection and reception
d
