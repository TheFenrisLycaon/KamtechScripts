a) \(T = t_l – (t_s + t_l) \frac{sin⁡(Δ1)}{sin⁡Δ}\) 
b) \(T = t_l + (t_s – t_l) \frac{sin⁡(Δ1)}{sin⁡Δ}\) 
c) \(T = t_l + (t_s + t_l) \frac{sin⁡(Δ1)}{sin⁡Δ}\) 
d) \(T = t_l + (t_s + t_l) \frac{sin⁡(Δ1)}{sin⁡Δ}\) 
c
7. What would be the short curve length of tangent if the radius of curvature is given as 43.21m and deflection of about76˚54ꞌ?
a) 34.13m
b) 43.13m
c) 43.31m
d) 34.31m
d
t = R*tan (θ/2). On substitution, we get
t = 43.21*tan (76˚54ꞌ/2)
t = 34.31 m.
8. Find the value of the long curve tangent distance, if the tangent length of short and long curves were given as 23.21m and 65.87m. The total deflection is 67˚54ꞌ and the deflection angle at short curve is given as 28˚43ꞌ.
a) 112.06m
b) 121.06m
c) 211.06m
d) 121.68m
a
T = tl + (ts+tl)* sin θ1/ sin θ. On substitution, we get
T = 65.87 + (23.21+65.87)* sin 28˚43ꞌ / sin 67˚54ꞌ
T = 112.06 m.
9. Determine the value of chainage of point of the compound curve, if the chainage at T1 is given as 226.43m and the curve length as 23.64m.
a) 205.07
b) 250.07
c) 207.7
d) 202.79
b
Chainage at P.C.C = chainage of T1 + curve length. On substitution, we get
Chainage at P.C.C = 226.43 + 23.64
Chainage at P.C.C = 250.07 m.
10. If the radius of curvature is given as 76.98m and the deflection angle as 45˚21ꞌ, find the short curve length of a compound curve.
a) 60.93m
b) 6.93m
c) 9.63m
d) 3.69m
a
t = R*θ*π/180. On substitution, we get
t = 76.98*45˚21ꞌ*π/180
t = 60.93 m.
11. Find the value of long curve tangent length, if the radius is given as 76.43m and the deflection angle as 54˚32ꞌ.
a) 39.24m
b) 93.42m
c) 39.42m
d) 93.24m
c
t = R*tan (θ/2). On substitution, we get
t = 76.43*tan (54˚32ꞌ/2)
t = 39.42m.
