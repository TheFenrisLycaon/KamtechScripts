11. Calculate the short tangent length, if the radius of curvature is given as 56.21m and the deflection angle as 32˚54ꞌ.
a) 61.6m
b) 116.6m
c) 16.6m
d) 6.6m
c
t = R*tan θ/2. On substitution, we get
t = 56.21*tan (32˚54ꞌ/2)
t = 16.6m.
12. Determine the common tangent of a reverse curve if the radius of curvature and deflection angles is given as, 43.57m, 32˚43ꞌ and 65˚76ꞌ.
a) 217.087m
b) 127.087m
c) 127.807m
d) 127.708m
b
d = 43.57(tan32˚43ꞌ + tan65˚76ꞌ)
d = 127.087m.
13. Find the value of tangent distance, possessing radius of curvature as 24.89m, common tangent 65m length and having deflection angles as 24˚56ꞌ and 76˚32ꞌ.
a) 64.5m
b) 46.5m
c) 64.98m
d) 62.5m
a
T = R*tan (θ1/2) + d * \(\frac{sin θ_1}{sin θ}\). On substitution, we get
T = 24.89*tan (24˚56ꞌ/2) + 65 * \(\frac{sin 76˚32ꞌ}{sin (24˚56ꞌ + 76˚32ꞌ)}\)
T = 64.5m.
14. Calculate the chainage of P.R.C, if the chainage of Tangent is 567.54m and the curve length is about 65m.
a) 623.54m
b) 632.45m
c) 362.54m
d) 632.54m
d
Chainage of P.R.C = chainage of tangent + length of arc
Chainage of P.R.C = 567.54 + 65
Chainage of P.R.C = 632.54m.
15. If the radii of the curves in a reverse curve are equal, calculate the distance between the tangent points T1 and T2. Assume R = 98.54m with deflection angle 54˚31ꞌ.
a) 108.52m
b) 180.52m
c) 180.25m
d) 108.25m
b
L = 4*R*sin (θ/2). On substitution, we get
L = 4*98.54*sin (54˚31ꞌ/2)
L = 180.52m.
