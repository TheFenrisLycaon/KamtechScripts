b) Sighting
c) Contouring
d) Traversing
c
4. It is difficult for reproducing the traverse in different scale.
a) False
b) True
b
5. Which of the following can be a disadvantage to plane table surveying?
a) Heavy instruments
b) Convenient in wet climate
c)  No Accuracy in output
d) Not used in magnetic areas
a
6. Possibility of error in plane table surveying is ____________

d
7. Let the instrument station be V and there is a displacement of 50 cm in its placement in the direction of ray. What is the true position if the scale is 1cm = 700 meters?
a) 0.017 cm
b) 0.107 cm
c) 0.071 cm
d) 0.170 cm
c
a*aꞌ = e*s meters. The value of s can be given as s = 1/700 and e = 50 cm. On substitution, we get
a*aꞌ = 50/700 = 0.071 cm.
