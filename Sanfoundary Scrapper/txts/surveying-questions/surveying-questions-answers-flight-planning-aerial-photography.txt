1. Overlapping in the direction of flight can be described as_____________
a) Forward overlap
b) Side lap
c) Backward overlap
d) Adjacent overlap
a
2. Which of the following indicates the correct set of overlapping percentage?
a) 50-60%
b) 55-70%
c) 50-70%
d) 55-60%
d
3. Overlapping occurred due to adjacent flight lines can be termed as__________
a) Front lap
b) Forward lap
c) Side lap
d) Straight lap
c
4. Determine the distance of flight strips if the height lens placed is given as 56m.
a) 68.32m
b) 86.32m
c) 68.56m
d) 86.39m
a
W = 1.22*56
W = 68.32m.
5. What will be the distance between the flight strips if the value at point B is given as 6m?
a) 28m
b) 12m
c) 21m
d) 124m
b
W = 2*6
W = 12m.

6. The formula for determining the distance between flight strips can be given as_________
a) W = 1.22+H
b) W = 1.22-H
c) W = 1.22/H
d) W = 1.22*H
d
7. Overlapping increases the amount of work to be done.
a) True
b) False
a
8. The relation between normal direction of flight and the rectangular area can be given as_________
a) 2W = 2*B
b) W = 2*B
c) 3W = 2*B
d) 4W = 2*B
b
9. Calculate the flying height if the contour interval is given as 6m.
a) 300km
b) 300m
c) 3000m
d) 3000cm
c
Flying height = contour interval * c-factor. The value of c-factor lies in between 500-1500. On substitution, we get
Flying height = 6*500 = 3000m.
10. Unless the area is mapped, W value must be reduced.
a) False
b) True
b
11. The value of c-factor lies in between ____________
a) 500-1500
b) 50-1500
c) 50-150
d) 150-550
a
12. Which of the following is not considered while calculating distance between flight strips?
a) Vertical photographs
b) Mitigating crab
c) Eradicating drift of the aircraft
d) Line of sight
d
