11. Determine the super elevation, if the width of the road can be given as 2.96m, radius of curve as 62.96m, vehicle speed = 56m/s.
a) 51.303m
b) 51.03m
c) 15.03m
d) 15.3m
c
e = Bv2/g*R. on substitution, we get
e = 2.96*562 / 9.81*62.96
e = 15.03m.
12. If the super elevation for a road is given as 24m, find the length of transition curve.
a) 15.6 km
b) 15.6 m
c) 15.6 cm
d) 15.6 mm
a
L = n*e, the value of n varies in between 300-1200. Assume the value of n = 650. On substitution, we get
L = 650*24
L = 15600 m. = 15.6 km.
13. Using intrinsic equation, find the value of the length of curve between two points of a 45m transition curve having radius 24.76m with an inclination of 8˚43ꞌ.
a) 319.37m
b) 913.37m
c) 139.73m
d) 139.37m
d
\( l = \sqrt{2RLθ}.\) On substitution, we get
\(l = \sqrt{2*24.76*45*8˚43ꞌ}\) 
l = 139.37m.
14. If the radius of curvature of a curve being 45.42m with an inclination of 7˚52ꞌ. The value of s and L corresponds to 2 and 56m respectively, find the total tangent length of a transition curve.
a) 03.02m
b) 30.02m
c) 2.3m
d) 3.2m
b
(R+s)*tan (θ/2) + L*(1 – \(\frac{s}{R}\)) / 2. On substitution, we get
= (45.42+2)*tan (7˚52ꞌ/2) + 56*(1 – \(\frac{2}{45.42}\)) / 2
= 30.02m.
15. In a cubic parabola, if the value of x co-ordinate is 7, radius of the curve is given as 42.69m and the length of the curve as 24m. Find the y co-ordinate.
a) 2.76
b) 1.05
c) 0.05
d) 5
c
y = x3 / 6*R*L. on substitution, we get
y = 73 / 6*42.69*24
y = 0.05.
