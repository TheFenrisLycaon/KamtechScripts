1. Which of the following doesn’t describe the use of hydrographic surveying?
a) Laying an Alignment
b) Making underground investigations
c) Nautical charts for navigation
d) Establishing mean sea level
d
2. The process of measuring depth below the water surface is called _______
a) Sounding
b) Chaining
c) Traversing
d) Compass traversing
a
3. Which among the following can be possessed by the horizontal control?
a) Chaining
b) Triangulation
c) Theodolite
d) Compass
b
4. Transit tape is used in case of small survey.
a) False
b) True
b
5. Gauge readings are obtained after_______________
a) Compass survey
b) Chaining
c) Sounding
d) Traversing
c
6. Which of the following doesn’t come under the category of shore line survey?
a) Delineation of shore line
b) Location of shore details
c) Determination of the low and high water lines
d) Sounding
d
7. Which among the following doesn’t indicate the purpose of sounding?
a) Volume measurements
b) Nautical charts for navigation
c) Making sub-aqueous investigations
d) Measurement of area
a
8. What will be the salinity of the sea water if the temperature of the sea water is about 45˚C and the velocity of sound is given as 1678 m/s?
a) 314.62
b) 214.62
c) 134.62
d) 143.62
c
1678 = 1410 + 4.21*45 – 0.037*452 + 1.14*S
S = 134.62.
9. Among the following, which is having more prominence while conducting sounding?
a) Labor
b) Signal
c) Sounding pole
d) Suitable climatic conditions
c
10. What is length of the sounding rod or pole?
a) 7-8 m
b) 5-8 m
c) 10-18 m
d) 15-18 m
b
11. The velocity of sound in sea can be determined by ____________
a) Refraction
b) Reflection
c) Polarization
d) Sounding machine
d
12. Determine the velocity of the sound in sea water if the surface temperature can be given as 32˚C and the salinity is given as 2.43.
a) 1590.6 m/s
b) 1509.6 m/s
c) 5109.6 m/s
d) 1590.9 m/s
b
V = 1410 + 4.21*T – 0.037* T2 + 1.14*S. on substitution, we get
V = 1410 + 4.21*32 – 0.037*322 + 1.14*2.43
V = 1509.6 m/s.
13. Find the value of the surface temperature, if the velocity of the sound in sea water can be given as 2000 m/s and the salinity as 5.32.
a) 57˚C
b) 75˚C
c) 52˚C
d) 72˚C
a
2000 = 1410 + 4.21*T – 0.037*T2 + 1.14*5.32
T = 57˚C (approximately).
