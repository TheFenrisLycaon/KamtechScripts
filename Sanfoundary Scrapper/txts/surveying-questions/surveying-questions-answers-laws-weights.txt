1. The laws of weight are established on the basis of____________
a) Observed equation
b) Normal equation
c) Least squares
d) Probability equation
c
2. In the laws of weight, weight is inversely proportional to length.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Weight of the equation remains unchanged even when the signs in the equation are changed.
a) True
b) False
a
4. Find the arithmetic mean if the angles and their weights were given as 20˚42ꞌ3ꞌꞌ, 20˚42ꞌ4ꞌꞌ, 20˚42ꞌ6ꞌꞌ and 2, 2, 2 respectively.
a) 20˚42ꞌ6.3ꞌꞌ
b) 20˚42ꞌ5.3ꞌꞌ
c) 20˚42ꞌ1.3ꞌꞌ
d) 20˚42ꞌ4.3ꞌꞌ
d
Mean = 20˚42ꞌ + (1/3)*(3ꞌꞌ + 4ꞌꞌ + 6ꞌꞌ)
Mean = 20˚42ꞌ4.3ꞌꞌ.
5. Determine the weight of the weighted arithmetic mean if the angles and their weights are given as 40˚56ꞌ2ꞌꞌ, 40˚56ꞌ7ꞌꞌ, 40˚56ꞌ12ꞌꞌ and 5, 4, 9 respectively.
a) 13
b) 18
c) 81
d) 10
b
Weight of the arithmetic mean = 5+ 4+ 9 = 18.
6. Find the weight of the algebraic sum of the two quantities given as 21˚43ꞌ10ꞌꞌ, 54˚32ꞌ20ꞌꞌ, having weights 5, 7 respectively.
a) 13*35
b) 13/35
c) 35/13
d) 48
c
Summation = 1/5 + 1/7 = 13 / 35.
Weight of α+ β = (76˚15ꞌ30ꞌꞌ) = 1/ (13/35) = 35 /13.
7. If the angle α = 54˚32ꞌ12ꞌꞌ, having weight 7, is multiplied by a factor 5 then find the resulting weight of that angle.
a) 7/25
b) 25/7
c) 175
d) 571
a
5α = (272˚41ꞌ) = 7 / 52 = 7 / 25.
8. Find the weight of the equation α+ β = 23˚45ꞌ20ꞌꞌ if it is multiplied by its own weight. Weight of the equation is given as 2.
a) 2
b) 1/2
c) 4
d) 5
b
2*(α+ β) = 47˚30ꞌ40ꞌꞌ, weight = 1⁄2.
9. Determine the weight of the quantity β = 21˚54ꞌ13ꞌꞌ if it is divides by a factor 3. Its original weight is 8.
a) 9/8
b) 8/9
c) 27
d) 72
d
β/3 = 7˚18ꞌ4.3ꞌꞌ = 8*(32) = 72.
10. What will be the value of weight if the equation α+ β = 32˚18ꞌ7ꞌꞌ having weight 5 is subtracted by 180˚?
a) 3
b) 5/3
c) 5
d) 2
c
180˚- 32˚18ꞌ7ꞌꞌ = 147˚41ꞌ53ꞌꞌ, weight of the equation = 5.
