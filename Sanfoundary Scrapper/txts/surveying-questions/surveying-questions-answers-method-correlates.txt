1. In order to form a normal equation _____________ are needed.
a) Algebraic coefficients
b) Probability equation
c) Probability law
d) Probability curve
a
2. Correlates can also be known as _____________
a) Unknown multiples
b) Known multiples
c) Eccentric multiples
d) Centric multiples
a
3. All conditions are to be collected and used in which of the following case?
a) Most probable value
b) Normal equation
c) Method of correlates
d) Probability law
c
4. Determine the value of correction if the wave length is given as 25m, having weight 6.
a) 2.87
b) 7.14
c) 1.47
d) 4.17
d
E = λ / w. On substitution, we get
E = 25 / 6
E = 4.17.
5. Which of the following condition is to be used when the equal weights are introduced?
a) e12 – e22 – e32 = 0
b) e12 + e22 + e32 = 0
c) e12 + e22 – e32 = 0
d) e12 – e22 + e32 = 0
b

6. In case of method of correlation, the error is distributed to every observation.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Find the value of E if the wavelengths of different lines are given as 63m and 54m, having weights 6 and 7 respectively.
a) 8.27
b) 2.87
c) 2.78
d) 7.28
c
E = λ1(1/w1 + 1/w2) – λ2(1/w1 + 1/w2). On substitution, we get
E = 63*(1/6 + 1/7) – 54*(1/6 + 1/7)
E = 2.78.
8. Which of the following describes the work done by the method of correlates?
a) Reducing the mean work
b) Neglecting the arithmetic work
c) Increasing the arithmetic work
d) Reducing the arithmetic work
d
9. Ample conditions were used in method of correlates.
a) False
b) True
b
10. If the value of wave length is given as 21m with different weights 6 and 2, find the value of E.
a) 14
b) 13
c) 12
d) 10
a
E = λ*(1/w1 + 1/w2). On substitution, we get
E = 21*(1/6 + 1/2)
E = 14.
