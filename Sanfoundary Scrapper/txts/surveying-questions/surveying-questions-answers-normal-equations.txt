b
4. Determine the normal equation for x for the equations, 5x+2y+3z-6 = 0 and 2x+4y+6z-10 = 0, having equal weight.
a) 29x+18y+27z-50 = 0
b) 18x+29y+27z-50 = 0
c) 27x+18y+29z-50 = 0
d) 29x+81y+27z-50 = 0
a
5*(5x+2y+3z-6 = 0) = 25x+10y+15z-30 = 0 and similarly,
2*(2x+4y+6z-10 = 0) = 4x+8y+12z-20 = 0. On adding we get the normal equation for x i.e.,
29x+18y+27z-50 = 0.

6. Formation of normal equation with unknown quantities must be multiplied with the algebraic coefficient.
a) True
b) False

7. Find the normal equation for y of the equations 2x+3y+4z-7 = 0, x-4y+6z-9 = 0, having weights 3 and 2 respectively.
a) 48x-32y+8z-72 = 0
b) 32x-8y+48z-72 = 0
c) 8x-32y+48z-72 = 0
d) 8x-48y+32z-72 = 0
c
(3*3)*(2x+3y+4z-7=0) = 18x+27y+36z-54 = 0 and similarly,
(4*2)*(x-4y+6z-9=0) = 8x-32y+48z-72 = 0.
8. What will be the normal equation for z if the equations are given as 3x+9y+4z-43=0, 2x+6y+z-5=0. Assume these are having equal weights.
a) 17x+42y+47z-178=0
b) 14x+17y+42z-178=0
c) 14x+42y+17z-178=0
d) 42x+14y+17z-178=0
c
4*(3x+9y+4z-43=0) = 12x+36y+16z-172=0 and
1*(2x+6y+z-5=0) = 2x+6y+z-5=0. On addition, we get the required normal equation,
14x+42y+17z-178=0.

c) 2 consonants, 2 variables
d) 1 consonant, 1 variable
a
