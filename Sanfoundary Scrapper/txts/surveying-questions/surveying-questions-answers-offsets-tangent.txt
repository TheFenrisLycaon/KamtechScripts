1. Which process can be used for setting a small curve?
a) Offsets from radial offsets
b) Offsets from perpendicular tangents
c) Bisection of arcs
d) Offsets from chords
b
2. Which of the following describes the right usage of tangent method for offsets?
a) Smaller radius
b) Larger radius
c) Large deflection angle
d) More tangent length
a
3. The points that are set by using the method of tangents will lie on ___________
a) Tangent
b) Chord
c) Arc of circle
d) Parabola
d
4. If the tangent distance increases, the offsets distance also increases.
a) False
b) True
b
5. Central position of curve can be set by _________
a) Tangent
b) Chord
c) Apex
d) Secant
c
6. Which of the following represents the correct set of classification in the method of setting offset by tangent method?
a) Radial, perpendicular
b) Radial, parallel
c) Parallel, perpendicular
d) Parallel, horizontal
a
7. Find the radial offset if radius of the curve is given as 23.65m and the offset placement is at 15m.
a) 5.63m
b) 5.36m
c) -5.63m
d) -5.36m
d
Ox = (R2 – (x)2)1/2 – R. On substitution, we get
Ox = – 23.65 + (23.652 – (15)2)1/2
Ox = -5.36m.
8. Set a radial offset by using the approximate method with radius of the curve given as 25.76m and the offset distance as 5m.
a) 0.584m
b) 0.845m
c) 0.485m
d) 0.854m
c
Ox = 52 / 2*25.76
Ox = 0.485m.
9. Find the perpendicular offset by using the general method, with radius of the curvature being 70.98m and the offset distance about 9m.
a) 0.57m
b) -0.57m
c) 7.05m
d) -7.05m
b
Ox = (70.982 – (9)2)1/2 – 70.98
Ox = -0.57m.
10. Set a perpendicular offset using the approximate method, having radius of curvature as 47.43m and the offset distance being 8m.
a) 0.67m
b) 0.76m
c) 7.06m
d) 6.07m
a
Ox = 82 / 2*47.43 = 0.67m.
