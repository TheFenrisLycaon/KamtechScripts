1. Which of the following represents the correct set of ordinate rules used?
a) Average ordinate rule, Trapezoidal rule
b) Mid-ordinate rule, Mean ordinate rule
c) Mid-ordinate rule, Average ordinate rule
d) Trapezoidal rule, Mean ordinate rule
c
2. Find the length of the base line if the number of divisions are 4 and d = 1.5m.
a) 2 m
b) 6 m
c) 2.5 m
d) 8 m
b
L = n*d and on substitution, we get
L = 4*1.5 = 6 m.
3. Ordinate rule is based on which of the following assumptions?
a) Boundaries of the offsets are straight lines
b) Boundaries of the offsets are perpendicular
c) Boundaries of the offsets are curves
d) Boundaries of the offsets are parabolic
a
4.  The area of the figure from ordinate rule can be determined as__________
a) A = average ordinate * perimeter
b) A = average ordinate * breadth
c) A = average ordinate * area
d) A = average ordinate * length of base
d
A = average ordinate * length of base
Where, L can be determined by no. of divisions*distance of each division.
5. Calculate the area by mid-ordinate rule if the value of d = 2m and the ordinates are given as 24.69m, 42.96 m, 26.74m.
a) 188.87 sq. m
b) 881.78 sq. m
c) 188.78 sq. m
d) 198.78 sq. m
c
A = d*∑O. On substitution, we get
A = 2 * (24.69+42.96+26.74)
A = 188.78 sq. m.
6. Among the area calculation methods, which is more accurate?
a) Area by co-ordinates
b) Area by Simpson’s one-third rule
c) Area by double mean distances
d) Area by offsets
b
7. Calculate the area by average co-ordinate rule, by using the offsets provided taken at 10m interval.
4.16, 6.34, 7.89, 6.54, 5.67, 7.76, 8.52, 5.87, 6.21 
a) 245.08m
b) 542.08 m
c) 524.08 m
d) 528.04 m
b
Here n = number of divisions = 8; n + 1 = number of ordinates = 8 + 1 = 9
L = Length of base = 10 x 8 = 80 m
∑O = 4.16+6.34+7.89+6.54+5.67+7.76+8.52+5.87+6.21 = 58.96m
Δ = (80*58.96)/9 = 524.089m.
8. Find the value of number of divisions if the area is 543.89 sq. m and the summation of the co-ordinates is given as 223.98 m.
a) 2.42 m
b) 2.24 m
c) 4.22 m
d) 2.56 m
a
d = A/∑O
d = 543.89 / 223.98
d = 2.42m.
9. The calculation of area by ordinate rule and Simpson’s rule will come under which category?
a) Area by double mean distances
b) Area by co-ordinates
c) Area by triangles
d) Area by offsets
d
10. Which of the following indicates the formula for area by average co-ordinate method?
a) Δ = (L * ∑O)/(n+1)
b) Δ = (L * ∑O)/(n-1)
c) Δ = (L + ∑O)/(n+1)
d) Δ = (L – ∑O)/(n+1)
a
Δ = Average ordinate * length of base
Δ = (L * ∑O) / (n+1) where, ∑O = O1+O2+………+On
