c) Zenith
d) Co-ordinates
d
2. The angle between observer meridian and declination circle is given as ____________
a) Hour angle
b) Azimuth
c) Bearing
d) Zenith
a
3. The imaginary sphere on which stars appear to lie is known as __________
a) Cylindrical sphere
b) spheroid
c) Celestial sphere
d) Zenithal sphere
c
4. The point above which the satellite or any celestial body lies is known as _____________
a) Zenith
b) Nadir
c) Visible horizon
d) Latitude
b
5. Which of the following doesn’t represent the co-ordinate system used in determining position of celestial body?
a) Spherical co-ordinate system
b) Horizon system
c) Dependent system
d) Independent system
a
6. The horizon system depends on which of the following?
a) Visible horizon
b) Nadir
c) Zenith
d) Observer’s position
d
7. Zenith distance can be given as z = _____________
a) z = 900 + α
b) z = 900 * α
c) z = 900 – α
d) z = 900 / α
c
8. Equatorial circle is used as a reference in an independent equatorial system.
a) False
b) True
b
9. All the co-ordinates in dependent system will depend on observer’s position.
a) False
b) True
a
10.  In the dependent equatorial system, first co-ordinate represents on _________ and second co-ordinate represents on ____________
a) Nadir, zenith
b) Zenith distance, hour angle
c) Hour angle, declination
d) Zenith, declination
c
11. Determine the spherical excess, if the area of the triangle is given as 32sq. m with radius 65m.
a) 1562.24 m
b) 1526.24 m
c) 1562.42 m
d) 1652.24 m
a
E = Δ / (R2*sin 1ꞌꞌ). On substitution, we get
E = 32 / (652*sin 1ꞌꞌ)
E = 1562.24 m.
12. If the radius of sphere is given as 43m and the spherical excess as 186.54m, find the area of a spherical triangle.
a) 6109.85 sq. m
b) 6019.58 sq. m
c) 6091.85 sq. m
d) 6019.85 sq. m
d
A = πR2E / 180. On substitution, we get
A = π*432*186.54 / 180
A = 6019.85 sq. m.
