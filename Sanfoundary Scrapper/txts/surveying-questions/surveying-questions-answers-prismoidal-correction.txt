1. Correction applied in prismoidal correction is always__________
a) Subtractive
b) Additive
c) Multiplicative
d) Divisible
a
2. The calculation of mid-area is necessary in case of a prismoidal correction.
a) False
b) True
b
3. Which of the following value is necessary in case of determining the correction in prismoid?
a) Volume
b) Area
c) Constants
d) Distance between the sides
d
4. Prismoidal correction can be given as________
a) Addition between the volume calculated and that obtained from the prismoid formula
b) Summation  between the volume calculated and that obtained from the prismoid formula
c) Difference between the volume calculated and that obtained from the prismoid formula
d) Product between the volume calculated and that obtained from the prismoid formula
c
5. Prismoidal correction is obtained from which of the following formulae?
a) Prismoid formula
b) Trapezoidal formula
c) Square formula
d) Rectangular formula
a
6. Find the prismoidal correction, if the area of cross sections were given as 114.65 sq. m and 56.76 sq. m, which are 2 m distant apart having 3 sides.
a) 2214.24
b) 3315.26
c) 3531.25
d) 3351.25
d
Cp = d n(h-h1)2/6. On substitution, we get
Cp = 2*3(114.65-56.76)2/6
Cp = 3351.25.
7. If the areas of cross sections of one side area given as 117.86 sq. m, 105.76 sq. m and the other side as 98.76 sq. m, 86.54 sq. m. the values of b, n, m, mꞌ and d are given as 2, 3, 4,4 and 1 respectively. Find the correction of prismoid in case of side hill section.
a) 36.9
b) 30.6
c) 29.1
d) 26.6
b
Cp = d (w-w1)*(b/2 – b/2 + m*h – mꞌ*hꞌ)/12*n. On substitution, we get
Cp = 1 (117.86-98.76) * (4*105.76 – 4*86.54) / 12*3
Cp = 30.6.
8. Prismoidal correction can be applied to which of the following formulae?
a) Rectangular formula
b) Square formula
c) Trapezoidal formula
d) Quadrilateral formula
c
9. Find the correction applied for two-level section if area of cross sections at different sides were given as 115.31, 165.72 and 65.87, 54.23,which unit distant apart having number of sides 2.
a) 459.33
b) 495.33
c) 594.33
d) 543.22
a
Cp = d*(w-wꞌ)*(w1-w1ꞌ) / 6*n. on substitution,
We get Cp = 1 (115.31-65.87)*(165.72-54.23) / 6*2 = 459.33.
10. What will be the correction for three level sections, if the areas of 3 different sides, which are having unit distance are 121.31 sq. m, 145.76 sq. m, 176.65 sq. m and 45.87 sq. m, 45.67 sq. m, 72.43 sq. m?
a) -89.76
b) 25.92
c) -52.98
d) -25.96
d
Cp = d*(h-hꞌ)*(w-wꞌ+w1-w1ꞌ) / 12. On substitution, we get
Cp = 1*(121.31-45.87)*(145.76-45.67 +176.65-72.43) / 12
Cp = -25.96.
