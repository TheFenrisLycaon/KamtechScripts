1. A prismoid is a combination of which of the following?
a) Trapezium, circle
b) Parallelogram, trapezium
c) Triangle, trapezium
d) Triangle, circle
c
2. The trapezoidal and prismoidal formulae were derived based on the assumption that end sections are in parallel planes.
a) True
b) False
a
3. Prismoidal rule is also known as__________
a) Simpson’s rule
b) Trapezoidal rule
c) Curvature rule
d) Euler’s rule
a
4. The prismoidal formula is used for the calculation of__________
a) Perimeter
b) Traverse
c) Volume
d) Area
c
5. Calculate the total volume if number of sides = 3 and d = 2 m. The values of area can be given as 117.98 sq. m, 276.54 sq. m and 98.43 sq. m.
a) 1170.26 cu. m
b) 1710.26 cu. m
c) 1107.26 cu. m
d) 117.26 cu. m
a
V = d/3 (A1 + A3 + 4*A2 + 2A3 + 2A1). On substitution, we get
V = 2/3 (117.98 + 98.43 + 4*276.54 + 2*98.43 + 2*117.98)
V = 1170.26 cu. m.
6. In prisomidal rule, it is necessary to have odd number cross sections.
a) False
b) True
b
7. Which of the following must be done for obtaining equivalent area?
a) Applying correction for bearings
b) Applying correction for angles
c) Applying correction for curvature
d) Applying correction for length
c
8. If the area of mid section is 345.98 sq. m and the individual areas A1, A2 are 123.31 and 157.31 respectively, d = 5m. Find the volume of the pyramid.
a) 3187.11 cu. m
b) 1378.11 cu. m
c) 1837.11 cu. m
d) 1387.11 cu. m
d
V = d/6 (A1+A2+4Am). On substitution, we get
V = 5/6 (123.31 + 157.31 + 4*345.98)
V = 1387.11 cu. M.
9. Which of the following indicates the formula for prisomidal correction?
a) Cp = d n (h+h1)2/6
b) Cp = d n (h-h1)2/6
c) Cp = d n (h*h1)2/6
d) Cp = d n (h/h1)2/6
b
10. Find the area of first prismoid if the areas of A1, A2 and A3 are 145.31, 257.43 and 59.67 respectively with a distance of 2.5 m.
a) 1208.91 cu. m
b) 1082.91 cu. m
c) 1028.91 cu. m
d) 1820.91 cu. m
c
V = d/3 (A1 + 4*A2 + A3)
V = 2.5/3 (145.31 + 4*257.43 + 59.67)
V = 1028.91 cu. M.
