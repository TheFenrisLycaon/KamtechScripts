1. Rain gauge is used for ________
a) Hydrological survey
b) Measuring precipitation
c) Marine survey
d) River survey
b
2. Rain gauge is expressed in terms of _________
a) Decimeters
b) Meters
c) Centimeters
d) Millimeters
d
3. Calculate the total rainfall in an interval, where volume of the bucket is taken as 24cu. m and time interval N = 3.
a) 72cu. m
b) 2cu. m
c) 27cu. m
d) 72sq. m
a
Rainfall = N*v. on substitution, we get
Rainfall = 3*24 = 72cu. m.
4. Find the least count of the instrument used in case of rainfall determination, if the volume of the bucket is 50cu. m and the area of the funnel is about 21 sq. m.
a) 3.38 m
b) 2.83 m
c) 2.38 m
d) 4.38 m
c
K = v / A. on substitution, we get
K = 50 / 21 = 2.38 m.
5. What would be the rate of rainfall if the value of N can be given as 2 and the difference in time can be given as 24 sec with the L.C of the instrument as 1m?
a) 50m-sec
b) 48m-sec
c) 42m-sec
d) 49m-sec
b
R = N*k*δt. On substitution, we get
R = 2*1*24
R = 48m-sec.
6. Tipping bucket used in the rain gauge will turn under the action of ___________
a) Battery
b) Hand movement
c) Gravity
d) Motor
c
7. Which of the following rain gauge equipment is used in case of remote areas?
a) Reflective rain gauge
b) Acoustic rain gauge
c) Optical rain gauge
d) Tipping bucket
d
8. Rain gauge is also known as __________
a) Udometer
b) Opto meter
c) Luda meter
d) Rio meter
a
9. Which of the following will not come under the classification of rain gauge?
a) Tipping bucket gauge.
b) Reflective rain gauge
c) Optical rain gauge
d) Acoustic rain gauge
b
10. Acoustic rain gauge can also be known as__________
a) Hydro gauge
b) Hydro remote
c) Hydrophone
d) Hydro cable
c
