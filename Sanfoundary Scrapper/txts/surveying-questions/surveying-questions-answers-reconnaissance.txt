a) True
b) False
a
2. Which of the following is not necessary for Reconnaissance process?
a) Sextant
b) Theodolite
c) Chain
d) Aneroid Barometer
c
3. Height of the instrument depends upon __________
a) Elevation differences
b) Type of terrain present
c) Type of instrument used
d) Distance between stations
d
4. Height of the station above datum is given as __________
a) \(h = \frac{D^2 (1-2m)}{2R}\) 
b) \(h = \frac{D^2 (1-2m)}{2}\) 
c) \(h = \frac{D^2 (1+2m)}{2R}\) 
d) \(h = \frac{D(1-2m)}{2R}\) 
a
5. In the process of Reconnaissance, which of the following is determined?
a) Slope
b) Elevation
c) Gradient
d) Distance between stations
b
6. Reconnaissance process will give best output only on elevated grounds.
a) False
b) True
b
7. While calculating h2 with reference to h1, line of sight must be ______ m above the point of tangency.
a) 5-6 m
b) 4-5 m
c) 3-4 m
d) 2-3 m
d
8. For proper identification, station marks are marked with___________
a) Wood
b) Plastic
c) Copper
d) Concrete
c
9. Besides theodolite which among the following is used for taking angles.
a) Compass
b) Only theodolite
c) Total station
d) Sextant
d
10. Determine the height of the station if the distance between the visible horizon is 44km.
a) 121.54m
b) 211.54m
c) 121.45m
d) 211.45m
a
h = D2*(1-2m) / 2*R. here, m= 0.07, radius of earth = 6370km. On substitution, we get
h = 442*(1-2*0.07) / 2*6370
h = 121.54m.
11. Find the distance between the visible horizon, if the height of the station is given as 2.98m.
a) 8.66m
b) 6.88m
c) 8.68m
d) 2.86m
b
\(D = \sqrt{\frac{h}{0.06278}}\). On substitution, we get
\(D = \sqrt{\frac{2.98}{0.06278}}\)
D = 6.88m.
