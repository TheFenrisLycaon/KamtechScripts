1. Height of the Instrument method is a less tedious and simple process.
a) False
b) True
b
2. While doing construction work, which among the following is more suitable?
a) Rise and Fall method
b) Traversing
c) Height of the Instrument method(H.I)
d) Compass Surveying
c
3. The formula for calculating R.L can be given as _________
a) H.I+F.S
b) H.I-F.S
c) H.I-B.S
d) H.I+B.S
b
4. Which of the following indicates the formula for arithmetic check?
a) ΣB.S-ΣF.S=Last R.L-First R.L
b) ΣF.S-ΣB.S=Last R.L-First R.L
c) ΣB.S+ΣF.S=First R.L-Last R.L
d) ΣF.S+ΣB.S=Last R.L-First R.L
a
5. Rise and fall method provides check in calculations for all sights.
a) True
b) False
a
6. Which of the following represents a form of Bench Mark (B.M)?
a) True Benchmark
b) Assumed Benchmark
c) Datum
d) Arbitrary Benchmark
d
7. If the staff at the station point is not held vertically, the R.L at the observation would be ______________
a) Less than true R.L
b) Greater than true R.L
c) Equal to the true R.L
d) Two times the true R.L
c
8. If the R.L of a B.M is 100m and back sight is 1.225m, find the H.I at the station?
a) 101.225m
b) -101.225m
c) 98.775m
d) -98.775m
a
Then, H.I= 100+1.225 H.I=101.225 m.
9. The combined correction for curvature and refraction can be given as _______
a) C = 14d2/6R
b) C = 6d2/7R
c) C = 7d2/2R
d) C = 6d2/14R
d
10. Find the correction for curvature and correction for refraction, if the value of d = 2400 m?
a) 0.425, 0.604
b) 0.452, 0.064
c) 0.064, 0.452
d) 0.604, 0.425
b
Correction for refraction \( = \frac{1}{7} * C_c = \frac{0.452}{7} = 0.064m.\)
11. Find the value of R.L, if B.M = 400 m, B.S = 1.142 m, F.S = 2.121 by using rise and fall method?
a) 400.79 m
b) 400.97 m
c) 409.79 m
d) 399.02 m
d
12. If d = 2.94 km, what would be the combined correction for curvature and refraction?
a) 1.85 km
b) 0.85 km
c) 0.58 km
d) 1.58 km
c
On substituting the value the of d in the above equation we get,
\(C = \frac{6d^2}{14R} = \frac{6*2.94^2}{14*6370} = 0.5814 km.\)
