1. The relation between altitude and latitude of the observer can be given as__________
a) Equal
b) Minimum
c) Maximum
d) Not equal
a
2. The sign for the deflection angle depends upon _______________
a) Altitude
b) Zenith
c) Celestial body
d) Horizon
c
3. Determine the latitude of the observer if the altitude of the pole is given as 23˚41ꞌ.
a) 32˚14ꞌ
b) 32˚41ꞌ
c) 23˚14ꞌ
d) 23˚41ꞌ
d
θ = α. So, the value of latitude of the observer can be given as
θ = 23˚41ꞌ. 
4. Find the latitude of the observer if the declination is about 54˚32ꞌ having a meridian zenith of about 10m.
a) 64˚2ꞌ
b) 64˚32ꞌ
c) 46˚32ꞌ
d) 64˚23ꞌ
b
θ = δ + z. On substitution, we get
θ = 54˚32ꞌ +10
θ = 64˚32ꞌ.
5. Find the difference of longitude between A = 30˚E and B = 160˚E.
a) 130˚
b) 310˚
c) 13˚
d) 30˚
a
B – A = 160˚- 30˚ = 130˚. In case of change in direction, the angle must be subtracted or multiplied with 180. This will help in change in its direction.
6. If longitudes of A and B are given as 32˚12ꞌ W, 44˚2ꞌ W having latitude 29˚24ꞌ. Find the distance in km between the points A and B.
a) 19.54km
b) 91.1km
c) 11.9km
d) 19.1km
d
Distance = difference of longitude * cos latitude. On substitution, we get
Distance = (44˚2ꞌ W – 32˚12ꞌ W)*cos29˚24ꞌ * 1.852
Distance = 19.1km.
7. Which of the following indicates the formula for hour angle of equinox?
a) Hour angle of star-  R.A of the star
b) Hour angle of star+  R.A of the star
c) Hour angle of star /  R.A of the star
d) Hour angle of star*  R.A of the star
b
8. The distance between the points in a celestial body can be determined by using __________
a) Napier’s rule
b) Celestial rule
c) Zenithal rule
d) Obligate rule
a
9. Determine the zenith distance if the declination of star is given as 74˚32ꞌ and the latitude of the observer as 54˚21ꞌ.
a) 0˚12ꞌ
b) 2˚11ꞌ
c) 20˚11ꞌ
d) 20˚15ꞌ
c
Zenith distance = ZP – AP
Zenith distance = (90-θ)- (90-δ)
Zenith distance = 90-54˚21ꞌ-90+74˚32ꞌ
Zenith distance = 20˚11ꞌ.
10. If the zenith distance is given as 26˚57ꞌ, find the altitude of the star at upper culmination.
a) 63˚30ꞌ
b) 36˚3ꞌ
c) 3˚36ꞌ
d) 63˚3ꞌ
d
= 90 – zenith distance
= 90 – 26˚57ꞌ
= 63˚3ꞌ.
