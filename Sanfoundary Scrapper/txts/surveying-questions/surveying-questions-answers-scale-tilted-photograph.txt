1. Which of the following photographs may have a varying scale?
a) Datum photograph
b) Horizontal photograph
c) Vertical photograph
d) Tilted photograph
d
2. Among the following, which must be known for determining scale in a tilted photograph?
a) Focal length
b) Datum height
c) Azimuth
d) Zenith
a
3. The geometric process involved in the determination of scale for titled photograph is____________
a) Spherical
b) Cylindrical
c) Analytical
d) Co-ordinate
c
4. Which of the following indicates the formula of scale for a tilted photograph?
a) sh = (f*sec t / mn*sin t) / (H-h)
b) sh = (f*sec t * mn*sin t) / (H-h)
c) sh = (f*sec t + mn*sin t) / (H-h)
d) sh = (f*sec t – mn*sin t) / (H-h)
d
5. Which of the following is not recommended in case of determining the scale of a tilted photograph?
a) Axis
b) Focal length
c) Height of the point
d) Tilt
a
6. Length of the line considered in case of determining scale of tilted photograph can be determined by ____________
a) \(L = \sqrt{(X_a+X_b)^2/(Y_a+Y_b)^2}\) 
b) \(L = \sqrt{(X_a+X_b)^2+(Y_a+Y_b)^2}\) 
c) \(L = \sqrt{(X_a+X_b)^2*(Y_a+Y_b)^2}\) 
d) \(L = \sqrt{(X_a+X_b)^2-(Y_a+Y_b)^2}\) 
b
\(L = \sqrt{(X_a+X_b)^2+(Y_a+Y_b)^2}\). This is established by using the co-ordinates of the points taken while having their measurements.
7. Which of the following type of photograph can be used for the generation of maps?
a) Tilted photograph
b) Vertical photograph
c) Horizontal photograph
d) Datum photograph
b
8. Determine the length of the line AB having co-ordinates (2, 4), (6, 7).
a) 3.16m
b) 31.6m
c) 13.6m
d) 13.9m
c
\(L = \sqrt{(X_a+X_b)^2+(Y_a+Y_b)^2}\). On substitution, we get
\(L = \sqrt{(2+6)^2+(4+7)^2 )}\) 
L = 13.6m.
9. Flying height can be determined by using tilted photograph.
a) True
b) False
a
10. For identification of length of a line, co-ordinates must be known.
a) True
b) False
a
