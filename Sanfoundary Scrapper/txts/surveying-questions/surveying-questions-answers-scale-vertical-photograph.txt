1. Variation in scale of photograph can take place due variation in_____________
a) Datum
b) Azimuth
c) Zenith
d) Elevation
d
2. Which of the following indicates the formula for scale?
a) Ground distance / map distance
b) Map distance / ground distance
c) Map distance / elevation point
d) Elevation point / map distance
b
3. Scale at elevation point in photograph can be given as_____________
a) S = f/ (H – h)
b) S = f/ (H + h)
c) S = f/ (H * h)
d) S = f/ (- H + h)
a
4. Which of the following can also be used in order to determine the scale of a photograph?
a) Recurring fraction
b) Reciprocating fraction
c) Representation fraction
d) Reducing fraction
c
5. If all the ground points are projected vertically downward on the mean sea level, which scale is recommended to be used?
a) Datum scale
b) Average scale
c) Azimuth scale
d) Reference scale
a
6. The formula for average scale can be given as______________
a) S = f / (H+hav)
b) S = f / (H*hav)
c) S = f / (-H+hav)
d) S = f / (H-hav)
d
7. Which of the following indicates the right step for determination of scale?
a) Measuring ground distance
b) Comparing angles
c) Joining elevation points
d) Comparing zenith levels
c
8. The value of horizontal distance can be determined by which of the following methods?
a) Traversing
b) Triangulation
c) Theodolite surveying
d) Compass surveying
b
9. Determine the scale at elevation point if the values of focal length, height of station and the height of mean sea level are given by 23cm, 76cm and 20cm.
a) 0.41cm
b) 0.4cm
c) 4.41cm
d) 1.41cm
a
S = f/ (H – h). On substitution, we get
S = 23/ (76 – 20)
S = 0.41cm.
10. What will be the average elevation of terrain if the scale is given as 43m, focal length and height of the station as 4m and 20m?
a) 19.19 m
b) 91.91 m
c) 9.91 m
d) 9.9 m
d
S = f / (H-hav). On substitution, we get
43 = 4/ (20-hav)
hav = 19.91 m.
11. Photographic scale can be determined by using the photo distance.
a) True
b) False
a
12. For finding the scale of a photograph, the points must be equally elevated.
a) False
b) True
b
