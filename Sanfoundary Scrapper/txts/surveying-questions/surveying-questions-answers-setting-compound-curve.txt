b) Deflection angles
c) Bisection of arcs
d) Tacheometric method
b
3. In a compound curve, the point at which both the long curve and short curve will meet is called_________
a) Point of radius
b) Point of curvature curve
c) Point of compound curve
d) Point of deflection curve
c
4. For setting a compound curve, the theodolite is first placed at______________
a) P.I
b) P.C.C
c) P.T
d) P.C
d
5. Find the value of radius of curvature, if the degree of the curve is given as 7˚.
a) 136.71 m
b) 163.17 m
c) 163.71 m
d) 613.71 m
c
R = 1146 / D. On substitution, we get
R = 1146 / 7˚
R = 163.71 m.
6. Determine the value of long curve length of a compound curve, if the radius of curvature is given as 56.87m and the deflection angle is given as 65˚43ꞌ.
a) 56.22m
b) 65.22m
c) 65.44m
d) 69.22m
b
t = R*θ*π/180. On substitution, we get
t = 56.87*65˚43ꞌ*π/180
t = 65.22m.
7. Find the value of the chainage of T1 by using the chainage of P.I and the tangent distance is given as 1024.31m and 707.57m.
a) 616.74m
b) 313.74m
c) 613.74m
d) 316.74m
d
Chainage of T1 = chainage of P.I – Ts. On substitution, we get
Chainage of T1 = 1024.31-707.57
Chainage of T1 = 316.74m.
8. Determine the short curve tangent distance by using the short curve and long curve tangent lengths given as 54.98m and 89.32m. The deflection angles at P.I and at long curve are given as 86˚45ꞌ and 43˚31ꞌ.
a) 154.5 m
b) 145.5 m
c) 514.5 m
d) 451.5 m
a
\(T = t_s + (t_s + t_l)* \frac{sin θ_2}{sin θ}.\) On substitution, we get
\(T = 54.98 + (54.98 + 89.32)* \frac{sin 43˚31ꞌ}{sin 86˚45ꞌ}\) 
T = 154.5 m.
9. Find the chainage of second tangent point, if the chainage at the point of compound curve is given as 2345.87m and the curve length can be given as 568.54m.
a) 2941.41 m
b) 9214.41 m
c) 2914.14 m
d) 2914.41 m
d
Chainage at T2 = chainage at P.C.C + curve length. On substitution, we get
Chainage at T2 = 2345.87 + 568.54
Chainage at T2 = 2914.41 m.
10. All the necessary calculations will be done before setting the curve.
a) True
b) False
b
