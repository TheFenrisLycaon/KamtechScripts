1. Which among the following indicates the correct set of methods for setting out a simple curve?
a) Angular method, curvature method
b) Linear method, angular method
c) Curvature method, linear method
d) Tangent method, curvature method
b
2. In linear method of setting out curve, which of the following is not used?
a) Tape
b) Chain
c) Theodolite
d) Compass
c
3. Which of the following methods is used when curve to be designed is short?
a) Linear method
b) Angular method
c) Tangent method
d) Curvature method
a
4. In angular method of setting a curve, which of the following is used?
a) Compass
b) Tape
c) Chain
d) Theodolite
d
5. For setting the tangent, which process is most commonly used?
a) Rankine’s method
b) Trial and error method
c) Tacheometric method
d) Two theodolite method
b
6. P.T, P.I, P.C are the basic requirements for setting a curve.
a) True
b) False
a
7. Which of the following doesn’t indicate the linear method of setting out the curve?
a) By offsets from chords produced
b) By offsets from the tangents
c) By curves
d) By offsets of long chords
c
8. Find the value of radius if the value of D is given as 23.76m.
a) 214.98m
b) 241.61m
c) 214.16m
d) 241.16m
d
R = 5730/D. On substitution, we get
R = 5730 / 23.76
R = 241.16 m.
9. Find the value of length of the curve if the degree of curve is taken at 20m arc with an angle 42˚12ꞌ.
a) 24.9m
b) 24.2m
c) 42.2 m
d) 49.2m
c
l = 20*42˚12ꞌ / 20
l = 42.2 m.
10. The length of the chord must not be greater than one tenth of radius.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Using the degree of curvature, find the value of radius of curve if the distance is given as 24.65 m.
a) 64.49m
b) 46.49m
c) 46.94m
d) 64.94m
b
R = 1146 / 24.65 = 46.49 m.
