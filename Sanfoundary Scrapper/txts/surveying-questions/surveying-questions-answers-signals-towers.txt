11. The figure belongs to which of the following classifications?
a) Night signal
b) Luminous signals
c) Non-luminous signals

c
12. What will be the face correction made on bright line, if the radius of the signal is given as 24m, angle with which the station points make with the sun is given as 24˚12ꞌ and the distance between the station points is given as 85m?
a) 953˚11ꞌ
b) 59˚11ꞌ
c) 359˚11ꞌ
d) 593˚11ꞌ
d
β = 206265*r*cos (α/2) / D. On substitution, we get
β = 206265*2*cos (24˚12ꞌ/2) / 85
β = 593˚11ꞌ.
