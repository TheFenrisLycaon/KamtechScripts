b) Movable hair method
c) Subtense method
d) Tangential method
a
3. Which among the following represents stadia interval factor?
a) f + d
b) f – d
c) f / i
d) i/ f
c
D = (f/i)*s + (f+d)
D = K*s + C
Where K is the stadia interval factor (or) the multiplying constant and C is the additive constant.
4. What is the formula for finding vertical distance if the staff is held vertical and line of sight is inclined?

6. Usage of anallactic lens makes the entire process more simple and reliable.
a) True
b) False
a
cause for potential errors.
7. A tacheometer is setup at A and the readings on the staff at B are 1.77m, 2.12m, 2.34m and the inclination of line of sight is + 10 9ꞌ. Calculate the vertical distance between A and B. Take k = 100, c = 0.3?
a) 1.51 m
b) 2.51 m
c) 2.15 m
d) 1.15 m
d
                                     V = k s  \(\frac{sin2θ}{2}\) + c sin θ
S = 2.34 – 1.77 = 0.57m
On substitution,
V = (100*0.57*sin(2*109ꞌ))/2 + (0.3*sin(109ꞌ))
V = 1.15m.
8. What is the value of additive constant in anallactic lens?
a) 100
b) 0.3
c) 0
d) 0.4
c
9. From the figure, the R.L of B can be____________
a) R.L of B = R.L of B.M + H.I + X + V
b) R.L = R.L of B.M + H.I + V – X
c) R.L = R.L of B.M + V – X
d) R.L = R.L of B.M + V + X
b
10. Subtense method is one of the classifications of stadia system.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Calculate the value of K and C, if the measurements are taken between two points of 50 and 130 distant apart and the stadia readings will be 0.024, 0.824 respectively.
a) 0, 47.6
b) 47.6, 100
c) 100, 47.6
d) 47.6, 0
c
80 = k(0.8). We get, K = 100. Now, substitute this value in any of the equations to get the value of C. It can be given as 50 = 100*0.024 + C, C = 47.6.
12. The following are the staff readings given when the staff is held normal. The line of sight of instrument is placed at an angle +3024ꞌ. It being an anallactic lens, find the horizontal distance between staff and instrument station. Staff readings – 2.145 m, 1.925 m, 1.464 m.
a) 62.082 m
b) 58.082 m
c) 60.082 m
d) 68.082 m
d
D = 100*0.681* cos 3024ꞌ + 0 + 1.925* sin 3024ꞌ
D = 68.082 m.
13. Calculate the value of R.L for staff being vertical and possessing staff readings as follows 2.892, 2.234, 1.926. It being an anallactic lens possesses an instrumental height of 1.94 with R.L 102.34 m. Line of sight placed at an angle of 2042ꞌ.
a) 106.591 m
b) 105.591 m
c) 109.951 m
d) 100.981 m
a
V = 100 * (2.892-1.926)/2* sin (2*2042ꞌ) + 0
V = 4.545 m. R.L of staff is given as R.L = 102.34 + 1.94 + 4.545 – 2.234 = 106.591 m.
