1. From the figure, X indicates________
a) Tilted photograph
b) Vertical photograph
c) Oblique photograph
d) Terminated photograph
a
2. Determine the tilt displacement if the values of point of rotation and a are 3 and 4m having tilt angle 43˚23ꞌ with focal length 4m.
a) 4.72m
b) 42.72m
c) 24.27m
d) 24.72m
d
d = (i*a)2*sin t / f. On substitution, we get
d = (3*4)2*sin 43˚23ꞌ / 4
d = 24.72m.
3. Distance from isocentre is taken into consideration in tilt displacement.
a) False
b) True
b
4. Relief distortion depends on which of the following?
a) Zenith
b) Flying height
c) Datum
d) Focal length
b
5. The formula for tilt displacement can be given as ___________
a) d = (i+a)2*sin t / f
b) d = (i-a)2*sin t / f
c) d = (i*a)2*sin t / f
d) d = (i*a)2*sin t + f
c
d = (i*a)2*sin t / f.
6. The formula of relief displacement can be given as __________
a) d = r*h / H
b) d = r+h / H
c) d = r*h * H
d) d = r-h / H
a
d = r*h / H.
7. What is the position of relief displacement on vertical photograph?
a) Horizontal
b) Parallel
c) Perpendicular
d) Radial
d
8. Flying height is used in case of tilted photograph.
a) False
b) True
b
9. Tilt displacement of a point on nadir point is _________
a) Half inward
b) Completely  outward
c) Half outward
d) Completely inward
c
10. Determine the relief displacement if the radial distance is given as 45m with a height from mean sea level and height of the station is given as 2m and 76m respectively.
a) 1.18m
b) 1.81m
c) 9.18m
d) 10.18m
a
d = r*h / H. On substitution, we get
d = 45*2 / 76
d = 1.18m.
