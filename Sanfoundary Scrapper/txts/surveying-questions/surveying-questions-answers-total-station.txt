6. Which of the following indicates the correct set of the combination of total station?
a) Theodolite, compass
b) Theodolite, EDM
c) Electronic theodolite, EDM
d) EDM, GPS
c
7. Which among the following doesn’t indicate the basic calculation of the total station?
a) Horizontal distance
b) Slope distance
c) Vertical distance
d) Co-ordinate calculations
b
8. The formula for difference in elevation can be given as__________
a) D = V + (I-R)
b) D = V + (I+R)
c) D = V – (I-R)
d) D = V * (I-R)
a
9. In which direction it is best to place the total station for obtaining the best output?
a) East
b) West
c) South
d) North
d
10. The data obtained from total station can be used in which among the following software directly?
a) Primavera
b) STAAD PRO
c) Autodesk Revit
d) Surfer
d
11. Calculation the elevation difference if the vertical distance is 14.89m, instrument height is 9.2m, ground is at 2.8m.
a) 21.29 m
b) 12.29 m
c) 21.92 m
d) 41.29 m
a
dz = Vd + (Ih-Rh). On substitution, we get
dz = 14.89 + (9.2-2.8)
dz = 21.29 m.
12. Find the vertical distance if the value of slope distance can be given as 12.98 and the angle is 1˚23ꞌ.
a) 21.97m
b) 12.97m
c) 12.79m
d) 21.79m
b
Vd = Sd*cosZa = 12.98*cos (1˚23ꞌ)  Vd = 12.97m.
13. Find the elevation of ground beneath the reflector, if the known elevation of instrument is 12.76m, slope distance = 3.76m, angle is about 3˚43ꞌ, instrument height = 2.93m, ground is at 0.987 m.
a) 18.54m
b) 81.54m
c) 18.45m
d) 18.97m
c
Rz = Iz + Sd * cosZa + Ih – Rh. On substitution, we get
Rz = 12.76 + (3.76*cos (3˚43ꞌ)) + 2.93 – 0.987
Rz = 18.45 m.
