1. The trapezoidal formula can be applied only if __________
a) It composes prism and wedges
b) It composes triangles and parallelograms
c) It composes prism and parallelograms
d) It composes triangles and wedges
a
2. Trapezoidal formula is also known as ____________
a) Simpson’s rule
b) Co-ordinate method
c) Prismoidal method
d) Average end area method
d
3. Which of the following indicates the assumption assumed in the trapezoidal formula?
a) mid-area is the mean of the starting area
b) mid-area is the mean of the end area
c) mid-area is the mean
d) mid-area is not the mean of the end area
b
4. Prismoidal correction can be applied to the trapezoidal formula.
a) True
b) False
a
5. Calculate the volume of third section, if the areas are 76.32 sq. m and 24.56 sq. m with are at a distance of 4 m.
a) 210.11 cu. m
b) 201.67 cu. m
c) 201.76 cu. m
d) 210.76 cu. m
c
V = d/2 (A3 + A4). On substitution, we get
V = 4/2 (76.32 + 24.56)
V = 201.76 cu. m.

6. If the areas of the two sides of a prismoid represent 211.76 sq. m and 134.67 sq. m, which are 2 m distant apart, find the total volume using trapezoidal formula. Consider n=3.
a) 651.99 cu. m
b) 615.99 cu. m
c) 651.77 cu. m
d) 615.77 cu. m
d
V = d ((A1 + A2/2) + A2). On substitution, we get
V = 2 ((211.76 + 134.67/2) + 134.67)
V = 615.77 cu. m.
7. In trapezoidal formula, volume can be over estimated.
a) False
b) True
b
8. Determine the volume of prismoid using trapezoidal formula, if the areas are given as 117.89 sq. m and 55.76 sq. m which are 1.5m distant apart.
a) 130.23 cu. m
b) 103.23 cu. m
c) 13.44 cu. m
d) 103.65 cu. m
a
V = d/2 (A1 + A2). On substitution, we get
V = 1.5/2 (117.89 + 55.76)
V = 130.23 cu. m.
9. Which of the following methods is capable of providing sufficient accuracy?
a) Area by planimeter
b) Area by co-ordinates
c) Prismoidal method
d) Trapezoidal method
d
10. The correction applied in trapezoidal formula is equal to____________
a) Product of calculated volume and obtained volume
b) Summation between calculated volume and obtained volume
c) Difference between calculated volume and obtained volume
d) Division of calculated volume and obtained volume
c
