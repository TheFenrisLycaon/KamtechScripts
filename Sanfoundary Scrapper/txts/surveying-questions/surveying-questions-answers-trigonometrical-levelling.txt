1. While taking Observations for the height and distances, which method of surveying is used?
a) Chain surveying
b) Compass surveying
c) Plane surveying
d) Geodic surveying
c
2. From the figure, the value of D can be given as_____________
a) D = (b tan α1) / (tan α1 – tan α2)
b) D = (b tan α2) / (tan α2 – tan α1)
c) D = (b tan α1) / (tan α2 – tan α1)
d) D = (b tan α2) / (tan α1 – tan α2)
b
By equating we get,
D tan α1 = (b + D) tan α2
D = (b tan α2) / (tan α2 – tan α1).
3. The correction for curvature and refraction is applied when the points are having small distance between them.
a) True
b) False
b
C= 0.06728D*D
Where, D is the horizontal distance between the given two points in Kilometres.
4. Which of the following indicates the value of D, when base of object is accessible?
a) D = s / tan α
b) D = tan α / s
c) D = tan α / h
d) D = h / tan α
d
h = D tan α and D = h / tan α.
5. From the figure, determine the value of s
a) S = D tanα1 – b tanα2 – D tanα2
b) S = D tanα2 – b tanα2 – D tanα2
c) S = D tanα1 – b tanα1 – D tanα2
d) S = D tanα1 – b tanα2 – D tanα1
a
Subtracting, we get h1 – h2 = D tanα1 – b tanα2 – D tanα2
h1 – h2 = s, so we get s = D tanα1 – b tanα2 – D tanα2.

6. Which of the following is not a case in trigonometric levelling?
a) Base of object is accessible
b) Base of object is inaccessible
c) Base of object is at accurate position
d) Base of object is inaccessible, station is not in vertical plane
c
Case 1: Base of the object accessible.
Case 2: Base of the object inaccessible – Instrument stations in the same vertical plane as the elevated object.
Case 3: Base of the object inaccessible – Instrument stations not in the same vertical plane as the elevated object.
7. Among the following, which represents the method of observation?
a) Indirect method
b) Reciprocal method
c) Recurring method
d) Transit method
b
8. In which of the following cases, two instrument stations are used?
a) Base of the object is at infinity
b) Base of the object is at accurate position
c) Base of the object is accessible
d) Base of the object is inaccessible
d
9. From the figure, determine R.L of Q from A?
a) R.L = R.L of A + h + H2
b) R.L = R.L of A + s + H1
c) R.L = R.L of A + s + H2
d) R.L = R.L of B + H1 + h
b
R.L = R.L of A + s + H1
Where, s = H2- H1.
10. In Geodic surveying, correction for curvature and refraction are neglected.
a) True
b) False
b
11. Calculate the R.L of B, if D = 24.96 m, angle for line of sight is +4024ꞌ, height of the axis will be 1.29 m and the R.L of A is 400 m.
a) 403.21 m
b) 430.21 m
c) 403.12 m
d) 401.32 m
a
Now, R.L = 400 + 1.29 + 1.921 = 403.21 m.
12. From the figure, find the horizontal distance between the station and staff and consider distance between stations will be 2 m.
a) 1.6 m
b) 1.4 m
c) 1.2 m
d) 1.8 m
d
13. By using the data provided from the figure, find the value of h1. Where α1 = 9024ꞌ, α2 = 4044ꞌ, b = 1.2 m, s = 1.295 m.
a) 2.66 m
b) 2.86 m
c) 2.79 m
d) 2.97 m
c
h1 = (s + b*tanα2)*tanα1 / (tanα1 – tanα2). By substituting the required values we get, h1 = (1.295 + 1.2 * tan4044ꞌ) / (tan9024ꞌ – tan4044ꞌ) = 2.79 m.
14. If the value of D = 2000m, what would be correction for curvature?
a) 0.629 sq. m
b) 0.269 sq. m
c) 0.962 sq. m
d) 0.692 sq. m
b
