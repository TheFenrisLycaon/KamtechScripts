1. Which of the following indicates the formula for linear method of bisection of arcs?
a) \( R + (R^2 – (\frac{l}{2})^2)^{1/2}\) 
b) \( R * (R^2 – (\frac{l}{2})^2)^{1/2}\) 
c) \( R – (R^2 + (\frac{l}{2})^2)^{1/2}\) 
d) \( R – (R^2 – (\frac{l}{2})^2)^{1/2}\) 
d
2. Find the perpendicular distance if the radius of the curve is given as 10.26m and the angle as θ = 10˚24ꞌ.
a) 0.042m
b) 0.402m
c) 0.204m
d) 0.024m
a
10.26*(1- cos (10˚24ꞌ/2)) = 0.042 m.
3. The bisection of chords method involves more accuracy.
a) False
b) True
b
4. Set a perpendicular offset for A and B using the radius and the angle given. R = 34.76m and θ = 14˚76ꞌ.
a) 2.08m
b) 0.82m
c) 0.28m
d) 8.02m
c
34.76*(1-cos (14˚76ꞌ/4)) = 0.28 m.
