a) 179˚24ꞌ
b) 173˚4ꞌ
c) 73˚24ꞌ
d) 173˚24ꞌ
d
δ = 1718.9*C / R. On substitution, we get
δ = 1718.9*4/ 39.65
δ = 173˚24ꞌ.
10. Rankine’s method is also known as____________
a) Deflection distances method
b) Deflection angles method
c) Tacheometric method
d) Arc bisection method
b
11. If the degree of the curve is equal to D at 20m chord, find the tangential angle with length of the chord being 5.6m.
a) 2˚28ꞌ
b) 12˚28ꞌ
c) 2˚12ꞌ
d) 22˚28ꞌ
a
δ = c*D/40. On substitution, we get
δ = 5.6*20/40
δ = 2˚28ꞌ.
12. Which of the following describes the advantage of Rankine’s method?
a) Curve can be set only at P.T
b) Curve can be set only at P.C
c) Curve can be set in multiple operations
d) Curve can be set in one operation
d
13. Find the deflection angle for various points if the value of θ is given as 24˚ and Δ = 48˚.
a) 54˚40ꞌ
b) 45˚48ꞌ
c) 45˚40ꞌ
d) 50˚40ꞌ
c
Tan α = (1-cos θ) / (tan Δ/2-sin θ). On substitution, we get
Tan α = (1-cos 52˚) / (tan (48˚/2)-sin 4˚)
 α = 45˚40ꞌ.
14. Find the tangential angle of the curve, if the length of the chord is given as 65m and the degree of the curve is equal to D at 100ft length.
a) 32˚38ꞌ
b) 32˚30ꞌ
c) 23˚30ꞌ
d) 2˚30ꞌ
b
δ = c*D/200. On substitution, we get
δ = 65*100/200
δ = 32˚30ꞌ.
15. Find the chord length using Rankine’s method with radius of the curve being 43.76m and the tangential angle is 87˚45ꞌ.
a) 2.23m
b) 3.22m
c) 3.98m
d) 5.43m
a
δ = 1718.9*C / R. On substitution, we get
87˚45ꞌ = 1718.9*C / 43.76
C = 2.23 m.
