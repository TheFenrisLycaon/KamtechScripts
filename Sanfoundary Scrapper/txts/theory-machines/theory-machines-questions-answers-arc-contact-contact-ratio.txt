a) 4.2
b) 1.9
c) 3.7
d) 2.8
d
Contact ratio = Arc of contact/ Circular pitch = Arc of contact / πm = 70.71/(πx8) = 2.8.
10. The path of approach = 13.92 mm and path of recess = 11.56 mm. The pressure angle is 22.5°. The module is 4 mm. Find the contact ratio of these two gears.
a) 2.19
b) 3.54
c) 3.12
d) 2.53
a
Arc of contact = Path of contact/cos φ = 25.48/cos 22.5° = 27.58 mm
Contact ratio = Arc of contact/ Circular pitch = Arc of contact / πm = 27.58/(πx4) = 2.19.
11. Two involute gears in a mesh have a module of 10 mm and the pressure angle is 35°. The larger gear has 45 teeth whereas the pinion has 15 teeth. The addendum is equal to one module. Find the arc of contact.
a) 36. 832 mm
b) 32.460 mm
c) 39.626 mm
d) 27.239 mm
c
r = mt/2 = 75 mm, R = mT/2 = 225 mm
ra = r + a = 85 mm, Ra = R + a = 235 mm
Path of contact = (Ra2 – R2cos2 φ)0.5 + (ra2 – r2cos2 φ)0.5 – (R + r)sinφ = 32.46 mm
Arc of contact = Path of contact/cos φ = 32.46/cos 35° = 39.626 mm.
12. The pressure angle of two gears in a mesh is φ = 22.5°. The number of teeth on the pinion is 25 and the gear ratio is 2. The module is 7 mm and addendum = 1 module. Find the angle of action of these two gears.
a) 32.056°
b) 34.697°
c) 22.72°
d) 28.531°
c
r = mt/2 = 87.5 mm and ra = r + a = 94.5 mm
R = mT/2 = 175 mm and Ra = R + a = 182 mm
Path of contact = (Ra2 – R2cos2 φ)0.5 + (ra2 – r2cos2 φ)0.5 – (R + r)sinφ = 32.056 mm
Arc of contact = Path of contact/cos φ = 32.056/cos 22.5° = 34.697 mm.
Angle of action = Arc of contact / r = 0.3965 rad = 22.72°.
13. The pressure angle of two gears in a mesh is φ = 25°. The number of teeth on the pinion is 45 and the gear ratio is 2. The module is 6 mm and addendum = 1.1 module. Find the contact ratio of these two gears.
a) 1.7
b) 2.3
c) 4.2
d) 3.5
a
r = mt/2 = 135 mm and ra = r + a = 141.6 mm
R = mT/2 = 270 mm and Ra = R + a = 276.6 mm
Path of contact = (Ra2 – R2cos2 φ)0.5 + (ra2 – r2cos2 φ)0.5 – (R + r)sinφ = 29.068 mm
Arc of contact = Path of contact/cos φ = 29.068/cos 25° = 32.073 mm.
Contact ratio = Arc of contact / Circular pitch = 32.073 / πm = 32.073 / (πx6) = 1.7.
