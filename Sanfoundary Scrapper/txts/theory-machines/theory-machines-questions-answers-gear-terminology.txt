1. The smaller and generally the driving gear of a pair of mated gears is called _________
a) pitch
b) module
c) rack
d) pinion
d
2. The distance measured along the circumference of the pitch circle from a point on one tooth to the same point on the adjacent tooth is called ________________
a) pitch diameter
b) circular pitch
c) pitch point
d) line of centres
b
p = d π/ N; where, p is the circular pitch, d is the standard pitch diameter and N is the number of teeth.
3. The number of teeth per unit length of the pitch circle diameter is called ________________
a) diametral pitch
b) module
c) clearance
d) gear ratio
a
It is used to classify different types and sizes of gears. It is a function of the pitch circle.
P = T/d.
4. The ratio of the number of teeth on the gear to the number of teeth on the pinion is called ______
a) velocity ratio
b) module
c) gear ratio
d) pitch point
c
Gear ratio is inversely proportional to the radius of the pitch circle and also the number of teeth on the driving gear.
5. The ratio of pitch diameter to the number of teeth is called _________
a) module
b) addendum
c) dedendum
d) backlash
a
Module indicates the size of the gear and classifies whether the gear is big or small as module is a unit of size.
m = d/T or m = p/π.
