1. What is the condition involved in Grashof’s law?
a) s+l≥p+q
b) s-l ≥ p-q
c) s+l≤p+q
d) s-l ≤ p-q
c
Therefore, s+l≤p+q.
2. If Grashof’s law is not satisfied, no link will make a complete revolution relative to one another. True or False?
a) False
b) True
b
3. If the link next to the shortest link is fixed, what type of mechanism is obtained?
a) Double crank mechanism
b) Linkage is not planar
c) Double rocker mechanism
d) Crank rocker mechanism
d
4. If the shortest link is fixed, what type of mechanism is obtained?
a) Double crank mechanism
b) Double rocker mechanism
c) Linkage is not planar
d) Crank rocker mechanism
a
5. If the link opposite to the shortest link is fixed, what type of mechanism is obtained?
a) Double crank mechanism
b)Linkage is not planar
c) Double rocker mechanism
d) Crank rocker mechanism
c
Thus, this mechanism is called as double rocker mechanism.
6. If the s+l=p+q, what is the type of linkage?
a) Trapezium
b) Parallelogram
c) Circular
d) Six bar
b
7. What type of mechanism is shown in the given diagram?
a) Double crank mechanism
b) Linkage is not planar
c) Double rocker mechanism
d) Crank rocker mechanism
d
8. What type of mechanism is shown in the diagram below?
a) Double rocker mechanism
b) Crank rocker mechanism
c) Double crank mechanism
d) Linkage is not planar
b
9. What type of mechanism is shown in the diagram given below?
a) Double crank mechanism
b) Crank rocker mechanism
c) Double rocker mechanism
d) Linkage is not planar
a
10. What type of mechanism is shown in the diagram given below?
a) Crank rocker mechanism
b) Double crank mechanism
c) Double rocker mechanism
d) Linkage is not planar
b
11. What type of mechanism is shown in the diagram given below?
a) Double rocker mechanism
b) Double crank mechanism
c) Crank rocker mechanism
d) Linkage is not planar
c
12. What type of mechanism is shown in the diagram given below?
a) Double rocker mechanism
b) Double crank mechanism
c) Crank rocker mechanism
d) Linkage is not planar
c
13. What type of mechanism is shown in the diagram given below?
a) Double rocker mechanism
b) Double crank mechanism
c) Crank rocker mechanism
d) Linkage is not planar
d
14. What type of mechanism is shown in the diagram given below?
a) Double rocker mechanism
b) Double crank mechanism
c) Crank rocker mechanism
d) Linkage is not planar
a
Here, the link opposite to the shortest side is fixed. Thus, the mechanism obtained is double rocker mechanism.
15. What type of mechanism is shown in the diagram given below?
a) Double rocker mechanism
b) Linkage is not planar
c) Crank rocker mechanism
d) Double crank mechanism
b
