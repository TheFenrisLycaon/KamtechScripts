1. For what purpose are the quick return mechanisms used?
a) To convert reciprocating motion into oscillatory motion
b) To convert oscillatory motion into reciprocating motion
c) To convert reciprocating motion into rotary motion
d) To convert rotary motion into reciprocating motion
d
2. In a quick return mechanism, the forward reciprocating motion is faster rate than the backward stroke. True or false?
a) True
b) False
b
Thus, the statement is false.
3. For a crank and slotted lever quick return mechanism, α = 150°. Find the ratio of time of cutting stroke to time of return stroke.
a) 1.2
b) 1.3
c) 1.4
d) 1.5
c
4. For a crank and slotted lever quick return mechanism,β = 260°. Find the ratio of time of cutting stroke to time of quick return stroke.
a) 2.6
b) 1.6
c) 0.2
d) 0.4
a
5. For a Whitworth quick return motion mechanism α = 200°. Find the ratio of time of cutting stroke to time of return stroke.
a) 1.25
b) 1.35
c) 1.30
d) 1.40
a
6. For a Whitworth quick return motion mechanism β = 110°. Find the ratio of time of cutting stroke to time of return stroke.
a) 0.44
b) 2.27
c) 2.37
d) 0.42
b
7. A crank and slotted lever quick return mechanism has a centre distance of 1000 mm between the centre of oscillation of slotted lever and centre of rotation of the crank. Radius of the crank is 420 mm. Find the ratio of time of cutting stroke to time of return stroke.
a) 1.677
b) 6.901
c) 6.248
d) 1.762
d
sin(90-α/2) = BC/AC = 0.42
90- α/2 = 24.834
α = 130.33°
Ratio of time of cutting stroke to time of return stroke = (360-α)/α = (360-130.33)/130.33
= 1.762.
8. In a crank and slotted lever quick return mechanism, the distance between the fixed centres is 400 mm and the length of the crank is 250 mm. If the length of the slotted bar is 2000 mm, find the length of the stroke if the line of stroke passes through the extreme positions of the free side of the lever.
a) 1500 mm
b) 2000 mm
c) 1000 mm
d) 2500 mm
d
sin(90- α/2) = BC/AC = 0.625
α = 102.63°
Length of stroke = 2 x AB sin(38.68°) = 2500 mm.
9. In a Whitworth quick return mechanism, distance between the fixed centres is 30mm and the length of the driving crank is 60 mm. The length of the slotted lever is 100 mm and the length of the connecting rod is 85 mm. Find the ratio of time of cutting stroke to time of return stroke.
a) 1.5
b) 2.5
c) 2
d) 1
c
cos β/2 = 0.5
β = 120°
Ratio of time of cutting stroke to time of return stroke = (360-β)/ β = (360-120)/120 = 2.
