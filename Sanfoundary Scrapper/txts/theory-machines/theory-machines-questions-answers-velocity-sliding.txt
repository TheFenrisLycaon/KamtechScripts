b) 902.93 mm/s
c) 394.02 mm/s
d) 680.58 mm/s
d
Ng = 30 rpm. Therefore, ωg= 3.14 rad/s
Path of approach = Path of contact – Path of recess = 100 mm – 50 mm = 50 mm.
Velocity of sliding = (ωp + ωg) x Path of approach = (10.47 + 3.14) x 50 = 680.58 mm/s.
6. The angular velocity of the pinion is 200 rpm and that of the gear is 50 rpm. The maximum addendum radius of the larger wheel is 85 mm and the radius of the gear is equal to 75 mm. The pressure angle between the gears is equal to 30°. Find the velocity of sliding at the beginning of the contact.
a) 1289.129 mm/s
b) 732.324 mm/s
c) 453.681  mm/s
d) 239.238 mm/s
c
Ng = 50 rpm. Therefore,  ωg= 5.236 rad/s
Ra = 85 mm and R = 75 mm; φ = 30°
Path of approach = (Ra2 – R2cos2 φ)0.5 – Rsinφ = 17.33 mm
Velocity of sliding = (ωp + ωg) x Path of approach = (20.944 + 5.236) x 17.33 = 453.68 mm/s.
7. The angular velocity of the pinion is 325 rpm and that of the gear is 155 rpm. The number of teeth on the larger wheel is 60 and the module is equal to 7 mm. Addendum is 1.1 times the module. The pressure angle is 20°. Find the velocity of sliding at the beginning of the contact.
a) 1010.858 mm/s
b) 1317.858 mm/s
c) 1217.858 mm/s
d) 1117.858 mm/s
a
Ng = 155 rpm. Therefore, ωg= 16.231 rad/s
m = 7 mm, T = 60 mm and R = mT/2 = 210 mm
Ra = R + a = 210 + 7.7 = 217.7 mm
Path of approach= (Ra2 – R2cos2 φ)0.5 – Rsinφ = 20.11 mm
Velocity of sliding = (ωp + ωg) x Path of recess = (34.034 + 16.231) x 20.11 = 1010.858 mm/s.
8. The angular velocity of the pinion is 75 rpm and that of the gear is 25 rpm. The addendum radius is 45 mm for the pinion and the radius of the pinion is 40 mm. The pressure angle between the gears is 25°. Find the velocity of sliding at the end of the contact.
a) 89.92 mm/s
b) 91.01 mm/s
c) 94.29 mm/s
d) 97.77 mm/s
d
Ng = 25 rpm. Therefore,  ωg= 2.168 rad/s
r = 40 mm, ra = 45 mm, φ = 25°
Path of recess = (ra2 – r2cos2 φ)0.5 – rsinφ = 9.755 mm
Velocity of sliding = (ωp + ωg) x Path of recess = (7.854 + 2.168) x 9.755 = 97.77 mm/s.
9. The angular velocity of the pinion is 150 rpm and that of the gear is 75 rpm. The number of teeth on the pinion is equal to 20 and the module = 6 mm. The value of addendum is equal to 1 module.

a) 591.29 mm/s
b) 601.12 mm/s
c) 324.87mm/s
d) 512.02 mm/s
c
Ng = 75 rpm. Therefore, ωg= 7.854 rad/s
t = 20 and m = 6 mm.
r = mt/2 = 60 mm and ra = r + a = 66 mm; φ = 20°
Path of recess = (ra2 – r2cos2 φ)0.5 – rsinφ = 13.79 mm
Velocity of sliding = (ωp + ωg) x Path of recess = (15.708 + 7.854) x 13.79 = 324.87 mm/s.
10. What is the formula for rolling velocity?
a) ωp x r
b) ωg x R
c) 0
d) ωg x r
a
11. Two involute gears in a mesh have path of approach = 29.83 mm and path of recess = 21.09 mm. The larger gear has 40 teeth and the pinion has 12 teeth.  Find the ratio of the sliding to rolling velocity at the:
i) beginning of contact

ii) Ratio of the sliding to rolling velocity = ((ωp + ωg) x Path of recess)/ ωpx r = (ωp+ (12/40)ωp) x 21.09/(ωp x 72) = 0.38
iii) Ratio of the sliding to rolling velocity = ((ωp + ωg) x 0)/ ωpx r = 0.
