1. When large gear reductions are needed _________ gears are used.
a) helical
b) spur
c) worm
d) bevel
c
2. The driven gear in the worm gear is a helical gear. True or false?
a) True
b) False
a
3. Which is of these is an advantage of worm gear?
a) It is expensive
b) Has high power losses and low transmission efficiency
c) Produce a lot of heat
d) Used for reducing speed and increasing torque
d
4. The distance between corresponding points on adjacent teeth measured along the direction of the axis is called ____________
a) joint line
b) normal link
c) axial pitch
d) lead
c
5. The distance by which a helix advances along the axis of the gear for one turn around is called _____________
a) joint line
b) normal link
c) axial pitch
d) lead
d
6. The angle at which the teeth are inclined to the normal of the axis of rotation is called _______________
a) pitch angle
b) lead angle
c) normal angle
d) joint angle
b
7. What is the velocity ratio of worm gears?
a) (lπ)/d2
b) (πd2)/l
c) l/(πd2)
d) d2/(lπ)
c
Thus, velocity ratio = (2l/d2)/(2π) = l/(πd2).
8. What is the centre distance for the worm gear?
a) (mn/2)(T1 cotλ1 – T2)
b) (mn/2)(T2 cotλ1 + T1)
c) (mn/2)(T2 cotλ1 – T1)
d) (mn/2)(T1 cotλ1 + T2)
d
This equation can be derived by using the formula for centre distance of a helical gear which is given as C = (mn/2) ((T1/cos Ψ1) + (T2/cos Ψ2)
As, Ψ2 = λ1, Ψ1 = 90° – λ1.
9. What is the formula to calculate maximum efficiency of a worm gear?
a) (1+sinø)/(1-sinø)
b) (1-sinø)/(1+sinø)
c) (tan(λ1-ø))/tan λ1
d) (tan(λ1+ø))/tan λ1
b
10. Find the helix angle of the worm if the pitch of the worm gear is 12 mm and the pitch diameter is 50 mm.
a) 8.687°
b) 11.231°
c) 9.212°
d) 10.319°
a
λ1 = 8.687°.
11. Find the speed of the gear if the worm is a three start worm rotating at 500 rpm. The gear has 20 teeth.
a) 125 rpm
b) 100 rpm
c) 75 rpm
d) 50 rpm
c
500/N2 = 20/3
N2 = 75 rpm
Thus, the gear rotates at a speed of 75 rpm.
12. For a two start worm gear having a pitch of 20 mm and a lead angle 12°, find the centre distance if the larger gear has 25 teeth.
a) 148.22 mm
b) 124.93 mm
c) 121.19 mm
d) 109.53 mm
d
Therefore, C = (pn/2π)(T1 cotλ1 + T2) = 109.53 mm.
13. Calculate the lead angle of the worm gear for maximum efficiency if θ = 90° and the coefficient of friction is 0.05.
a) 48.21°
b) 42.23°
c) 43.57°
d) 46.43°
c
For maximum efficiency, Ψ1 = (θ+ ø)/2 = 92.862/2 = 46.43°
Ψ1 = 90° – λ1 = 46.43°
λ1 = 90° – 46.43° = 43.57°.
14. Find the maximum efficiency if the lead angle is given to be 10° and the coefficient of friction is 0.07.
a) 79.82%
b) 72.23%
c) 76.29%
d) 70.72%
d
Efficiency = tan(λ1)/ tan(λ1+ ø) = 0.7072 = 70.72%.
15. Calculate the maximum efficiency of the worm gears which have a friction angle of 0.06.
a) 88.71%
b) 83.23%
c) 89.91%
d) 86.49%
a
Maximum efficiency = (1-sin ø)/(1+sin ø) = 0.8871 = 88.71%.
