1. What is the equivalent emissivity for radiant heat exchange between a small body (emissivity = 0.4) in a very large enclosure (emissivity = 0.5)?
a) 0.5
b) 0.4
c) 0.2
d) 0.1
b
ε=\(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{ε1}+A1/A2(\frac{1}{ε2}-1)} \) 
Since, A1/A2 is very less whole term is neglected.
ε = 0.4.
2. If a body is at 2000K, the wavelength at which the body emits maximum amount of radiation is __________
a) 1.45µm
b) 1.45cm
c) 0.345cm
d) 0.345µm
a
λmax T = 2898µmk
λmax ×2000 = 2898µmk
λmax = 1.45µm.
3. Which of the following parameter is not responsible for loss of heat from a hot surface in room?
a) Temperature of the surface
b) Emissivity of the surface
c) Temperature of the air in the room
d) Dimensions of the room
d
Q = ∈σ(T14-T24)
And A=πDL
Hence heat transfer will depend upon temperature of the surface and surrounding, surface Emissivity and length and diameter of the pipe.
4. Hot coffee in a cup is allowed to cool. Its cooling rate is measured and found to be greater than the value calculated by conduction, convection and radiation measurement. The difference is due to:
a) Properties of coffee changing with temperature
b) Currents of air flow in the room
c) Underestimation of the emissivity of coffee
d) Evaporation
