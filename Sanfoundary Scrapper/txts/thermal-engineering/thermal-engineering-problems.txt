1. Dalton’s law of partial pressure states that the total pressure exerted by a mixture of gas and vapour is the sum of partial pressure of the gas and partial pressure of the vapour at the common temperature.
a) True
b) False
a
	Therefore, at a particular temperature ‘t’ –
	Mathematically,
		P = Pa + Ps
	Where, P = Total pressure inside the container
		Pa = Partial pressure of the gas (at temperature t)
		Ps = Saturation pressure of water at temperature t
2. Which of the following expression is the correct one for calculating total mass of mixture present in a container? (In terms of mass of vapour)
a) ms \(\{1-\frac{v_g}{v_a}\}\) 
b) ms \(\{1+\frac{v_g}{v_a}\}\) 
c) ms \(\{1-\frac{v_a}{v_g}\}\) 
d) ms \(\{1+\frac{v_a}{v_g}\}\) 
b
where, ms = Mass of vapour inside the container
vg = Specific volume of saturated water vapour
va = Specific volume of air
vg and va at a particular temperature ‘t’.
3. Which of the following expression is the correct one for calculating total mass of mixture present in a container? (In terms of mass of air)
a) ma\(\{1+\frac{v_g}{v_a}\}\) 
b) ma\(\{1-\frac{v_g}{v_a}\}\) 
c) ma\(\{1+\frac{v_a}{v_g}\}\) 
d) ma\(\{1-\frac{v_a}{v_g}\}\) 
c
where, ma = Mass of air inside the container
vg  = Specific volume of saturated water vapour
va = Specific volume of air
vg  and va at a particular temperature ‘t’.
4. Given specific volume of steam as 54.25 m3/kg and volume of the container as 190 m3, calculate the mass of steam present inside the container.
a) 3.0 kg
b) 3.5 kg
c) 4.0 kg
d) 4.5 kg
b
Mass of steam = \(\frac{V}{v} = \frac{190}{54.25}\) = 3.5 kg.
5. In a conatainer, having a mixture of steam and air, the specific volumes of air and steam are 42 m3/kg and 55 m3/kg. Calculate the total mass of the mixture present inside the container if the mass of steam inside the container is 4.23 kg.
a) 9.77 kg
b) 10.23 kg
c) 12.85 kg
d) 15.64 kg
a
We know that,
Total mass of mixtue = ms\(\{1+\frac{v_g}{v_a}\}\) = 4.23\(\{1+\frac{55}{42}\}\) = 9.77 kg.
