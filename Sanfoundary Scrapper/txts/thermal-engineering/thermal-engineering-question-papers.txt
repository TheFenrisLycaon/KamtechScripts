1. The actual indicator diagram is different from the hypothetical one due to _____
a) timings of the valve action and pressure drop due to friction in the admission port
b) limited amount of steam
c) Excess amount of steam
d) Low quality valves installation
a
2. The rounding observed in the actual indicator diagram is due to valve action.
a) True
b) False
a
3. What is diagram factor?
a) It is the ratio of the area of theoretical indicator diagram and the area of the actual indicator diagram
b) It is the ratio of area of the actual indicator diagram and the area of the theoretical indicator diagram
c) It is the sum of areas of actual and theoretical indicator diagram
d) It is the ratio of the difference between the areas of the theoretical and actual indicator diagram and the theoretical indicator diagram.
b
Diagram factor  = \(\frac{Area \, of \, actual \, indicator \, diagram}{Area \, of \, theoretical \, indicator \,  diagram} \) 
4. Given that the diagram factor for a particular reciprocating steam engine is 0.70 and the theoretically plotted indicator diagram has an area of 1700 kJ. Determine the area of the actual indicator diagram for the steam engine.
a) 11700 kJ
b) 11800 kJ
c) 11900 kJ
d) 12000 kJ
c
	We knew that,
Diagram factor  = \(\frac{Area \, of \, actual \, indicator \, diagram}{Area \, of \, theoretical \, indicator \,  diagram} \) 
	Substituting the values, we get
			0.7 = \(\frac{Area \, of \, actual \, indicator \, diagram}{1700} \) 
	Therefore,
		Area of the actual indicator diagram = 11900 kJ.
5. The actual expansion of the steam is not isentropic due to _____
a) leakage of heat through cylinder walls
b) limited amount of steam
c) No heat leakage
d) boiler inefficiency
a
6. Calculate the diagram factor if the areas of theoretical and actual and theoretical indicator diagrams are 1400 kJ and 1800 kJ respectively.
a) 0.51
b) 0.52
c) 0.68
d) 0.78
d
	We know that,
Diagram factor  = \(\frac{Area \, of \, actual \, indicator \, diagram}{Area \, of \, theoretical \, indicator \,  diagram} \) 
	Substituting the values, we get
		Diagram factor  = \(\frac{1400}{1800} \) 
	Therefore,
		Diagram factor = 0.78.
