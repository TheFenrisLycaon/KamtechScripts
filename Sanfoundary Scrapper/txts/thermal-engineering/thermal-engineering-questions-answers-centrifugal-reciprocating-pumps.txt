b) Refrigerator
c) Heat engine
d) Turbine
a
2. Which of the following is a positive displacement pump?
a) Centrifugal pump
b) Diffuser pump
c) Axial pump
d) Reciprocating pump
d
3. Which of the following is a dynamic pump?
a) Centrifugal pump
b) Rotary pump
c) Multiple rotor
d) Reciprocating pump
a
4. Dynamic pumps are also known as ______
a) Positive displacement pumps

6. The rise in pressure head at any point of the impeller is proportional to ______
a) \(\frac{u^3}{2g} \) 
b) \(\frac{u^2}{2g} \) 
c) \(\frac{u^3}{3g} \) 
d) \(\frac{u^2}{g} \) 
b
Here, u1 = 0 and ∆z = 0
\(\frac{∆p}{ρ} = \frac{u^2}{2g} \) 
7. Which of the following is not an advantage of centrifugal pump?
a) Low initial cost
b) High efficiency
c) Difficult installation
d) Easy maintenance
c
Low initial cost 
	Easy maintenance 
	Easy installation
	High efficiency
	Uniform and continuous discharge
8. When the speed of the centrifugal pump is doubled, the power required to drive the pump will be _____
a) Increase 8 times
b) Increase 4 times
c) Double
d) Remain the same
a
9. Why an air vessel is used in a reciprocating pump?
a) To obtain a continuous supply of water at uniform rate
b) To reduce suction head
c) To increase the delivery head
d) To reduce cavitation
a
10. Negative slip occurs in reciprocating pumps, when delivery pipe is ______
a) Long and suction pipe is short and pump is running at low speed
b) Long and suction pipe is short and pump is running at high speed
c) Short and suction pipe is long and pump is running at low speed
d) Short and suction pipe is long and pump is running at high speed
a
11. Why is a minimum of net positive suction head (NPSH) required for a hydraulic pump?
a) To prevent cavitation
b) To increase discharge
c) To increase suction head
d) To increase efficiency
a
12. For a given centrifugal pump _____
a) The discharge varies directly as the speed
b) The head varies inversely as the speed
c) The power varies as the square of the speed
d) The discharge varies as the square of the speed
a
Hence discharge is directly proportional to speed.
