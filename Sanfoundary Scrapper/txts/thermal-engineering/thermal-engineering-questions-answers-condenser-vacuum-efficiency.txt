3. Which of the following is the correct definition of vacuum efficiency?
a) It is the ratio of actual vacuum to atmospheric pressure
b) It is the ratio of atmospheric pressure to actual vacuum
c) It is the ratio of maximum obtainable vacuum to actual vacuum
d) It is the ratio of actual vacuum to maximum obtainable vacuum
d
Mathematically,
ηvacuum = \(\frac{Actual \, vacuum}{Maximum \, obtainable \, vacuum} \) 
4. Which of the following expressions is the correct one for calculating the vacuum efficiency of a condenser?
a) \(\frac{Actual \, vacuum}{Absolute \, pressure \, of \, steam-Barometer \, Pressure} \)

Therefore,
ηvacuum = \(\frac{Actual \, vacuum}{Maximum \, obtainable \, vacuum} \) 
but Maximum obtainable vacuum = Barometer pressure – Absolute pressure of steam
\(\frac{Actual \, vacuum}{Barometer \, Pressure-Absolute \, pressure \, of \, steam} \)

c) \(\frac{Inlet \, temperature \, of \, cooling \, water-Temp. \, corresponding \, to \, vacuum \, in \, the \, condenser}{Rise \, in \, temperature \, of \, cooling \, water} \) 
d) \(\frac{Temp. \, corresponding \, to \, vacuum \, in \, the \, condenser-Inlet \, temperature \, of \, cooling \, water}{Rise \, in \, temperature \, of \, cooling \, water} \) 
a
ηcondenser = \(\frac{Rise \, in \, temperature \, of \, cooling \, water}{Temp. \,   corresponding \, to \, vacuum \, in \, the \, condenser-Inlet \, temperature \, of \, cooling \,  water}\) 
It can also be written as
ηcondenser = \(\frac{Rise \, in \, temperature \, of \, cooling \, water}{Temp.  \, corresponding \, to \, the \, absolute \, pressure \, in \, the \, condenser-Inlet \, temperature \, of \, cooling \, water} \) 
7. The inlet and outlet temperatures of cooling water to a certain condenser are recorded to be 30°C and 40°C respectively. If the absolute pressure in the condenser is given to be 0.11 bar, determine efficiency.
a) 45.21%
b) 75.65%
c) 95.32%
d) 56.46%
d
	From steam tables corresponding to 0.11 bar
		ts = 47.71°C
	Therefore,
ηcondenser = \(\frac{Rise \, in \, temperature \, of \, cooling \, water}{Temp.  \, corresponding \, to \, the \, absolute \, pressure \, in \, the \, condenser-Inlet \, temperature \, of \, cooling \, water} \) 
(%)ηcondenser = \(\frac{t_{wo} – t_{wi}}{t_s-t_{wi}}\) x 100
Substituting the values,
ηcondenser  = \(\frac{40 – 30}{47.71-30}\) x 100 = 56.46%.
8. In a condenser, the temperature of steam entering in the condenser is observed to be 30°C. The condenser vacuum is recorded to be 670 mm of Hg. If the barometer reading is 760 mm of Hg, determine the vacuum efficiency.
a) 92.01%
b) 84.25%
c) 31.65%
d) 67.51%
a
 Using steam tables, At 30°C
		Partial pressure of steam, P = 0.04242 bar = 0.04242/0.001333 mm of Hg
= 31.82 mm of Hg
	Now, Maximum obtainable vacuum = 760 – 31.82 = 728.18 mm of Hg
Vacuum efficiency = ηvacuum = \(\frac{Actual \, vacuum}{Maximum \, obtainable \,  vacuum} \) 
			= 670 / 728.18
			= 0.9201 or 92.01%.
9. The outlet temperature of cooling water to a condenser is observed to be 42°C. Determine the inlet temperature of cooling water if the absolute pressure inside the condenser is 0.1 bar. Take condenser efficiency as 76%.
a) 12.36°C
b) 29.87°C
c) 36.21°C
d) 40.65°C
:
	Using steam tables, corresponding to 0.1 bar
			ts = 45.83°C
	We know that,
ηcondenser = \(\frac{t_{wo} – t_{wi}}{t_s-t_{wi}} \) 
	Substituting the values,
0.76=\(\frac{42- t_{wi}}{45.83-t_{wi}}  \) 
	Solving the equation for twi we get,
			twi = 29.87°C.
10. The following data refers to a steam condenser –
	Inlet temperature of cooling water = 36°C
	Absolute pressure inside the condenser = 0.12 bar
	efficiency = 78%
	Determine the outlet temperature of cooling water.
a) 42.37°C
b) 39.12°C
c) 46.49°C
d) 35.21°C
c
	Using steam tables, corresponding to 0.12 bar
	ts = 49.45°C
	We know that,
	ηcondenser = \(\frac{t_{wo} – t_{wi}}{t_s-t_{wi}} \) 
	Substituting the values,
	0.78 = \(\frac{t_{wo} – 36}{49.45-36} \) 
	Solving for two we get,
	two = 46.49°C.
