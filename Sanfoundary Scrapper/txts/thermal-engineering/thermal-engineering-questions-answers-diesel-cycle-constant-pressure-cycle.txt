c) Be independent
d) Data insufficient
a
Increase in compression ratio will decrease in term  \(\frac{ρ^γ-1}{(ρ-1)r^{γ-1}} \) therefore increase in efficiency of diesel cycle.

a) rk = volume of the cylinder at the beginning of the compression/volume of the cylinder at the end of the compression
b) rk = volume of the cylinder at the end of the compression/ volume of the cylinder at the beginning of the compression
c) rk = clearance volume/ volume of the cylinder at the beginning of the compression
d) rk = volume of the cylinder at the end of the compression/clearance volume
a
rk = volume of the cylinder at the beginning of the compression/volume of the cylinder at the end of the compression.

c) 1.4
d) 1.8
c
11. What is the efficiency of diesel cycle if γ and T denotes the specific heat ratio and temperature respectively?
a) 1 – \(\frac{T4-T1}{T3-T2} \) 
b) 1 – \(\frac{T4-T1}{γ(T3-T2)} \) 
c) 1 – \(\frac{γ(T4-T1)}{T3-T2} \) 
d) 1 – \(\frac{T4-T1}{(γ-1)(T3-T2)} \) 
b
Qrejection = mcv(T4 – T1)
Efficiency of diesel engine = \(\frac{Q1-Q2}{Q1} \) 
 Efficiency of diesel engine = 1 – \(\frac{T4-T1}{γ(T3-T2)} \)
