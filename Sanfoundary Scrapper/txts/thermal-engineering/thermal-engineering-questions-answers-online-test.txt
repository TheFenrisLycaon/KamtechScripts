a) 15KW
b) 22.5KJ/sec
c) 7.5KJ/sec
d) 25KJ/sec
a
Q = Q = hA∆T
Q = 75×2×(150-50)
Q = 15 kW.
2. Nusselt number for fully developed turbulent flow in a pipe is given by Nu=C Rea Prb. the values of a and b are?
a) a=0.5 and b=0.33 for heating and cooling
b) a=0.5 and b=0.4 for heating and b=0.3 for cooling
c) a=0.8 and b=0.4 for heating and b=0.3 for cooling
d) a=0.8 and b=0.3 for heating and b=0.4 for cooling
c
Nu=0.023 Re0.8 Prn
Where, n= 0.4 for heating
And n = 0.3 for cooling.
3. Which of the following non-dimensional numbers is used for transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow in the free convection?
a) Reynolds number
b) Grashoff number
c) Peclet number
d) Rayleigh number
b
4. Which non-dimensional numbers relates the thermal boundary layer and hydrodynamic boundary layer?
a) Rayleigh number
b) Peclet number
c) Grashoff number
d) Prandtl number
d
\(\frac{δ}{(δ)t} = \frac{hydrodynamic \, boundary \, layer}{thermodynamic \, boundary \, layer}\) = Pr1/3.
5. The laminar boundary layer occurs when a cold fluid over a hot plate. In which of the following positions, the temperature gradient assumes zero value?
a) At bottom of boundary layer
b) In mid free stream of fluid
c) At top of boundary layer
d) At the junction of laminar and turbulent boundary layer
c
6. The characteristic length for computing Grashoff number of horizontal cylinder is ___________
a) The length of the cylinder
b) The diameter of the cylinder
c) The perimeter of the cylinder
d) The radius of the cylinder
b
7. In laminar developing flow through a pipe with constant wall temperature, the magnitude of the pipe wall inner surface convective heat transfer coefficient shall be maximum at the:
a) Middle length of flow
b) Beginning of flow
c) End of flow
d) One third of the length of flow
d
8. For a fluid with Prandtl number Pr>1, momentum boundary layer thickness?
a) Decreases rapidly compared to the thermal boundary layer thickness
b) And thermal boundary layer thickness increase at the same rate
c) Increases rapidly as compared to thermal boundary layer thickness
d) And thermal boundary layer thickness decrease at the same rate
c
For Pr>1 , δ>(δ)t
Therefore momentum boundary layer thickness increases rapidly compared to the thermal boundary layer thickness.
9. Water (Prandtl number ≈6) flows over a flat plate which is heated over the entire length. Which one of the following relationship between the hydrodynamic boundary layer thickness (δ) and the thermal boundary layer thickness (δ)t is true?
a) (δ)t > δ
b) (δ)t < δ
c) (δ)t = δ
d) Cannot be predicted
b
Since Prandtl number Pr = 6 > 1, therefore from above equation,
(δ)t < δ.
10. If qw =2500x where x is in m and in the direction of flow (x=0 at the inlet), the bulk mean temperature of the water leaving the pipe in °C is ________
a) 71
b) 76
c) 79
d) 81
d
5000×π×0.05×3=0.01×4.18×103(t2-20)
t2=76°C
At the outlet flux can be calculated by,
Qw = h(ts-t1)
5000=1000(ts-76)
ts=81°C.
