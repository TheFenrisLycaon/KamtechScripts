b) 1.2
c) 1.4
d) 1.8
c
10. For same compression ratio and heat supplied
a) Otto cycle is more efficient
b) Diesel cycle is more efficient
c) Dual cycle is more efficient
d) Both diesel and otto cycle are equally efficient
a
Efficiency of diesel cycle = 1 – \(\frac{ρ^γ-1}{(ρ-1)r^{γ-1}}\).
11. What is the efficiency of an ideal air standard otto cycle if the compression ratio is 8.5?
a) 67.5%
b) 57.5%
c) 48.5%
d) 47.5%
b
Efficiency of otto cycle = 1 – \(\frac{1}{8.5^{1.4-1}} \) = 57.5%.
12. What is the efficiency of an ideal air standard otto cycle if the clearance volume is 10% of the swept volume?
a) 39.8%
b) 39.2%
c) 61.7%
d) 61.1%
c
 r = 1.1/0.1=11
Efficiency of otto cycle = 1 – \(\frac{1}{r^{γ-1}} \) 
Efficiency of otto cycle = 1 – \(\frac{1}{11^{1.4-1}} \)=0.6167=61.7%.
