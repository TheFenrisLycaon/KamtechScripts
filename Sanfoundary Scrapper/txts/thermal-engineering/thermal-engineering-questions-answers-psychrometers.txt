b) The dew bulb temperature of air
c) They dry bulb temperature of air
d) The ambient air temperature
b
3. When a stream of moist air is passed over a cold and dry cooling coil such that no condensation takes place, then the air stream will get along the line of __________
a) Constant wet bulb temperature
b) Constant dew point temperature
c) Constant relative humidity
d) Constant enthalpy
b

b) Wet bulb temperature of air
c) Hot water temperature
d) Air conditional room temperature
a
6. What happens when warm saturated air is cooled?
a) Excess moisture condenses
b) Excess moisture condenses but relative humidity remains unchanged
c) Excess moisture condenses and specific humidity increases but relative humidity remains unchanged
d) Specific humidity increases and relative humidity increases
b
7. Air at 35 and 25 degree Celsius dew point temperature passes through the water shower whose temperature is maintained at 20 degree Celsius. What is the process involved?
a) Cooling and humidification
b) Sensible cooling
c) Cooling and dehumidification

a) Effective temperature is the index which correlates the combined effects of air dry bulb temperature, air humidity and air movement upon human comfort
b) The value of effective temperature in winter and summer should be same for human comfort
c) Effective temperature and wet bulb temperature are same
d) The valve of the effective temperature should be higher in winter than in summer for comfort
a
9. What is the relative humidity when the wet bulb depression is zero?
a) 100%
b) 60%
c) 40%
