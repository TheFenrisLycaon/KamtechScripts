3. Which of the following expressions for degree of reaction (Rd) of a reaction turbine stage is correct?
a) Rd=\(\frac{Heat \, drop \, in \, moving \, blades}{Heat \, drop \, in \, the \, stage}\) 
b) Rd=\(\frac{Heat \, drop \, in \, the \, stage}{Heat \, drop \, in \, moving \, blades}\) 
c) Rd=\(\frac{Heat \, drop \, in \, fixed \, blades}{Heat \, drop \, in \, the \, stage}\) 
d) Rd=\(\frac{Heat \, drop \, in \, the \, stage}{Heat \, drop \, in \, fixed \, blades}\) 
a
Mathematically,
Rd=\(\frac{Δh_m}{Δh_f+Δh_m} \) 
where, Δhm = heat drop in moving blades and
Δhf = heat drop in the fixed blades.
4. Which of the following is the correct formula for calculating the degree of reaction of a reaction turbine?
a) Rd=\(\frac{2C_{bl}(C_{w1}+C_{w2})}{C_{r2}^2-C_{r1}^2} \) 
b) Rd=\(\frac{C_{r2}^2-C_{r1}^2}{2C_{bl} (C_{w1}+C_{w2})} \) 
c) Rd=\(\frac{C_{bl}(C_{w1}+C_{w2})}{2(C_{r2}^2-C_{r1}^2)} \) 
d) Rd=\(\frac{2(C_{r2}^2-C_{r1}^2)}{C_{bl}(C_{w1}+C_{w2})} \) 
b
Rd=\(\frac{Heat \, drop \, in \, moving \, blades}{Heat \, drop \, in \, the \, stage}\) 
Since,	 Heat drop in a moving blade = \(\frac{C_{r2}^2-C_{r1}^2}{2}\), and
Heat drop in the stage = Cbl(Cw1 + CW2)
Therefore,  Rd=\(\frac{C_{r2}^2-C_{r1}^2}{2C_{bl} (C_{w1}+C_{w2})} \)
