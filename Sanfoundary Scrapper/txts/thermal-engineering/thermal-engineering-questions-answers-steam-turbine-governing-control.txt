b
2. Which of the following is NOT a method of steam turbine governing?
a) By-pass governing
b) Throttle governing
c) Steam governing
d) Nozzle governing
c
3. Which of the following statements about throttle governing is wrong?
a) It cannot be used in small turbines
b) It has a relatively simpler mechanism
c) Steam is throttled whenever the load falls below the design load
d) Its initial cost is less
a
4. In case of throttle governing, the beat valve is operated using oil supply. The oil is supplies using a _____
a) centrifugal pump
b) servomotor
c) reciprocatory pump
d) diaphragm pump
b
5. The oil servomotor in case of throttle governing mechanism is controlled by a _____ governor.
a) centrifugal
b) reciprocatory
c) diaphragm
d) gear
a
6. The relationship between steam consumption and load in throttle governing is given by _____
a) Wilson’s line
b) Wilkinson’s line
c) Willan’s line
d) Wilber’s line
c

d) It is cannot be employed for simple impulse turbine
d
12. Which of the following method of steam turbine governing is ideal for reaction turbines?
a) Throttle governing
b) Nozzle governing
c) By-pass governing
