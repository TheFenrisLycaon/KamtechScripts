1. What is ‘state point’?
a) It is that point on h-s diagram which represents the condition of steam at that instant
b) It is that point on P-v diagram which represents the condition of steam at that instant
c) It is that point on T-s diagram which represents the condition of steam at that instant
d) It is that point on P-s diagram which represents the condition of steam at that instant
a
2. The curve traced by joining all the state points is called _____
a) state point curve
b) state point locus
c) state point diagram
d) state point graph
b
3. Which of the following is the correct expression for reheat factor?
a) \(\frac{Cumulaive \, heat \, drop}{Isentropic \, enthalpy \, drop} \) 
b) \(\frac{Isentropic \, enthalpy \, drop}{Cumulaive \, heat \, drop} \) 
c) \(\frac{Adiabatic \, heat \, drop}{Isentropic \, enthalpy \, drop} \) 
d) \(\frac{Isentropic \, enthalpy \, drop}{Adiabatic \, heat \, drop} \) 
a
Therefore, the correct answer is –
Reheat factor = \(\frac{Cumulaive \, heat \, drop}{Isentropic \, enthalpy \, drop}  = \frac{h_{cum}}{h_{adi}} \) 
4. The value of reheat factor doesn’t depend on _____
a) stage efficiency
b) initial condition of steam
c) final pressure
d) atmospheric temperature
d
5. Which of the following statements regarding reheat factor is TRUE?
a) It is always less than 1
b) It is always greater than 1
c) It is always equal to or less than 1
d) It might be less than one
b

a) efficiency and power developed both are increased
b) efficiency is decreased and power developed is increased
c) efficiency and power developed both are decreased
d) efficiency is increased and the power developed is decreased
d
8. Which of the following losses does not come under ‘Internal losses in steam turbines’?
a) Losses due to wetness of steam
b) Losses in regulating valve
c) Leaving velocity losses
d) Mechanical losses

b) Losses due to shrouding are a type of internal losses
c) Mechanical losses are external losses
d) Losses in exhaust piping are a type of external losses
d
10. Losses directly connected with the steam conditions while it is flowing through the turbine are called internal losses.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Losses which do not influence steam conditions are called external losses.
a) True
b) False
a
