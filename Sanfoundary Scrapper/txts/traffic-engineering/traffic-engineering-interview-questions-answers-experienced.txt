b) At Scene-Investigation
c) Technical Preparation
d) Cause Analysis
a
2. Analysis of accident reconstruction studies is done by which of the following step in the accident investigation?
a) Professional Reconstruction
b) At Scene-Investigation
c) Technical Preparation
d) Cause Analysis
d
3. The total accident hazard is expressed as ______
a) accident Rate per Kilometer
b) accident involvement Rate
c) death rate based on population
d) death rate based on registration
a
R=A/L, where, R = total accident rate per km for a year, A = total number of accident occurring in one year, L = length of control section in kms
4. Numbers of drivers of vehicles with specific characteristics who were participants in accidents per 100 million vehicle-kms of travel is known as ______
a) Accident Rate per Kilometer
b) Accident involvement Rate
c) Death rate based on population
d) Death rate based on registration
b
5. The traffic hazard to life in a community is expressed as _____
a) accident Rate per Kilometer
b) accident involvement Rate
c) death rate based on population
d) death rate based on registration
c
6. Which rate reflects the accident exposure for an entire area?
a) Death rate based on population
b) Accident Rate per Kilometer
c) Accident Rate based on vehicle-kms of travel
d) Accident involvement Rate
a
R = B x 100000/P, here, R = death rate per 100,000 population, B = total number of traffic death in one year and P = population of area
7. The rate which reflects the accident exposure for the entire area and is similar to death rate based on population is _______
a) death rate based on population
b) death rate based on registration
c) accident Rate based on vehicle-kms of travel
d) accident involvement Rate
b
R = B x 10000/M, here, R = death rate per 10,000 vehicles registered, B = total number of deaths in traffic in a year and M = number of motor vehicles listed in the area.
8. The accident hazard is expressed as ______
a) death rate based on population
b) death rate based on registration
c) accident Rate based on vehicle-kms of travel
d) accident involvement Rate
c
9. Accident reconstruction helps in ______
a) controlling or imposing rules to control or check movement of vehicles on road at high speed
b) to organize and interpret the study
c) to determine why the accident occurred
d) obtain information at the scene
c
10. The data which is not required to determine the pre-collision speed is ________
a) mass of the vehicle
b) velocities after collision
c) path of a vehicle as it proceeds towards collision point
d) road width
d
11. What is a collision diagram?
a) Schematic diagram of the collision of two vehicles that occur during turning movements
b) Schematic graph of collision of two vehicles
c) Schematic diagram of collision of three vehicles occur during turning movements
d) Schematic graph of collision at turning movements
a
12. Poisson impact theory divides impact into how many parts?
a) 2
b) 3
c) 4
d) 5
a
