a) 3
b) 2
c) 4
d) 5
b
7. Length of the transition curve is the maximum of length due to _____
a) centrifugal force, superelevation, and empirical
b) centrifugal force, superelevation, and tangent
c) superelevation, centripetal, and empirical
d) superelevation, centripetal, and design speed
a
8. Which one of the following is not an advantage of spiral transition?
a) Easy path for drivers to follow
b) Aesthetics
c) Agreeable arrangement of superelevation runoff
d) Less delay
d
9. The distance from the centreline of the inside lane to the nearest roadside sight blockage is called.
a) Length of curve
b) Apex
c) Mid-ordinate
d) Tangent
c
  		    M = R(1-cos θ/2)
              where, M = mid-ordinate
                         R = radius of curvature
                         θ = angle of deflection.
10. What are the two types of vertical curves?
a) Crest and sag
b) Crest and plume
c) Sag and sink
d) Sink and fall
a
11. What is the mid-ordinate of a curve with a radius of curvature 2m and angle of deflection = 60°?
a) 0.342
b) 0.268
c) 0.112
d) 0.245
b
where, M = mid-ordinate
           R = radius of curvature
           θ = angle of deflection
M = R(1-cos θ/2) = 2(1-cos60/2) = 0.268 m.
12. The sight distance in a sag vertical curve is limited by which factor given below during night time driving condition?
a) Design speed
b) Driver’s height
c) Headlamp range
d) Ruling speed
c

a) True
b) False
b
14. Which of the following is not a feature of cross-section elements of a highway?
a) Shoulders
b) Side slopes
c) Curbs
d) Signal
d
