b
3. What is the Perception Reaction Time for braking on highways?
a) 1 second
b) 2.5 seconds
c) 3.5 seconds
d) 3 seconds
b
4. The initial speed of the vehicle is 80 kmph. What is the reaction distance?
a) 45.5 m
b) 55.2 m
c) 55.6 m
d) 22.24 m
c
 	         here,
		       d = reaction distance
		       S = initial speed of vehicle, kmph
		       t = reaction time, s = 2.5 seconds
	        d = 0.278 X 80 X 2.5 = 55.6 kmph
5. A vehicle travels at a speed of 60 kmph. The driver then sees a stopped car on the road ahead. How far will the driver’s vehicle travel before the driver’s foot reach the brake?
a) 41.7 m
b) 40 m
c) 31.2 m
d) 45 m
a
	         here,
		       d = reaction distance
		       S = initial speed of vehicle, kmph
		       t = reaction time, s = 2.5 seconds
	         d = 0.278 X 60 X 2.5 = 41.7 kmph
6. The driver notices a red traffic signal towards the front. The vehicle moves 11m before he can observe and apply brakes on the vehicle. At what speed the vehicle was moving?
a) 30 kmph
b) 40 kmph
c) 50 kmph
d) 60 kmph
b
	         here,
		       d = reaction distance
		       S = initial speed of vehicle, kmph
		       t = reaction time, s = 1 seconds for reaction on a traffic signal
		       d = 0.278 X S X 1
		     11 = 0.278 X S X 1
		      S  = 11/0.278 = 39.5 kmph = 40 kmph (approx.)
7. What is the AASHTO recommendation for a PRT for stops on rural roads where collision avoidance maneuver is required?
a) 9.1 seconds
b) 10 seconds
c) 8 seconds
d) 3 seconds
d
8. Which of the following is not a category of expectancy?
a) Continuity
b) Event
c) Temporal
d) Complexity of reaction
d
9. A driver with a perception-reaction time of 2.5s is driving with a speed of 75 kmph. He observes an accident on the road ahead. Workout the distance the vehicle will travel before the driver applies brakes.
a) 49 m
b) 52 m
c) 50 m
d) 53 m
b
	         here,
		       d = reaction distance
		       S = initial speed of vehicle, kmph
		       t = reaction time, s = 2.5 seconds
		       d = 0.278 X S X 2.5
		       d = 0.278 X S X 2.5
		       d = 52.125 m = 52 m (approx.)

a) 14 to 14.5 seconds
b) 10.2 to 11.2 seconds
c) 12.1 to 12.9 seconds
d) 9.1 to 9.9 seconds
a
11. What can be done to avoid Expectant accidents on the road?
a) Set up Speed limits
b) Two lane roads
c) Guide signs
d) Speed breakers
c
