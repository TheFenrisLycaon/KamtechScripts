1. Which of the following is not a correction or adjustment required for multi-lane highways?
a) Lane width
b) Lateral clearance
c) Median time
d) Length of highway
d
2. What is the free-flow speed (FFS) of a multilane highway?
a) FFS = BFFS-flw-flc-fm-fa
b) FFS = BFFS+flw-flc-fm-fa
c) FFS = BFFS-flw-flc-fm+fa
d) FFS = BFFS-flw+flc-fm-fa
a
3. How much does the FFS decrease when 10 foot lanes are used?
a) 6.6 mph
b) 6 mph
c) 10 mph
d) 2 mph
a
4. Calculate flc (lateral clearance) for a 4 lane highway with milepost markers which are located 3 feet to the right of the travel lane?
a) 9
b) 11
c) 5
d) 6
a
				          = 6 + 3 = 9
The flc (lateral clearance) for a 4 lane highway with milepost markers which are located 3 feet to the right of the travel lane is 9 feet.

a) Uncontrolled excess form roadside
b) Right turns
c) Controlled excess form roadside
d) Traffic signals
a
6. Equivalent flow rate is calculated by which of the following?
a) vp = V/(PHF x N x fhv x fp)
b) vp = V x (PHF x N x fhv x fp)
c) vp = V/(PHF + N x fhv x fp)
d) vp = V/(PHF x N + fhv x fp)
