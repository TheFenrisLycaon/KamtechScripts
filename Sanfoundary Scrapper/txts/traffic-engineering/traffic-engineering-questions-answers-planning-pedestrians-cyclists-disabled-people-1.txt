c) Calibration study
d) Observation study
b
2. Which main trait is obtained from Pedestrian study?
a) Crosswalks at signalized and un-signalized intersection
b) Crosswalks at flyovers
c) Pedestrian’s origin and destination
d) Pedestrian’s traffic
a
3. What is the standard speed at which pedestrians cross the crosswalks?
a) 3-5ft/s
b) 2-3ft/s
c) 5-7ft/s
d) 1-3ft/s
a
4. Bicycle LOS is based on __________
a) Quality of service linked to the comfort of car drivers
b) Quality of service linked to the comfort of cyclists
c) Speed of cycles
d) Density of cycles
b
5. Warning signs dealing with pedestrians and cyclists have which colour background?
a) Red
b) Lime Green
c) Yellow
d) Black
b
6. What are the two approaches considered when minimum pedestrian condition is not met?
a) Pedestrian actuator and retiming of signal
b) Pedestrian actuator and redesigning
c) Retiming of signal and traffic controller
d) Traffic controller and crossway broadened
a
7. What is the standard walking speed used in timing signals where older pedestrians are dominant?
a) 4ft/s
b) 5ft/s
c) 2ft/s
d) 3.5ft/s
d
8. Pedestrian actuators are useful when pedestrians are scarce.
a) True
b) False
a
9. What is the main demerit of retiming the traffic signal for pedestrians and cyclists?
a) Delay of vehicles
b) Delay of pedestrians and cyclist
c) Accidents
d) Disruption of traffic
a
10. Which of the following formula gives the amount of time needed for pedestrians to safely cross the crosswalk in a pre-timed traffic signal?
a) G = 3.2 – 0.27 Npeds + L/S
b) G = 3.2 + 0.27 Npeds + L/S
c) G = 0.27 Npeds + L/S
d) G = 3.2 + 0.27 Npeds
b
  			G = 3.2 – 0.27 Npeds + L/S
			here,
			        G = Amount of time needed for pedestrians to safely cross the          			              crosswalk or Pedestrian green time
			        C = Amount of time for safe crossing of pedestrians
			        Npeds = Number of pedestrians
			        L = Length of crosswalk
			        S = Walking speed of pedestrians.
11. What should be done when minimum green does not provide safe crossing for pedestrians?
a) Crosswalk removed
b) Retiming of signal
c) Traffic controller
d) Pedestrian push button
d
