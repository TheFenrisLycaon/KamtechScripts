1. The total time of travel, including stop and delay, to travel from one point of a section to another under existing traffic condition is called __________
a) Operational delay
b) Travel time
c) Fixed delay
d) Approach delay
d
2. What is the purpose of a Travel Time and Delay Study?
a) To assess the quality of traffic movement
b) To assess the time taken to travel by various vehicles
c) To evaluate the traffic stream
d) For survey data
a
3. In which of the following cases Travel Time and Delay Study is not used?
a) To compare operational conditions before and after enhancements have been made
b) To compare operational inadequacies in each project
c) To monitor LOS of road
d) To compare the design width of the road in each condition
d
4. Which of the following is not a method for obtaining travel time and delay studies?
a) Floating car method
b) Average speed method
c) Interview method
d) Spot speed method
d
5. In which of the following methods given below does the observer travels and makes a round trip along a test section in a traffic stream?
a) Floating car method
b) Average speed method
c) Spot speed method
d) License plate method
b
6. Which given formula gives the volume of traffic in westbound direction?
a) qw = (ma+mo-mp)/(ta+tw)
b) qw = (ma+mo-mp)/(ta-tw)
c) qw = (ma-mo-mp)/(ta+tw)
d) qw = (ma+mo+mp)/(ta+tw)
a
7. In which method a test vehicle is selected at random?
a) Elevated observation method
b) Average speed method
c) License plate method
d) Floating car method
a
8. Photographic method is suitable only for long test sections.
a) True
b) False
b
9. Which travel time and delay study method is usually adopted in a farm or an establishment?
a) Photographic method
b) Elevated observation method
c) License plate method
d) Interview method
d
10. Average travel time in westbound direction is obtained from which of the given formula?
a) tw(avg) = tw-((mo-mp)/qw)
b) tw(avg) = tw+((mo-mp)/qw)
c) tw(avg) = tw-((mo-mp)+qw)
d) tw(avg) = tw-((mo+mp)/qw)
a
tw(avg) = tw-((mo-mp)/qw)
where, tw(avg) = Average travel time in westbound direction
	mo = number of vehicles that overtake the test car
           mp = number of vehicles that the test car passes when it is travelling westwards
           tw = time taken to travel to the west.
