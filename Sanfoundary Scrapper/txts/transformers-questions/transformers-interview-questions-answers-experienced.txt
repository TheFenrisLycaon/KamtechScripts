11. A 600-kVA, single-phase transformer with 0.012 pu resistance and 0.06 pu reactance is connected in parallel with a 300-kVA transformer with 0.014 pu resistance and 0.045 pu reactance to share a load of 800 kVA at 0.8 pf lagging. Find how they share the load (a) when both the secondary voltages are 440 V.
a) S1= 377+j305.2
b) S2= 377-j305.2
c) S1= 264+ j171.6
d) S1= 377-j305.2
d
Z2= 2(0.014+j0.045)
Z1+Z2= 0.04+ j0.15
The load is SL = 800(0.8-0.6j)
Thus, S1= Z2/Z1+Z2 SL, we get S1= 377- j305.2
S2 = Z1/Z1+Z2 SL, we get S2= 264-j171.6.
