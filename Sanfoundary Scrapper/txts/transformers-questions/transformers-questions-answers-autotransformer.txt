b) Lower losses
c) Higher exciting current
d) Better voltage regulation
c
6. Two-winding transformer of a given VA rating if connected as an autotransformer can handle ___________
a) Higher VA
b) Lower VA
c) Same VA
d) Cannot be found
a

a) True
b) False
a
9. Ratio of winding material needed for autotransformer to thr two winding transformer is ______
a) 1- V2/V1
b) 1- N2/N1
c) 1- V2/V1 and  1- N2/N1
