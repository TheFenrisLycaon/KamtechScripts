1. For two transformers connected in parallel, not having unequal percentage impedances, which statement is correct?
a) Short-circuiting of the secondaries
b) Power factor of one of the transformers is leading while that of the other lagging
c) Transformers having higher copper losses will have negligible core losses
d) Loading of the transformers not in proportion to their kVA ratings
d
2. For the parallel operation of two single phase transformers it is necessary that they should have ________
a) same efficiency
b) same polarity
c) same kVA rating
d) same number of turns on the secondary side
b
3. Transformers operating in parallel mode of operation will share the load depending upon their ___________
a) leakage reactance
b) per unit impedance
c) efficiencies
d) ratings
b
4. What will happen if the transformers working in parallel are not connected with regard to polarity?
a) The power factor of the two trans-formers will be different from the power factor of common load
b) Incorrect polarity will result in dead short circuit
c) The transformers will not share load in proportion to their kVA ratings
d) Cannot be determined
b
5. If the percentage impedances of the two transformers working in parallel are different, then ______________________
a) transformers will be overheated
b) power factors of both the transformers will be same
c) parallel operation will be not possible
d) parallel operation will still be possible, but the power factors at which the two transformers operate will be different from the power factor of the common load
d
6. A delta/star transformer is connected in parallel to a star/delta transformer. The turn ratio former is x times latter, the x is _________
a) 3
b) 1/3
c) √3
d) 1/√3
a
Ture ratio of star 2 / Turn ratio of delta 2= Vph/√3/Vph= 1/√3
Thus, turn ratio of star1/delta1 = 3 * turn ratio of star 2/ delta 2.
7. While connecting two transformers in parallel voltage around the local loop _________
a) positive
b) negative
c) equals zero
d) insufficient information
c
8. For three phase power transformers relative phase displacement should be ____________
a) 00
b) 300
c) 900
d) 1800
a
9. Y/Y and Y/D transformers can be paralleled.
a) True
b) False
b
10. Why transformers connected in parallel should have same voltage ratio?
a) To avoid full load circulating current
b) To avoid no-load circulating current
c) To avoid other losses
d) To avoid all type of currents
b
11. Why transformers are paralleled?
a) Economical than replacing by one single large unit
b) Less maintaining cost
c) To handle more load
d) Economical factors, more load capacity, less maintenance
d
