b) 2/√3: √2
c) 1:1
d) Can’t say
a
5. The secondaries of two transformers are in ratio ____
a) 1:1
b) √3/2: 1
c) √3: 1
d) √2: 1
a
6. In Scott connection neutral point is located at _______________
a) Three phase side at teaser
b) Two-phase side
c) Three phase side secondary
d) Anywhere
a
7. For single-phase to three-phase change in transformer which of the following connection is most suitable?
a) Scott connection
b) Scott connection with resistor network
c) Scott connection with some energy storing device
d) Any of the mentioned
c

a) Scott connection is used
b) Each secondary winding is divided
c) Each primary winding is divided
d) Can’t be done
b
9. In 3/6-phase connection of transformers _______________
a) Secondaries are two stars in phase sequence
b) Secondaries are two deltas in phase sequence
c) Secondaries are two stars in phase opposition
d) Secondaries are two deltas in phase opposition
c
10. 3/6-phase circuit is employed for providing DC path in some circuits.
a) True
b) False
a
11. Two single-phase furnaces let’s say, A and B are supplied at 100 V by means of a Scott-connected transformer combination from a 3-phase 6600 V system. The voltage of furnace A is leading. Calculate on of the line current on the 3-phase side, when the furnace A takes 400 kW at 0.707 pf lagging and B takes 800 kW at unity pf.
a) 110 A
b) 99 A
c) 250 A
d) 149 A
b
√3/2 (N1/N2) = 57.16
Furnace currents are= Ia = 400*1000/ (100*0.707) = 5658 A
Similarly, Ib= 8000 A
On 3-phase side, IA= 5658/57.16 = 99 A.
