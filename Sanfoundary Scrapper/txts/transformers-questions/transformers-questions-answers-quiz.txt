a) R2i2 + L2*di2/dt – M*di1/dt
b) R2i2 + L2*di2/dt + M*di1/dt
c) -R2i2 + L2*di2/dt – M*di1/dt
d) -R2i2 – L2*di2/dt + M*di1/dt
d
3. Core magnetizing current is __________________
a) i1-i2/a
b) i1+i2/a
c) i1/a-i2/a
d) i1/a+i2/a
a
4.  Which of the following ratio is equal to N1/N2?
a) L1/L2
b) L2/L1
c) √ (L1/L2)
d) √ (L2/L1)
c
5. A transformer has turn ratio of a = 10. The primary on application of 200 V draws 4 A with secondary open circuited which is found to have a voltage of 1950 V. Then, L1 is equal to ______________
a) 0.19 H
b) 0.159 H
c) 0.9 H
d) 0.259 H
b
Here frequency denoted by f is equal to 50 Hz. While Xm is calculated previously by taking ratio of voltage with currents.
6. 5. A transformer has turn ratio of a = 10. The primary on application of 200 V draws 4 A with secondary open circuited which is found to have a voltage of 1950 V. Then, M is equal to ______________
a) 1.9 H
b) 1.55 H
c) 9 H
d) 2.59 H
b
ψmax = 1950/ √2π = 8.78 Wb-T.
M= ψmax/ i1(max)= 8.78/ (√2*4) = 1.55 H.
