b) Frequency range is very large for these transformers
c) Frequency used is negligible
d) Can’t say
b
5. When series leakage inductances are ignored then the region is called as _____________
a) Low-frequency region
b) High-frequency region
c) Mid-frequency region
d) Ultra high-frequency region
c
6. What is the gain of the transformer in mid-band region?
a) [N2/N1] [RL ‘/(R+RL’)].
b) [N2/N1] [RL ‘/(R+RL’+jωL)].
c) AH=A0/ [1+(ω/ ωH)2]1/2
d) AL=A0/ [1+(ω/ ωL)2]1/2
a
VL’=VS [RL ‘/(R+RL’)]
[N2/N1]VL=VS [RL ‘/(R+RL’)]
A0= VL/VS= [N2/N1] [RL ‘/(R+RL’)]
