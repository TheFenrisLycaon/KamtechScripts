a
7. Which of the following symbol is used for substitution command?
a) n
b) N

8. Which of the following is a correct syntax for performing substitution on a file?
a) :address/source_pattern/target_pattern/flag
b) :address/target_pattern source_pattern/flag
c) :address/flag
d) :address
a
:address/source_pattern/target_pattern/flag
For example, if we want to perform substitution on line number 1 to 50, source pattern is ‘directory’ and target pattern is ‘member’ then,
:1,$s/directory/member/g
9. We cannot leave the flag field empty while performing the substitution.
a) True
b) False
b
:1,$s/directory/member
Then substitution will only be carried out for the first occurrence in each addressed line.    
10. The target pattern is optional.
a) True
b) False
a
:1,$s/directory/ /g        // every instance of ‘directory’ will be deleted from each line.
11. Which of the following commands can be used to replace ‘professor’ with ‘director’ throughout the whole file?
a) 1,$s/professor/director/g
b) %s/professor/director/g
c) 1,$s/professor/director
d) 1,$s/professor/director/g and %s/professor/director/g
d

:%/abd/mash/wc - replaces the string ‘abd’ to ‘mas
h’ using confirmatory flag
:1,%/file01/file02/g - invalid command
