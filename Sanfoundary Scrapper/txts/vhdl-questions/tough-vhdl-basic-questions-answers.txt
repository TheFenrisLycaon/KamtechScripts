6. The given code represents a convertor. Which kind of convertor it is?
ENTITY convert IS
PORT(b: IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 DOWNTO 0);
           x : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0));
END convert;
ARCHITECTURE convertor OF covert IS
BEGIN
PROCESS(b)
BEGIN
CASE b IS
WHEN “0000” => x <= “1111110”;
WHEN “0001” => x <= “0110000”;
WHEN “0010” => x <= “1101101”;
WHEN “0011” => x <= “1111001”;
WHEN “0100” => x <= “0110011”;
WHEN “0101” => x <= “1011011”;

WHEN “0111” => x <= “1110000”;
WHEN “1000” => x <= “1111111”;
WHEN “1001” => x <= “1110011”;
WHEN OTHERS => x <= “0000000”;
END CASE;
END PROCESS;
END convertor;
a) Gray to BCD
b) 7 segment to BCD
c) BCD to gray
d) BCD to 7 segment display
d
7. What is the function of the below code?
ENTITY my_logic IS
PORT (din : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0);
             Count : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 DOWNTO 0));
END my_logic;
ARCHITECTURE behavior OF my_logic IS
BEGIN
Count <= “0000”
PROCESS(din)
BEGIN
L1: FOR i IN 0 TO 7 LOOP
IF(din(i) = ‘1’) THEN
Count = count+1;
ELSE
NEXT L1;
END LOOP;
END PROCESS;
END behavior;
a) To count number of ones in the given data
b) To count number of zeroes in the given data
c) To reverse the order of given data
d) To perform binary multiplication of two data inputs
a

             Count : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(3 DOWNTO 0));
END my_logic;
ARCHITECTURE behavior OF my_logic IS
BEGIN
Count <= “0000”
PROCESS(din)
BEGIN
L1: FOR i IN 0 TO 7 LOOP
IF(din(i) = ‘1’) THEN
Count = count+1;
