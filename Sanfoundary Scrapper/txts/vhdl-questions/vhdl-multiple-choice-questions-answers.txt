11. Which logic circuit is described in the following code?
LIBRARY IEEE;
USE IEEE.std_logic_1164.all;
 
ENTITY system IS
GENERIC (l : INTEGER := 3);
PORT ( a, b : IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR ( l DOWNTO 0);
              c     : IN STD_LOGIC;
              x     : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR (l DOWNTO 0)
              y     : OUT STD_LOGIC);
END system;
ARCHITECTURE design OF system IS
BEGIN
PROCESS (a, b, c)
VARIABLE z : STD_LOGIC_VECTOR ( l DOWNTO 0);
BEGIN
z(0) := c;
FOR I IN 0 TO l LOOP
x(i) &lt; = a(i) XOR b(i) XOR z(i);
z(i+1) &lt;= (a(i) AND b(i)) OR (a(i) AND z(i)) OR (b(i) AND z(i));
END LOOP;
y <= z(l);
END PROCESS;
END design;
