1. In which part of the VHDL code, components must be declared?
a) Library
b) Entity
c) Architecture
d) Configuration
c
2. Which of the following function is used to map the component?
a) COMPONENT INSTANTIATE
b) PORT MAP
c) GENERIC MAP
d) USE
b
3. How many ways are there in VHDL to map the components?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4
b
4. What is the property of Positional mapping?
a) Easier to write
b) Less error prone
c) Ports can be left unconnected
d) Difficult to write
a
5. __________ mapping is less error prone.
a) Port
b) Positional
c) Nominal
d) Generic
c
6. A component has 3 ports- two inputs(a and b) and one output(y). Which of the following statement is for the positional mapping of the component?
a) LABEL : my_component PORT MAP (l, m, n);
b) LABEL : my_component PORT MAP (y, a);
c) LABEL : my_component PORT MAP (l => a, m => b, n => y);
d) LABEL : my_component PORT MAP(a, b, y>= a);
a
7. The ports of a component can be left unconnected.
a) True
b) False
a
8. Which of the following is the right way to leave a port unconnected?
a) L1 : my_component PORT MAP(a); a <= OPEN;
b) L1 : my_component PORT MAP(a := OPEN);
c) L1: my_component PORT MAP(a => OPEN);
d) L1 : my_component PORT MAP(a); a := OPEN;
c
9. It is not necessary that the order of the arguments in PORT MAP is taken as the order in which ports are declared.
a) True
b) False
b
COMPONENT my_component IS
PORT (
a, b, c : IN BIT;
x, y : OUT BIT);
END COMPONENT;
U1: my_component PORT MAP(p, q, r, s, t);
Here, in the component instantiation statement p, q, r, s and t will corresponds to a, b, c, x and y respectively because of the order used at the time of declaration is inherited in the component instantiation statement. 
10. How to declare a 2 input OR gate in the structural modeling?
a)
    COMPONENT or IS
     PORT ( a, b : IN BIT;
                  x, y : OUT BIT);
    END COMPONENT;
b)
     COMPONENT or IS
     PORT ( a, b : IN BIT;
                  y : OUT BIT);
    END COMPONENT;
c)
    COMPONENT or_gate IS
     PORT ( a, b : IN BIT;
                  x,  y : OUT BIT);
    END COMPONENT;
d)
    COMPONENT or_gate IS
     PORT ( a, b : IN BIT;
                  y : OUT BIT);
    END COMPONENT;
d
