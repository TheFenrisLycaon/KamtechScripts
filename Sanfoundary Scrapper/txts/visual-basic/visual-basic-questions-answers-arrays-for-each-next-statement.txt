c) replace the 900 amount with 10
d) replace the 900 amount with 910
b
3. The strItems array is declared as follows: Dim strItems(20) As String. The intSub variable keeps track of the array subscripts and is initialized to 0. Which of the following Do clauses will process the loop instructions for each element in the array?
a)
Do While intSub > 20
b)
Do While intSub < 20
c)
Do While intSub >= 20
d)
 Do While intSub <= 20
b
  
4. The intSales array is declared as follows: Dim intSales() As Integer = {10000, 12000, 900, 500, 20000}. Which of the following If clauses determines whether the intSub variable contains a valid subscript for the array?
a)
If intSales(intSub) >= 0 AndAlso intSales(intSub) < 4 Then
b)
If intSales(intSub) >= 0 AndAlso intSales(intSub) <= 4 Then
c)
If intSub >= 0 AndAlso intSub < 4 Then
d)
If intSub >= 0 AndAlso intSub <= 4 Then
b
  
5. The intNums array is declared as follows: Dim intNums() As Integer = {10, 5, 7, 2}. Which of the following blocks of code correctly calculates the average value stored in the array? The intTotal, intSub, and dblAvg variables contain the number 0 before the loops are processed.
a)
Do While intSub < 4
intNums(intSub) = intTotal + intTotal
intSub = intSub + 1
Loop
dblAvg = intTotal / intSub
b)
Do While intSub < 4
intTotal = intTotal + intNums(intSub)
intSub = intSub + 1
Loop
dblAvg = intTotal / intSub
c)
Do While intSub < 4
intTotal = intTotal + intNums(intSub)
intSub = intSub + 1
Loop
dblAvg = intTotal / intSub − 1
d)
Do While intSub < 4
intTotal = intTotal + intNums(intSub)
intSub = intSub + 1
Loop
dblAvg = intTotal / (intSub − 1)
b
Do While intSub < 4
intTotal = intTotal + intNums(intSub)
intSub = intSub + 1
Loop
dblAvg = intTotal / intSub
where, we calculate the sum in intTotal and average in dblAvg, where average is sum/no.of elements.
  
6. The intSales array is declared as follows: Dim intSales() As Integer = {10000, 12000, 900, 500, 20000}. Which of the following loops will correctly add 100 to each array element? The intSub variable contains the number 0 before the loops are processed.
a)
Do While intSub <= 4
intSub = intSub + 100
Loop
b)
Do While intSub <= 4
intSales = intSales + 100
Loop
c)
Do While intSub < 5
intSales(intSub) =intSales(intSub) + 100
Loop
d)
Do While intSub <6
intSales(intSub) = intSales(intSub) + 100
Loop
c
  
7. What will be assigned to the dblAvg variable after the code has been executed?
Do While intSub < 4
intNums(intSub) = intTotal + intTotal
intSub = intSub + 1
Loop
dblAvg = intTotal / intSub
Dim intNums() As Integer = {10, 5, 7, 2}. The intTotal, intSub, and dblAvg variables contain the number 0 before the loops are processed.
a) 0

Dim intNums() As Integer = {10, 5, 7, 2}. The intTotal, intSub, and dblAvg variables contain the number 0 before the loops are processed.
a) 0
b) 5
c) 6
d) 8
c
9. What will be assigned to the dblAvg variable after the code has been executed?

Dim intNums() As Integer = {10, 5, 7, 2}. The intTotal, intSub, and dblAvg variables contain the number 0 before the loops are processed.
a) 0
b) 5
c) 6
