c
5. In Common Mode Differential Amplifier, the outputs Vout1 and Vout2 are related as:
a) Vout2 is in out of phase with Vout1 with same amplitude
b) Vout2  and Vout1 have same amplitude but the phase difference is 90 degrees
c) Vout1 and Vout2 have same amplitude and are in phase with each other and their respective inputs
d) Vout1 and Vout2 have same amplitude and are in phase with each other but out of phase with their respective inputs
d
6. In a small signal differential gain vs input CM level graph, the gain decreases after V2 due to:
a) As the input voltage increases, the output will be clipped
b) When the input voltage to the transistors are high, the transistor enters saturation region and increases the current, which inturn decreases the output voltage = VDD – Rd.Iss
c) When Common Mode voltage is greater than or equal to V2, the input transistors enter triode region, the gain begins to fall
d) Increasing the input voltage beyond V2 causes the gate oxide to conduct and the gain is reduced
c
