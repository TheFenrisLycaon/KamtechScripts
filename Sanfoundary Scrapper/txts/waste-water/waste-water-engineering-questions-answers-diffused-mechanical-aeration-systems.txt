 Standard O2 Requirement = Theoretical O2 requirement/ Alpha x [Beta x Csw – D.O.] x Theta(Tww-20°C)/ Css= 540/24/[0.7 x [0.95 x 8.64 – 2] x 1.024(30-20)]/9.86=48 Kg of O2/hr.                                                                                                                                                             Air requirement = Actual Oxygen requirement/ (Density of air x % of O2 in air by weight x SOTE%) = 48/( 1.201 x 0.232 x 0.1599)= 875 m3/hr.
